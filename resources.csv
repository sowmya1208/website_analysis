resources_1,resources,Why we need the “social” of social media more than ever,"April 21, 2020

The word has been out for a while. It is no longer an option not to use social media for business. But that’s old news… most business owners, small, medium, or large, already know the power of social networks, and the downsides of thumbing your organization’s nose at them. The questions today’s businesses are really asking: which platforms should I use, how, and when? And for those who dare ask, why?
A bigger gorilla has just entered the room, however. COVID-19 has upended communities across the country and throughout the world; many small merchants are facing uncertainty, downsizing, and sometimes closure. And yet, many are also rediscovering the heart and soul of their business, and adapting to the new reality with impressive speed. The kind of creative, strategic thinking usually driving startups is now blossoming in (home) offices nationwide, and more than ever it’s pulling on the power of relationships: the connections among business owners, employees, customers and clients, suppliers and vendors, and their larger communities.
Never have we needed the “social” of “social media” more than we do now. 
 
This is a two-part series on social media for small businesses in the age of COVID-19.  Here in Part 1, we look at the role social media is playing during the COVID-19 crisis, what that means for small businesses, and how you, as a merchant, can best approach your social media strategy.
In Part 2, we present a list of the main social media platforms with tips and best practices, and a brief overview of three tools you can use to optimize your social media presence.
 
Social distancing means more connection. Wait, what?
It seems contradictory and perhaps counterintuitive, but the more we are forced to socially distance to protect our physical health, the more we crave human connection to protect our mental and psychological health. Articles are beginning to pile up about that here, here, and here.
It doesn’t help that rates of loneliness have doubled in the U.S. in the past 50 years. Or that a former U.S. surgeon general declared loneliness and emotional well-being to be serious public health concerns.
We humans are deeply social animals. Always have been.
For small businesses, especially those that have historically thrived on person-to-person connections in their communities (read: coffee shops, restaurants, small grocery stores, beauty salons, daycares, auto mechanics), an order to shelter-in-place can sound like a death sentence. But here is where the power of virtual social connections can shine, and prove a life-saver, for merchant, employee, and customer alike.
If you already have a social media presence, fantastic. Your job now is to rev it up about a thousandfold. If you don’t, or your presence is small, or you haven’t seen the lift you were hoping for, there’s no time like the present to dive in—and this time with a little extra insight.
 
Before you post, listen
You might be raring to go and set up an entire week’s worth of posts. But remember what your elders always said… listen before you speak. This is particularly true—and relevant—now. Sensitivities and emotions are high; the isolation we’re feeling during this forced quarantine is driving many people to share more of their thoughts and sentiments than has historically been typical, even for a tech-connected society like ours.
Let’s unpack that.
This means the sharing index, if there’s such a thing (well, there is now that we coined the term…) or the volume of messaging, memes, images, likes, comments, and various other ways people can interact through social media, has gone through the roof.
This also means people are spending way more time on their little screens than probably ever before in the history of Homo sapiens. 
This also means the rate of transmission of misinformation is higher than ever before (that “email from a doctor” about holding your breath to see if you have the virus? Myth.).
So what does all this really mean, for the small business owner?
Put simply, it means it’s a much redder ocean now. (Haven’t heard of the red ocean/blue ocean comparison? Nothing like the red pill/blue pill trope, we promise.) Your critically important COVID-19 related news, new store hours, or pop-up special promos, might just drown in a sea of Instagram challenges (push-ups anyone?). 
But it also means more people than ever before are hungry to make that connection, and if your business doesn’t give it to them, an eggdog video will. We respectfully believe your business has a lot more value than eggdog videos (and that’s why we’re not linking to one in this article).
Bottom line is—and here is the key to it all—that if you know how to listen, if you’re willing to listen, you’ll begin to see what your customers, suppliers, and communities need—and what they want. What makes them anxious and what gives them hope. What they’re missing vs what they lack. One of our own merchants, Becky Sunseri of Tin Pot Creamery, says it best: “Small businesses are people.” 
So spend some time scrolling through the social media posts of your followers as well as those you follow, organizations in your community, news outlets, even your local government agencies. Read the comments. Check out Facebook groups, Instagram stories, LinkedIn posts. Email newsletters. TikToks. Get a sense of the ocean you’re swimming in, so you can feel its every ebb and flow. This is the ocean you’ll need to navigate.  
Understanding the what gives you insight into the why, and you can then translate that into the how.
 
To create or to curate
There’s a golden rule that has cast its benevolent glow on many an entrepreneurial effort. It’s the 80/20 rule, aka the Pareto principle. 
Fun fact: the Pareto principle is named after 19th century Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who made important contributions to the study of income distribution and the analysis of individual choice, and who discovered that in many countries, 80% of the wealth was owned by 20% of the population.
The Pareto principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. In business, they say 80% of sales come from 20% of customers. For social media, experts recommend that 80% of your posts be engaging, creative, inspirational, informational. In other words, not intended to sell. The other 20% is where you can dedicate your content and messaging to drive sales. Because, after all, yours is a business.
Let’s drill down into that a bit.
You might have heard an alternate version of this 80/20 rule for social media: 80% should be third-party content, and 20% yours. This misses the point of engaging your audience. It’s not about where the content comes from, it’s about what story it tells, and how it helps you deepen, enhance, or enrich your relationship to, or connection with, the people and businesses in your social spheres. Whether or not the “80%” content is yours or curated from other sources is not critical. What’s important is that you’re the one sharing it, perhaps even offering your own take on it, and that it’s relevant for and speaks to your audiences.
Think of it this way: 80% of your social posts should enrich your network of relationships, and 20% should support your business. Makes sense doesn’t it? Imagine how you’d feel if your favorite coffee shop spent 80% of their time tweeting and posting about their amazing coffee. Sure, you love their coffee. But do you really want to hear about their coffee that often? After a while you’d stop paying attention to their feed—or worse yet, move on to a competitor’s social channel where they share fun videos of their baristas making their favorite latte art designs. And before you know it, you’re in the OTHER coffee shop every morning. Er, picking up curbside of course.
Then there’s the indisputable factor of how our brains work. Yes, at a fundamental level, we crave the familiar. It makes us feel safe and comfortable. But when we see or read something new, our neurons perk up and say, hey, pay attention, we haven’t seen this before. 
All that to say… see why it’s a good idea to put your promotional posts in that 20% bucket?
As we said above, humans are social animals. Our actions are driven by decisions that are in turn motivated by our sentiments. And those sentiments—how we feel about a person or event, or a product, service, or brand—are shaped by our relationships and experiences.
Oh, one more thing. As you work on your own content, don’t worry too much about how professional it looks. Beautiful product images are great, but when it comes to the grittier stuff—the stories of your workers, the challenges you’re facing, or what you’re doing to stand up a new e-commerce website—it’s perfectly fine, and in fact often better, to simply be real. People are increasingly wary of over-produced content, especially video. Many are living a reality that is much harder and more raw than it was just a few months ago, and the media content that denies that reality can easily fall flat—or feel inauthentic or disingenuous. Not to mention that video or images that clearly suggest a large production budget was spent, might call into question how else those funds might have been (better) spent within the community.
 
In Part 2 of this post, we explore the mainstream social media platforms, from Instagram to LinkedIn. We highlight the primary distinctions among them, run through basic best practices, and offer pro tips. So be sure to read on!

This is a two-part series on social media for small businesses in the age of COVID-19.  In Part 1, we discussed the role social media is playing during the COVID-19 crisis, what that means for small businesses, and how you, as a merchant, can best approach your social media strategy.
Here in Part 2, we present a list of the mainstream social media platforms with tips and best practices, and a brief overview of three tools you can use to optimize your social media presence.
 
Strategy comes before content
This might sound like blasphemy, but no, content isn’t king. Marketing strategy really rules the kingdom, and content is its fortress. It’s tempting to just dive right into content creation—and certainly much more fun. All those photo shoots on the beach… Equally mesmerizing are all those likes and followers. But these are just vanity metrics. They don’t guarantee action, sales, or, for that matter, a return on investment of your time or resources.
Marketing strategy requires a much deeper dive than any blog post could possibly offer; entire books—libraries—have been written about it, and about subsets of it (email marketing, content marketing, social media marketing…). Let it suffice to say that your first step, before you dive into the social media pool, is to arm yourself with strategic goals & objectives, and the metrics you’ll use to track those goals and objectives.
In other words, rather than worry about how many people are liking or following your content, we recommend making your business goals very clear. This will help drive your social media marketing strategy. For example, do you want your social media accounts to:

Generate leads
Drive conversion on your website
Improve customer engagement

Next, define your target audience. Who are the people you feel would engage with your business the most? If you’re an established business, you no doubt already have a good sense of your customers. If you’re just starting out, you might need to do a little research—and here’s where social analytics, competitive analysis, and a little social listening can give you gold.
Another area that needs your attention is establishing the metrics that matter to you. Forget likes and yes, even followers. Look at reach—how many unique users are seeing your content? Are they sharing it? Clicks—how many people are interacting with your content, your brand? Hashtags—are people using following or using your hashtags? Which ones? Most critically, how does all this engagement translate for your bottom line?
Having considered all of the above, what kind of stories, narratives, or perspectives are likely to interest your audiences? Perhaps your content is already engaging them, but you want to take it to the next level.
You won’t be able to answer all of these questions straight away; a good marketing strategy is one that evolves over time, and is kept fresh as new data and observations come in. There is much more to a good strategy—so rather than reinvent the wheel, here are links to two organizations that have done the legwork for you:

Hootsuite’s How to Create a Social Media Marketing Strategy in 8 Easy Steps 
Sprout’s How to build your social media marketing strategy for 2020

Now let’s take a look at six of the mainstream social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube.
FACEBOOK
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 2.5 billion
Daily active users (mobile): 1.59 billion
Almost 70% of U.S. adults use Facebook

Facebook is the largest social network on the planet and needs no introduction. Despite all the recent controversy, small businesses can still leverage the power of this platform. A business can have a “page” or a “group”—or both. A page is simply your organization’s or company’s profile, complete with a description, web site, contact info and hours. According to Facebook, two thirds of users it surveyed say they visit the Facebook page of a business at least once a week.
A Facebook group, simply put, is a community. The nice thing about groups is that they notify users of new posts by default; on the other hand, they typically take more effort. Like any other online community, they’ll require your ongoing TLC and non marketing content and interaction. But the potential ROI is significant. Remember the power of relationships we covered in Part 1? A Facebook group can become your virtual village.
Pro tip: Consider using Facebook Live and Facebook Stories. Facebook Live is—you guessed it—a video broadcast live on Facebook. Great format to share your news or announcements in real time. You can even take people on a virtual tour of your restaurant, retail shop, or studio space. Facebook Stories are vertically formatted images or short videos that disappear after 24 hours. They’re seen by half a billion people daily and live at the top of the News Feed, which means they’re not affected by the infamous Facebook algorithm (which can kill your well-intentioned Facebook post). More on Facebook Stories here.
 
INSTAGRAM
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 1 billion+
Daily active users: 500 million
Business accounts: 25 million+

Some social media channels lend themselves more naturally to visuals, and Instagram is certainly one of the most elegant. You might have read articles that wax poetic about Instagram’s soulmate-like connection to the creatives (artists, musicians, actors, and photographers) and their corporate counterparts (fashion and travel brands, restaurants, florists, beauty salons). So if you have a business that doesn’t sell gorgeous product, you should forget about Instagram, right?
Wrong.
Any business can find a way to present itself in a visually appealing way, and use Instagram to its advantage. Just as an image is worth a thousand words, so a story is worth a thousand likes. If you have a story to tell, you can use Instagram. Whether it’s your product, your space, your people, or your customers, you can tell many different kinds of stories. You can post a single image with or without text. A series of images up to 10. A grid of 3, 6, or 9 images that create a visually striking display. Videos (up to 1 minute). You can run an Instagram Story—that tells yours with images.
Pro tip: Make sure you set up—or switch to—a business profile. That makes it easy for your followers to contact you right from your Instagram page. You also gain the ability to run Instagram ads without relying on Facebook, and access Instagram’s analytics, called Insights. You can decide where to drive visitors, and determine the target audience—either a look-alike audience or a new one that you define.
 
LINKEDIN
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 310 million
90 million LinkedIn users are senior-level influencers
Drives over 50% of all social traffic to B2B websites & blogs

LinkedIn is the platform par excellence for professionals and business-to-business (B2B) interaction. As most social media networks, it’s free but also has a paid Premium version that allows you to connect with more people and send messages to people you’re not connected to. It’s a great tool if you’re looking to hire, or be hired. And for B2B marketers, LinkedIn is the absolute heavyweight.
That’s all great, you might be thinking. But should you use LinkedIn if you’re B2C? Say, a restaurant, bookshop, or clothing store. Certainly not the same way or for the same reasons you’d use Facebook or Twitter. Think of LinkedIn as your personal professional network—a great place to connect with other business owners, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders. Think of it as your online village of expertise and knowledge.
Pro tip: If you’re in sales or a small business owner who wants to increase or change their sales funnel, LinkedIn has another paid feature called Sales Navigator. It’s a sales prospecting tool that takes social selling to a new level with the power of LinkedIn’s database. What’s social selling? If you’ve ever posted a picture of your product or a message about your service on social media, you’ve done it. Social selling is leveraging social channels to sell products and services. Here’s more about Sales Navigator from the people who write the “For Dummies” series.
 
PINTEREST
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 335 million
28% of marketers use Pinterest
71% users are female

Pinterest is best for businesses who thrive on visual media. Like YouTube, it’s a visual search engine, but instead of videos it uses “pins.” People who share their visual content are affectionately called “pinners.” Even the company’s stock symbol is “PINS.”
Pinterest is particularly popular with the art, design, and crafting communities, as well as food, furniture, and books. Your business not in any of these areas? Before you write Pinterest off, think about what story your product or service could tell visually. Pins don’t have to be professionally produced magazine-cover photography. You can pin photos of your lattes if you’re a coffee shop. Spa gift sets if you’re a beauty salon. Baskets of bread or pastries if you’re a bakery. You can create infographics that present data, facts, or stats about your industry in an engaging way. Try a series of inspirational quotes against a background, maybe even a wall or window at your store location.
People use Pinterest to shop, get inspired, and share ideas with their friends. So even if one pinner doesn’t click all the way through to your site, she might repin your content and share with her networks. Plus, Pinterest is the fourth most popular social media network in the United States. You heard that right. It ranks ahead of Twitter and LinkedIn, according to Hootsuite (and they should know). It’s also the only social platform that offers visual search—and 62% of millennials and Gen Zers say they want to be able to search by image (see this guide on marketing for Pinterest by Hootsuite).
Pro tip: Just like you can repost in Instagram and retweet in Twitter, you can repin in Pinterest—which helps enhance your boards (collections of pins) without the added effort of creating new content. And did you know about Promoted Pins, available only to businesses? Check out these and many other marketing tips in Buffer’s How to Use Pinterest: Insider Guide for Businesses, informed by Pinterest’s own inhouse team.
 
TWITTER
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 330 million
Daily active users: 152 million
% of users on mobile: 80%

In the words of our own social media expert, Twitter is “the closest social platform to a real-time conversation.” Twitter itself stresses that point—it’s not about the selfie or even the original post, but rather the thread, the exchange, the conversation that the original post galvanizes.
On this platform, visuals are not as critical; text-only tweets are perfectly fine. Twitter is great for news and announcements. For years, the maximum length of a tweet was 140 characters, which the company has now doubled. If that’s still not long enough, you can craft a series of tweets that roll up into a thread—just be sure to annotate each tweet appropriately. If you’ve got a series of five tweets, for example, you’d append “1/5” at the end of the first tweet, “2/5” at the end of the second, and so on.
You can also host Twitter Chats and organize your own collection of Twitter Moments. What are chats and moments? A Twitter chat is an online conversation hosted by a Twitter user (for our purposes, you). You choose a topic for the chat, set the time and date, and create a hashtag that users can use to participate in or simply follow the chat. Twitter Moments are collections of tweets on a theme (access them through the “More” menu just below “Profile.” Twitter has pre-set categories of moments that you can browse through, but you can put together your own and post those on your business profile. For example, you can organize your tweets according to topic: product announcements, events, customer stories, and the like.
And of course, what mature social platform wouldn’t allow its business users to advertise? On Twitter, you can do ads or promoted tweets.
Pro tip: Take advantage of Twitter’s search engine to uncover trending topics, research keywords, or check out how businesses similar to yours are using the platform.
Bonus pro tip: Twitter publishes an annual marketing calendar listing popular events and dates that you can download. The calendar includes tips for tweeting about these events, so don’t miss out on this resource.
 
YOUTUBE
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 2 billion
Daily active users: 30 million
Average viewing session: 40 minutes

You might think of YouTube as the haven for silly animal vines, fail compilations, and alternate universes of teenage gamers, but that’s just one (ok, three) side of this quietly powerful platform. Not only is YouTube the third largest search engine in the world—not second, as marketing mythology would have it, and here’s more on that if you really want to get into it—nearly half of all marketers are thinking about adding YouTube to their mix, according to Hubspot.
You might also think, well that’s all good but my audience isn’t on YouTube. But consider this: according to HubSpot’s research, people spend a third of their online time watching videos, YouTube reaches more people in the 18-49 age range than any broadcast or cable network, and almost 60% of executives prefer video to text.
But we get it. Creating videos isn’t as easy or fast as typing up a tweet or snapping a photo. If you’re not on YouTube yet, it’s not the end of the world, but if you’ve got stories to tell that might really capture people’s hearts (and eyes and minds) better in video, you might want to consider brushing off that camcorder. The good news is, especially these days, that you don’t need a multi-million dollar production to tell a good story on video. As long as you’re clear on strategy, business goals, and what stories will help you achieve those goals, you can harness video more easily than you think. And yes, of course you can promote your videos.
Here’s more on marketing for YouTube from Neil Patel.
Pro tip: When you upload your videos, make sure to select the right thumbnail (the reduced-size image that represents your video in search results, suggestions, and other lists), and to add your logo to it. Thumbnails are what people see when they’re browsing through videos to watch—and the last thing you want representing you in an ocean of videos is a random frame from yours. And why the logo? Even if people don’t click on your video to watch it, they’ll have seen your brand. The next time they see your video, they might just remember that logo, and click on your video as opposed to someone else’s.
 
Get a little help from the pros
Now that you’ve gotten this far, how does it feel? It’s a lot to take in, especially if you’re just starting out on social, or if you’ve been active on some platforms but want to expand. Or maybe you’ve got all your accounts set up, just no time to produce content, engage, respond to people… whatever your specific situation, there are ways you can streamline social.
This is where applications like Hootsuite, Sprout, and Buffer can help. They’re called social media management tools, and they can turn your social media headaches into an enjoyable part of marketing your business. They enable you to set up and schedule posts on multiple platforms, determine optimal times for posting, and let you see how your posts are performing. Let’s dive right in, shall we?
BUFFER
Basic cost: $15 per month, billed monthly (single user)
Buffer is an easy-to-use social media management tool that helps you manage multiple social media accounts, schedule posts across multiple social accounts, and drill down into analytics. Its calendar view feature gives you a good overview of your posting schedule, and it has intuitive, efficient drag-and-drop publishing capabilities.
Buffer can get expensive as you add user accounts, and its scheduling, reporting, and analytics functions cannot, in the words of one review, “compare to those of Hootsuite.” But if you’re looking for a reasonably priced, clean, easy-to-use centralized interface for social media publishing, Buffer is a great option.
 
HOOTSUITE
Basic cost: $29 per month, billed annually
One of the most recognizable names in the social media management space, Hootsuite is a powerful, highly customizable dashboard that allows multiple users (teams) to monitor social analytics, post, schedule future posts, and even manage social advertising.
On the down side (for some), Hootsuite’s most powerful features are available only in the higher-tier enterprise plans, and more advanced users may find the analytics not deep enough.
Overall however, Hootsuite is one of the most open, comprehensive, and integrated social media management tools on the market. It has a wide range of solutions for SMBs (small to midsize businesses), ranging from curation and posting to collaboration and scheduling. It works with over 250 apps and platforms (such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft business apps, and others). PC Mag calls Hootsuite “the Swiss-knife of social media management solutions.”
For more, check out this comparison of Hootsuite vs Buffer.
 
SPROUT
Basic cost: $99 per user, billed monthly
Moving on to Sprout. Sprout Social is Sprout’s social media management tool, a full-service mix of publishing, scheduling, and analytics. It offers strong CRM (customer relationship management, oriented specifically to social media) and reporting functionality, help desk features, as well as social listening and influencer identification.
As one of the first social media management solutions, Sprout has accumulated a deep well of data points and insights from over 25,000 clients, which in turn helps you as a small business user. The only drawback is that the social listening and keyword monitoring options are fairly limited in the Basic tier, which is already the most expensive of the three tools listed here.
 
Note that these are just three of the tools available to you. PC Mag has done an extensive comparison of social media management tools that you might want to check out.

resources_3,resources,COVID-19 Restaurant Survival Guide,"April 7, 2020

Restaurants are among the many small businesses struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guests are staying home and meals are mostly takeout: 92% of restaurant traffic is now outside the dining room, with most states banning in-restaurant dining altogether. We’re facing a long road back “to business as usual,” but there are things your restaurant can do to support your community, care for your employees, and keep the lights on.
Shift your mindset
Before you try to rethink your restaurant workflow, you may need to redesign your mental model. We explored this topic in a recent blog article, but the basic idea is to examine your priorities and set clear intentions rather than functioning only in response to emerging problems or concerns. Running a small business is tough even in ordinary times. Find that conviction, resilience, and strength that brought you to this point. Small business owners are the bedrock of our communities: your family, your employees, and your neighbors will look to you for leadership.
 
Rethink your menu and service offerings
The next step is to find creative ways to use what you have. How can you reimagine your offerings to sustain income while serving your community? Here are some ideas to get you started.

Offer family-style menus…
Modify your menu to offer dishes that travel well, are full of long-lasting ingredients reliably available from your suppliers, and feed a full family. Some restaurants publish a new daily menu each morning to provide options based on ingredient availability. Others are creating freezer-friendly packaging for dishes that are able to be enjoyed later. It’s also helpful to include enough food for leftovers—with reheating instructions of course—as many people are working from home and will need lunch the next day. Specify how many portions come with each dish to help customers assess how much to order.
…and group-sized drinks
Many states are relaxing their alcohol laws during the COVID-19 crisis. New York, New Hampshire, Maryland, Illinois, California, and Texas are just a few places that have all temporarily changed their regulations to allow alcohol delivery, giving restaurants a way to replace lost revenue. Partner with a brewery or alcohol vendor to offer growlers of beer to go. Pair bottles of wine with meals, or pre-mixed margaritas or sangrias with tacos. Alcohol is a great way to increase your restaurant margins and complete a meal for guests.
Offer specialty pricing for certain groups
Some restaurants are earning goodwill by offering discounts or special menus to laid-off industry workers, medical personnel, and elderly people. Specialty pricing gives you an opportunity to use up perishables or ingredients that don’t fit into a newly modified menu. Clear your fridge responsibly by finding ways to help those in need within your community.
Create make-at-home meal kits
Obviously, you don’t want to give away the secret to your special sauce, or your grandmother’s cookie recipe that keeps customers coming back for more. But restaurants can create build-your-own meal kits that still make it easy for guests to enjoy your signature foods. Help families out by creating an ingredient kit for pizza or cookies complete with toppings or other decorating components—not only are you offering a meal service, but also entertainment for kids cooped up in the house. Try a themed kit: brunch party packs, make your own smoothie kits, or an at-home taco bar.
Sell groceries and pantry staples
For those who want a less crowded shopping experience, restaurants can be a lifeline. Sell groceries, unique gourmet items, and pantry staples that you can source directly from your suppliers to offer an alternative way to get food in the house. Groceries also encourage customers to come back frequently, helping your cash flow.

 
Pivot to delivery
Official guidelines for staying at home can change by the day. As foot traffic dries up, here are some tactics to continue serving your guests at their homes.

Switch to online orders or ordering ahead
Pivot to take-out and delivery services to continue serving meals when diners aren’t able to make it to your restaurant. You can ask diners to order meals—especially family-sized portions—at least 24 hours in advance to ensure you’ll have the necessary staff on hand to prepare them. The Clover App Market has many options to get you set up for online delivery and take-out meals: try Chowly, Menufy, or any of the other services. Just enter “delivery” or “food delivery” in the search bar in the upper right. Also, see our recent blog post on how to set up online ordering fast.
Curbside pickup
Curbside pickup is another great option for restaurant guests no longer able to, or choosing not to, dine out. Curbside pickup refers to order pickup by the customer, at the restaurant. Typically the customer will park outside, often in a designated space, while a runner brings the order out to the car. This is where mobile, handheld POS devices—like the Clover Flex—come in very handy.Redesign your take-out protocols to account for customers who won’t be entering your establishment. Encourage repeat visits by adding a “bounce back” card with the take-out meal, offering something special on the customer’s next visit (with a tight expiration date).
Contactless payment
Exchanging payment physically is one of the easiest ways to transmit germs. In the Clover POS ecosystem, all of our devices, including Flex, our mobile POS, have contactless payment built in. Contactless payments are a fast, secure, and hygienic way for your guests to close their tab with a debit card, credit card, or mobile device. Simply tap and go—a great option for curbside or in-restaurant pickup.
Set up an e-commerce site
Set up an e-commerce page or an entire website to give customers a way to order and pay remotely. If you have them, include non-perishable grocery items, like your restaurant’s special sauce, grocery items, or pantry staples, as additional items for sale. Here’s how to set up an e-commerce site that can provide an additional revenue stream for your restaurant.

 
Financial relief
The COVID-19 crisis has forced numerous restaurants and bars across the country to close or downsize. Below is a list of resources you can explore to help stem the cash-flow drain your business might be experiencing.

Private partnerships for restaurant owners:

The James Beard Foundation Relief Fund is offering micro-grants to independent restaurants in need

New resources for restaurants are coming online regularly, so bookmark this post as well as the Clover financial resources page.
More ways to stay connected
Just as chefs try to make the most of every ingredient at their disposal, so you can see what other aspects of your business might help you weather this crisis. There are numerous ways to connect with your guests. With a little creativity, you can build or strengthen your connection with your community, and in some cases even lower your costs .

Streamline your hours. Keep costs down by opening only during peak times. We’re seeing some restaurants reducing their hours to 4:30 – 8 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.
Host a cooking class. Have your chef create a video, webinar, or live Instagram video showing at-home cooks how to make some of your favorite dishes.
Do away with extras. Plastic utensils not only present an additional cost, but they’re also bad for the environment. Skip adding disposable utensils to your take-out orders unless a customer specifically requests them.
Throw a virtual dinner party. For those who are in solo quarantine, host a virtual hangout so diners don’t have to eat alone. Be sure, however, that the video conferencing platform you’re using has the proper security protocols in place.
Offer activities for kids. Post fun things for kids to enjoy. For instance, if you’re a seafood restaurant you might think about ocean-themed arts and crafts activities parents can download to keep their kids busy during the lockdown.

Make use of your restaurant’s social media channels and email to stay in touch with customers while your dining room is closed.
Communicate, communicate, communicate
Restaurants thrive first and foremost because of their people. Your team is integral to your success: from your chef and kitchen staff to your hostess and servers, your people make your business. Don’t be afraid to touch on the very real and human side of the COVID-19 crisis when you talk to your staff, suppliers, customers, and the larger community.
Communicate the things you are doing to stay open to your customers and your employees. Transparency is key here: make sure everyone is aware of the steps you are taking to keep everyone safe, from hygiene and sanitation to relief and flexible approaches to work.
Finally, don’t forget that marketing—with an eye toward sensitivity—is still important. Hard sells won’t go over well: many people are struggling economically with the current waves of layoffs. Instead, let your customers know whether or not you’re open, how you’re physically providing meals (through curbside pickup or delivery) and how they can order or support you. This is a time to communicate more, not less.
This is a crisis, but it’s also a challenge, and small business owners are often the first to step up to the plate in times of need. Strategize how you can redesign your menu to make the most of your ingredients, cut down on waste, and support customers stuck at home. Revamp the dining experience. Use your social media channels to create a virtual experience, keep customers connected, and stay in touch as the situation evolves. And don’t forget there are financial relief options out there to support your employees and hold you over until the situation improves.

Avoiding Foodborne Illness 
Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.  
Foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses, like norovirus and hepatitis A, can make people ill through contaminated food. SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness.

Food Supply Chain




Where should the food industry go for guidance about business operations? (Updated April 20, 2020) 




Food facilities, like other work establishments, need to follow protocols set by local and state health departments, which may vary depending on the amount of community spread of COVID-19 in a particular area. We encourage coordination with localExternal Link Disclaimer health officials for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where they have operations. Also see the CDC's What Grocery and Food Retail Workers Need to Know about COVID-19.








Why are there empty shelves at the local grocery store, while we see reports of food being dumped or crops being plowed under? (Posted April 14, 2020)




In some cases the inventory of certain foods at your grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock. Based on our ongoing communication with industry, we understand this is largely an issue of unprecedented demand from the retail sector – not a lack of capacity to produce, process and deliver.
Food production and manufacturing are widely dispersed throughout the United States, however; there is a significant shift in where consumers are buying food, because of the pandemic. While food use in large-scale establishments, such as hotels, restaurants, sports arenas/stadiums and universities suddenly declined, the demand for food at grocery stores increased. FDA has issued temporary guidance to provide flexibility in packaging and labeling requirements to support food supply chains and get foods to the consumer retail marketplace.








Where should I send questions if we are having problems moving food or getting food through areas that have curfews and restrictions because of the coronavirus? (Posted March 20, 2020)




If you are experiencing issues regarding your supply chain, delivery of goods, or business continuity, please contact the FEMA National Business Emergency Operations Center at NBEOC@fema.dhs.gov. This is a 24/7 operation and they can assist in directing your inquiry to the proper contact.








What measures are FDA (and CDC, state partners, etc.) taking to ensure that we remain able to address foodborne illness outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic? (Posted March 17, 2020)




Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory, not gastrointestinal, illness. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.
With respect to foodborne pathogens, CDC, FDA, and FSIS continue to work with state and local partners to investigate foodborne illness and outbreaks. FDA’s Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation (CORE) Network manages outbreak response, as well as surveillance and post-response activities related to incidents involving multiple illnesses linked to FDA-regulated human food products, including dietary supplements, and cosmetic products. During this coronavirus outbreak, CORE’s full-time staff will continue to operate to prepare for, coordinate and carry out response activities to incidents of foodborne illness.
FDA’s Center for Veterinary medicine manages outbreak response for animal food and is similarly staffed and prepared to respond to incidents of foodborne illness in animals.




Social Distancing, Disinfecting & Other Precautions




Do you have best practices to share with retail food stores, restaurants, and food pick-up and delivery services that cover safe food handling, as well as employee health? (Updated April 20, 2020)




FDA is sharing information about best practices to operate retail food stores, restaurants, and associated pick-up and delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic to safeguard workers and consumers. The information in two convenient formats addresses key considerations for how foods offered at retail and restaurants can be safely handled and delivered to the public, as well as key best practices for employee health, cleaning and sanitizing, and personal protective equipment (PPE).  See Best Practices for Retail Food Stores, Restaurants, and Food Pick-Up/Delivery Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Also see the CDC's What Grocery and Food Retail Workers Need to Know about COVID-19.








How do I maintain social distancing in my food production/processing facility and food retail establishment where employees typically work within close distances? (Updated April 5, 2020)




To prevent spread of COVID-19, CDC is recommending individuals employ social distancing or maintaining approximately 6 feet from others, when possible. In food production/processing facilities and retail food establishments, an evaluation should be made to identify and implement operational changes that increase employee separation. However, social distancing to the full 6 feet will not be possible in some food facilities.
The risk of an employee transmitting COVID-19 to another is dependent on distance between employees, the duration of the exposure, and the effectiveness of employee hygiene practices and sanitation. When it’s impractical for employees in these settings to maintain social distancing, effective hygiene practices should be maintained to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. Also, see Should Employees in retail food and food production settings wear face coverings to prevent exposure to COVID-19? (Posted April 4, 2020).
IMPORTANT: Maintaining social distancing in the absence of effective hygiene practices may not prevent the spread of this virus. Food facilities should be vigilant in their hygiene practices, including frequent and proper hand-washing and routine cleaning of all surfaces.
Because the intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak may differ according to geographic location, coordination with state and local officials is strongly encouraged for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.
Sick employees should follow the CDC’s What to do if you are sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).








Should employees in retail food and food production settings wear face coverings to prevent exposure to COVID-19? (Posted April 4, 2020)




On April 3, the CDC released an updated recommendation regarding the use of cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19. CDC recommends the use of simple cloth face coverings as a voluntary public health measure in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).
For workers on farms, and in food production, processing, and retail settings who do not typically wear masks as part of their jobs, consider the following if you choose to use a cloth face covering to slow the spread of COVID-19:
Maintain face coverings in accordance with parameters in FDA’s Model Food Code sections 4-801.11 Clean Linens and 4.802.11 Specifications.
Launder reusable face coverings before each daily use.
CDC also has additional information on the use of face coverings, including washing instructions and information on how to make homemade face covers.
NOTE: The cloth face coverings recommended by CDC are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.








How and when should workers in food retail and processing wear gloves during a pandemic? (Posted April 1, 2020)




FDA’s Food Code recommendations for hand washing and glove use in food service and retail food stores have not changed as a result of the pandemic. (Food Code 2017 Section 2-301.11). Per the FDA Food Code: with limited exceptions, employees may not contact exposed, ready-to-eat foods with their bare hands and shall use suitable utensils such as deli tissue, spatulas, tongs, single use-gloves, or dispensing equipment (Food Code 2017 Section 3-301.11). Gloves are not a substitute for hand washing or hand hygiene.
If your task requires direct contact with ready-to-eat food, wash your hands and the exposed portions of your arms for 20 seconds prior to donning gloves and before touching food or food-contact surfaces. Wash your hands immediately after removing gloves.








Will FDA/EPA approve off-label use of quaternary ammonium sanitizer at 200 ppm as a hand sanitizer for checkers and customers? It is currently on the EPA approved list for use in retail to sanitize food prep areas, dishes etc., and we would like to use it instead of gel hand sanitizer due to the lack of availability. (Posted March 23, 2020) 




We are aware of temporary out-of-stock conditions of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Several manufacturers of these products have indicated that they are working to replenish supplies. In addition, the FDA has issued guidance for the temporary compounding of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers by pharmacists in state-licensed pharmacies or federal facilities and registered outsourcing facilities. See Immediately in Effect Guidance for Industry: Policy for Temporary Compounding of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency. FDA has also issued guidance for the temporary preparation of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products by firms during the public health emergency (COVID-19). See Guidance for Industry: Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-191).
Hand sanitizers are not intended to replace handwashing in food production and retail settings. Instead, hand sanitizers may be used in addition to or in combination with proper handwashing. CDC recommends that everyone wash their hands with plain soap and water. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers may be used if plain soap and water are not available.
As an interim measure, we understand some food establishments have set up quaternary ammonium hand-dip stations and sprays at 200 ppm concentration. These products are intended for use on surfaces, and as such, may not be formulated for use on skin. FDA is aware of adverse event reports from consumers using such products as a replacement for hand sanitizers and advises against using these products as replacements for hand sanitizers.








Are workers in the human and animal food and feed sector considered part of the essential critical infrastructure workforce? (Posted March 20, 2020) 




Yes, in a guidance issued by Department of Homeland Security on March 19 Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure workforce: Ensuring Community and National Resilience in COVID-19, workers in the Food and Agriculture sector – agricultural production, food processing, distribution, retail and food service and allied industries – are named as essential critical infrastructure workers. Promoting the ability of our workers within the food and agriculture industry to continue to work during periods of community restrictions, social distances, and closure orders, among others, is crucial to community continuity and community resilience.








What steps do I need to take to clean the facility/equipment to prevent the spread of COVID-19? (Posted March 17, 2020)




FDA-regulated food manufacturers are required to follow Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) and many have food safety plans that include a hazards analysis and risk-based preventive controls. CGMPs and food safety plans have requirements for maintaining clean and sanitized facilities and food contact surfaces. See: FSMA Final Rule for Preventive Controls for Human Food.

Food facilities are required to use EPA-registered “sanitizer” products in their cleaning and sanitizing practices.


In addition, there is a list of EPA-registered “disinfectant” products for COVID-19 on the Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2 list that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogen program for use against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.


IMPORTANT: Check the product label guidelines for if and where these disinfectant products are safe and recommended for use in food manufacturing areas or food establishments.


We encourage coordination with localExternal Link Disclaimer health officials for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.


Food facilities may want to consider a more frequent cleaning schedule.









How do I handle self-service food buffets such as salad bars in a retail setting related to COVID-19? (Posted March 17, 2020) 




Restaurants and retail food establishments are regulated at the state and local level. State, local, and tribal regulators use the Food Code published by the FDA to develop or update their own food safety rules. Again, there is no current evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food or food packaging.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. The coronavirus is mostly spread from one person to another through respiratory droplets. However, it’s always critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—clean, separate, cook, and chill—to prevent foodborne illness.
As an extra precaution to help avoid the transmission of COVID-19 through surface contact, we recommend frequent washing and sanitizing of all food contact surfaces and utensils. Food-service workers also must practice frequent hand washing and glove changes before and after preparing food. Include frequent cleaning and sanitizing of counters and condiment containers. Consumers should wash their hands after using serving utensils.
In communities with sustained transmission of COVID-19, state and local health authorities have implemented social-distancing measures which discourage or prohibit dining in congregate settings. We also recommend discontinuing self-service buffets and salad bars until these measures are lifted.
Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.








Do I need to recall food products produced in the facility during the time that the worker was potentially shedding virus while working? (Posted March 17, 2020)




We do not anticipate that food products would need to be recalled or be withdrawn from the market because of COVID-19, as there is currently no evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food or food packaging.
Additionally, facilities are required to control any risks that might be associated with workers who are ill regardless of the type of virus or bacteria. For example, facilities are required to maintain clean and sanitized facilities and food contact surfaces.




Temporary Policy




How does FDA’s temporary flexibility regarding the Egg Safety Rule help during COVID-19? (Posted April 6, 2020)




The Temporary Policy Regarding Enforcement of 21 CFR Part 118 (the Egg Safety Rule) During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency provides producers of shell eggs that normally would be sent to facilities for further processing, the flexibility to sell their eggs for distribution to retail locations, such as supermarkets, when certain conditions are present. This flexibility will help egg producers meet increased demand for shell eggs by consumers at retail locations while still ensuring the safety of eggs.
See the Constituent Update (FDA Provides Temporary Flexibility Regarding the Egg Safety Rule During COVID-19 Pandemic While Still Ensuring the Safety of Eggs) for more information.








How does the temporary guidance regarding packaging and labeling of shell eggs help during COVID-19? (Posted April 6, 2020)




FDA issued this guidance to provide temporary flexibility regarding certain packaging and labeling requirements for shell eggs sold in retail food establishments so that industry can meet the increased demand for shell eggs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
See the Constituent Update (FDA Provides Temporary Flexibility Regarding Packaging and Labeling of Shell Eggs Sold to Consumers by Retail Food Establishments During COVID-19 Pandemic) for more information.








How does the temporary policy on Preventive Controls and FSVP Food Supplier Verification Onsite Audit Requirements help during the COVID-19 public health emergency? (Posted April 6, 2020)




In this temporary guidance for receiving facilities and FSVP importers, the FDA made clear its intent in certain circumstances related to impact of the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), not to enforce requirements in three foods regulations to conduct onsite audits of food suppliers if other supplier verification methods are used instead. The three regulations are:
Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food (21 CFR part 117)
Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals (21 CFR part 507)
Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals (21 CFR part 1 subpart L)
See the Constituent Update (FDA Issues Temporary COVID-19 Policy for Receiving Facilities and FSVP Importers in Meeting FSMA Supplier Verification Onsite Audit Requirements) for more information.








Is FDA providing flexibility regarding the nutrition labeling of packaged food for restaurants and other businesses? (Posted March 27, 2020)




As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, restaurants and food manufacturers may have food not labeled for retail sale that they wish to sell at retail. The FDA has released a guidance document to provide restaurants and other businesses with flexibility regarding nutrition labeling so that they can sell certain packaged food during the COVID-19 pandemic.




Workers Testing Positive




What if a worker reports being in close contact with another worker on the job tested positive for COVID-19? (Posted April 14, 2020)




Consult CDC’s Interim Guidance for Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Workers Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19. It includes the following:
Pre-Screen: Employers should measure the employee’s temperature and assess symptoms prior to them starting work. Ideally, temperature checks should happen before the individual enters the facility.
Regular Monitoring: As long as the employee doesn’t have a temperature or symptoms, they should self-monitor under the supervision of their employer’s occupational health program.
Wear a Mask: The employee should wear a face mask at all times while in the workplace for 14 days after last exposure. Employers can issue facemasks or can approve employees’ supplied cloth face coverings in the event of shortages.
Social Distance: The employee should maintain 6 feet and practice social distancing as work duties permit in the workplace.
Disinfect and Clean Work Spaces: Routinely clean and disinfect areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared electronic equipment.
Sick workers should follow the CDC’s Steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if you are sick.
Additional Resources
The Food and Beverage Issues Alliance has developed protocolsExternal Link Disclaimer for (1) when an employee of a firm is a confirmed or presumptive case of COVID-19 and (2) when a facility employee/facility visitor/customer has been in close contact with an individual with COVID-19. This protocol is specific to food manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and wholesale and retail outlets.








A worker in my food production/processing facility/farm has tested positive for COVID-19. What do I need to do to continue operations while protecting my other employees? (Updated April 14, 2020) 




All components of the food industry are considered critical infrastructure and it is vital for the public health that they continue to operate.
Instruct sick employees to stay home and to follow the CDC’s What to do if you are sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clean and disinfect surfaces in the employee’s workspace. Inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality. Instruct employees who are well, but have been exposed to COVID-19, to notify their supervisor and follow CDC’s Interim Guidance for Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Workers Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19.
Federal Government Resources
Businesses should consult the CDC’s Interim Guidance for Business and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019, which is frequently updated.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also issued Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19 that includes information on how a COVID-19 outbreak could affect workplaces and steps all employers can take to reduce workers’ risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).
Additional Resources
The Food and Beverage Issues Alliance has developed protocolsExternal Link Disclaimer for (1) when an employee of a firm is a confirmed or presumptive case of COVID-19 and (2) when a facility employee/facility visitor/customer has been in close contact with an individual with COVID-19. This protocol is specific to food manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and wholesale and retail outlets.








If a worker in my food processing facility has tested positive for COVID-19, should I test the environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus? (Posted March 27, 2020)




Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, we do not believe there is a need to conduct environmental testing in food settings for the virus that causes COVID 19 for the purpose of food safety. Cleaning and sanitizing the surfaces is a better use of resources than testing to see if the virus is present.
Facilities are required to use personnel practices that protect against contamination of food, food contact surfaces and packaging and to maintain clean and sanitized facilities and food contact surfaces. Although it is possible that the infected worker may have touched surfaces in your facility, FDA-regulated food manufacturers are required to follow Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs). Maintaining CGMPs in the facility should minimize the potential for surface contamination and eliminate contamination when it occurs. With the detection of the coronavirus in asymptomatic people and studies showing survival of coronavirus on surfaces for short periods of time, as an extra precaution, food facilities may want to consider a more frequent cleaning and sanitation schedule for high human contact surfaces.








A worker in my food processing facility/farm has tested positive for COVID-19. What steps do I need to take to ensure that the foods I produce are safe? (Posted March 17, 2020)




Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 by food. Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.
If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality. Sick employees should follow the CDC’s What to do if you are sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Employers should consult with the local health department for additional guidance.
While the primary responsibility in this instance is to take appropriate actions to protect other workers and people who might have come in contact with the ill employee, facilities should re-double their cleaning and sanitation efforts to control any risks that might be associated with workers who are ill regardless of the type of virus or bacteria.

As the events surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak unfold, it’s understandable that you might begin to feel increasing stress.

Information is rapidly changing and can be confusing, overwhelming and even scary. You may experience fear and spikes in anxiety. But even if you’re managing your anxiety levels well, there’s still so much more to deal with.
Whether it’s dealing with at-risk family members or patients, a roller coaster economy, trying to juggle work, keeping kids occupied or homeschooling while schools are closed, or simply adjusting to a new, unfamiliar situation, stress can easily pile up and negatively impact you — both physically and mentally. 
Clinical psychologist Amy Sullivan, PsyD, ABPP, stresses the importance of planning coping activities. “America is the engine of ingenuity,” she says. “Let’s be innovative. This is a time where we can really be creative and come up positive coping skills.”  

5 steps for managing your stress
Exercise regularly. While gyms are closed and social distancing guidelines are in place, it’s still possible to get in aerobic exercise, like walking, running, hiking or playing with your kids/pets, all can help release endorphins (natural substances that help you feel better and maintain a positive attitude). And there are other exercises you can do in the comfort of your own home. Dr. Sullivan recommends yoga and stretching as one way to both exercise your body and calm your mind and it’s easy to do by yourself. 
Maintain a healthy diet. Stress can adversely affect both your eating habits and your metabolism. The best way to combat stress or emotional eating is to be mindful of what triggers stress eating and to be ready to fight the urge. “If you are someone who is prone to emotional eating, know your triggers, know what stresses you out and be prepared,” Dr. Sullivan says. Keeping healthy snacks on hand will help nourish your body, arming yourself nutritionally to better deal with your stress. “Helping to regulate your blood sugar throughout the day is going to keep your body stable and your emotions on a much better playing field,” Dr. Sullivan says.
Take a break. “As humans we want control over our lives and in this situation, so we have to learn to manage lack of control,” says Dr. Sullivan. While it’s important to stay informed of the latest news and developments, the evolving nature of the news can get overwhelming. Find a balance of exposure to news that works for you. This is particularly important for our children. We need to limit their exposure to the media and provide age-appropriate information to them. Whenever reasonably possible, disconnect physically and mentally. Play with puzzles, a board game, do a treasure hunt, tackle a project, reorganize something, or start a new book that is unrelated to coronavirus coverage. 

Connect with others. “I can’t stress enough how important connection is during times of uncertainty and fear,” Dr. Sullivan says. “Fear and isolation can lead to depression and anxiety. We need to make a point to connect with others regularly.” Reach out to family members, friends and colleagues regularly via phone, text, FaceTime or other virtual platforms. Make sure that you are checking on those that are alone. Check in regularly with your parents, grandparents and your children.
Get sleep and rest. The ever-changing news environment can create a lot of stress, stress that gets amplified when you don’t get enough sleep. It’s especially important now to get the recommended amount of sleep to help you stay focused on work and on managing the stress the current outbreak can bring. Dr. Sullivan recommends avoiding stimulants like alcohol, caffeine and nicotine before bed. If you still find yourself too stressed to sleep, consider developing a new pre-bedtime routine, including a long bath or a cup of caffeine-free herbal tea. And planning for tomorrow earlier in your day can help alleviate stress related to what’s to come. 
Following these steps to manage stress and add a sense of normalcy can go a long way to help you cope with the ever-changing environment and help keep those around you, especially children, calm and focused. If you are not able to manage your anxiety or depression on your own, reach out to a behavioral medicine provider for an in-person or virtual visit.  “Take care of yourself and others around you,” says Dr. Sullivan.

resources_19,resources,11 tips for managing your anxiety during the coronavirus outbreak,"Amy Morin is a psychotherapist, licensed clinical social worker, mental strength coach, and international bestselling author.Many Americans struggle with anxiety, and for many people it's reaching an all-time high in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.Whether you're concerned for the safety of older family members or worried about balancing working from home with a partner or children, here are 11 things you can do to prevent your stress from becoming overwhelming.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

If your anxiety is sky high right now, you're not alone. The coronavirus pandemic is affecting our everyday lives in multiple different ways — and things are changing at such a rapid pace that it's impossible to know what to expect next.Whether your kids are out of school indefinitely, or you're not sure how your small business is going to survive, managing anxiety is key to making the best decisions possible for you and your family. Here are 11 strategies that can help you keep anxiety in check as you deal with the coronavirus pandemic.












1. Create a schedule










                                              Maintain a structured daily routine.
                                            

                                                Kate Aedon/Shutterstock
                                              


Your daily routine might be disrupted in a number of ways. Whether you're working from home, or can't go to the gym, the lack of structure in the face of uncertainty can cause you to feel even more anxious.Every night, sit down and create a schedule for the following day. Identify what you can do during each hour of the day — including things like exercise, cooking meals, reaching out to friends and family, cleaning the house, and working. Incorporate healthy activities into your day, and try to keep a similar daily routine in the process.








2. Limit the time you spend consuming media










                                              Try not to spend the entire day reading news articles.
                                            

                                                Shutterstock
                                              


Don't leave the TV on in the background so you can stay informed, and don't flip through social media randomly. Consuming too much media will keep your anxiety sky high.Studies show that watching the news causes a spike in anxiety (even during the best of times). Worse than this, your anxiety is likely to stay elevated for a while after you stop watching the news. So can you imagine what it does right now when you're listening to reports of ""death tolls"" every few minutes? It's likely to keep your anxiety stuck in a perpetual heightened state, which is never good for you.So while it's important to stay up-to-date, consuming media all day isn't necessary (or healthy). Decide when you want to get the latest news — perhaps in the morning and again in the evening. Then, resist the urge to read articles and watch news throughout the rest of the day.








3. Choose what media you consume carefully










                                              Be informed about what you choose to watch.
                                            

                                                Shutterstock/Blackregis
                                              


Research shows that the type of media you consume affects your well-being. It may even influence how likely you are to keep yourself safe. A 2009 study that examined how Australian and Swedish media outlets each reported on the H1N1 influenza pandemic found that both outlets reported accurately on the risk of contracting the illness. Swedish outlets, however, focused their reports on how viewers could reduce their risk of getting sick, while Australian media chose to report mostly on public agency missteps during the outbreak.Prior to the outbreak, both countries had similar vaccination rates. After the outbreak, the vaccination rate was 60% in Sweden and 18% in Australia.So be proactive about which news programs you choose to watch as well as who you follow on social media. Look for media that reports on concrete, healthy actions you can take — rather than ones that report on all the things going wrong. This may help you feel better, and it could motivate you to take more positive action.








4. Exercise










                                              Do an at-home workout.
                                            

                                                Halfpoint Images/Getty Images
                                              


With so many gyms closed and warnings to practice social distancing, it may be harder to find time and space to work out. But physical activity can greatly reduce anxiety.And while any type of exercise might help you feel better, some studies have found that strength training is especially effective in reducing anxiety.If you've got some dumbbells, use them. If not, use your bodyweight or some resistance bands. Doing so can build both your physical and mental muscles.








5. Label your emotions










                                              Be honest with yourself about what you're feeling.
                                            

                                                Sladic/Getty Images
                                              


Putting a name to your emotions can take a lot of the sting out of them. A study conducted by researchers at UCLA found that labeling feelings reduces the intensity of them.Take a minute to check in with yourself several times each day. How are you feeling? Anxious? Overwhelmed? Frustrated? Sad? Confused? Whatever you're feeling is OK. Acknowledging rather than fighting your feelings can help you move forward.








6. Balance your emotions with logic










                                              Balance your worries with logic and facts.
                                            

                                                Jacob Lund/Shutterstock
                                              


It's normal to experience intense feelings right now. And these emotions lead to a lot of unhelpful and even catastrophic thoughts that can fuel your anxiety.So it's important to balance out emotions with logic. Take a look at the facts. And when you start thinking the world is ending or you can't get through this, remind yourself that pandemics end, economies rebound, and people survive.








7. Argue the opposite










                                              If you're feeling pessimistic, challenge yourself by saying something optimistic.
                                            

                                                Thomas Barwick/Getty Images
                                              


When you find yourself thinking things like, ""The coronavirus is going to wipe out my business,"" or, ""I'm never going to get through this,"" then argue the opposite.Remind yourself that there's also a chance things will turn out better in the end or that you're going to emerge from this stronger than ever. The goal of arguing the opposite isn't to convince yourself that everything is perfect or that amazing things are definitely going to happen.Instead, it's about helping you see that your catastrophic predictions aren't destined to happen. There's a chance that things might go well or turn out better than you're imagining. Develop a more realistic middle-ground outlook, rather than a doom and gloom sort of stance, so you can start to feel better.








8. Maintain social support










                                              Find ways to virtually stay in touch with friends.
                                            

                                                Apple
                                              


Fortunately, our electronic devices allow us to stay easily connected even while we're social distancing. And while video chatting doesn't provide all the same emotional benefits of face-to-face contact, electronic means of communication do allow you to maintain social support.If you don't have close friends or family members to reach out to during this time, find people you can talk to. Look for forums, social media groups, or others who want to connect. Talking to other people about what you're going through can reduce your anxiety. Just make sure you're talking about strategies that help you feel better and not making catastrophic predictions that fuel your anxiety.








9. Focus on the things you can control










                                              Put your energy into things you can affect.
                                            

                                                Getty Images
                                              


The more you focus on things you can't control — like how much the coronavirus is spreading or business closings that will affect your day-to-day life — the more anxious you'll feel.So focus on things you can control, like steps you can take to keep yourself safe, how you'll spend your time, and how you'll manage your money. Gaining a sense of control over something can help you gain inner peace.








10. Externalize your anxiety










                                              Your anxiety can be caused by external factors beyond your control.
                                            

                                                Associated Press
                                              


Narrative therapy is a common form of treatment that is a simple but effective way to get some fast relief. It involves externalizing your anxiety so you can recognize how it affects you and how you can fight it.Rather than say, ""I'm feeling awful,"" remind yourself, ""Anxiety tries to make me feel awful."" Acknowledge how your anxiety causes you to think things that aren't true like, ""Anxiety tries to convince me I can't handle one more thing going wrong!"" Recognize how it tries to get you to behave in a way that keeps you stuck in a perpetual state of anxiety such as, ""Anxiety tries to make me pace in circles rather than get something productive done.""Viewing anxiety as an external force can help you find ways to combat it. You may decide you can best fight anxiety with sleep and exercise. Or you might decide anxiety doesn't like it when you practice yoga. You can even turn it into a game of sorts where you practice different strategies to learn what helps you best fight off the anxiety.








11. Schedule time to worry










                                              Put it in your schedule, and put it aside until that time.
                                            

                                                wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock
                                              


It sounds ridiculous on the surface. If you worry a lot, why on earth would you schedule time to worry? Well, researchers have found that scheduling time to worry is a great way to limit the amount of time you spend ruminating and making catastrophic predictions.Set aside a certain timeframe to worry, and put it in your schedule. Perhaps you decide to worry from 7:00 to 7:15 p.m. every day. If you catch yourself worrying outside of this time frame, then remind yourself that it's not time to worry right now.Then, when your worrying time hits, sit down and worry as much as you can during this timeframe. When the time is up, move onto something else. With practice, you'll likely find it's an effective way to keep your worries contained.

Your Clover touchscreen glass has an anti-fingerprint, oil-repellent coating, so you’ll want to take extra care when you clean the glass.
When you clean your device:

Only use a soft, lint-free cloth, like a microfiber cloth you might use to clean glass lenses.
Moisten the cloth with water to wipe off dirt and smudges.
Moisten the cloth with 70% - 90% strength Isopropyl alcohol to disinfect the unit and the touchscreen. (You'll need at least the 70% solution to disinfect for the COVID-19 coronavirus.)
Do not spray anything directly on the device; instead, spray on the cloth.
Take extra care to avoid getting alcohol or water into or around openings, buttons, or seams, and areas where you dip or swipe cards and connect cables. If you need to clean those areas, make sure the cloth you use is dry.
Don’t use abrasive cleaners or solvents.
Avoid too much moisture of any kind.
Allow the unit to dry before switching it on again.

Enable Fast Pay With CashAllow Fast Pay With Cash to save time when taking a cash payment in the Register app. When set, you can make a cash payment immediately after taking an order and without having to tap Pay and choose tender type.To enable fast pay with cash:

On a web browser, log in to the Web Dashboard.
Click Setup.
Click Payments.
Select Enable Fast Pay With Cash in Register.
Click Save.
Enable cash back Use this option to offer cash back to customers when a debit card is used to pay for an order. Set cash back options to display default amounts.
 Although cash back is only available on Clover Mini, Mobile, and Flex, you can use the Station and Station 2018 to set up this option. To add support for Cash Back (only for Debit transactions):

On a web browser, log in to the Web Dashboard.
Click Setup.
Click Payments.
Select Enable Cash back.
(Optional) Click Edit to adjust cash back options:
Enter an amount in each cash back field.
Click Delete ? to delete an option.
When there are fewer than 6 options, you can add another by clicking ADD CASH BACK OPTION.
Click Save.
Set device to log out after each orderUse this option to automatically log out an employee after each order is completed. This means the cashier will have to log in to take the next order.
 Using employee cards to quickly unlock your Clover device instead of entering a passcode also ensures that employees will not be locked out if they forget their passcode. To automatically log out after completing an order:

On a web browser, log in to the Web Dashboard. 
Click Setup.
Click Payments.
Select Log out after each order.
Click Save.
Enable offline payments on the Web DashboardThe offline payments option is device specific. If you use more than one Clover device, you can enable or disable the option on each device you use. When enabled, devices can take offline payments for up to 7 days.
The offline payments option is enabled by default for:

Clover Station
Station 2018
Clover Mini
Flex
Mobile 

When a connection becomes available, your device automatically submits offline payments for authorization, and once authorized, you receive your deposits and your customers receive receipts.
 When you take an offline payment, you accept the risk of a declined or partial payment when the device is back online. For example, if a credit card is expired or cancelled, or if the PIN is incorrect, the payment will be declined.
This functionality doesn't work with Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) or gift cards. 
To set offline payment options:

Open the Setup app.
Select Payments.
In the Offline payments section, select Edit.
For each device, select one of the following:
Do not allow offline payments. The Clover device declines all offline transactions.
Allow offline payments
Set  Offline payment limitations: 
Limit each offline payment amount to $__
Set the limit for a single offline payment. For example, if you set the limit to $50.00, offline payments of $50.00 or lower are accepted, and offline payments of $50 or higher are declined or require the merchant's confirmation. 
Limit total offline payments to $__
Set the total not-to-exceed amount for offline payments on this Clover device. For example, if you set the limit as $400, this Clover device will not take   offline payments after the total amount of all offline payments reaches $400.
Require merchant approval for each offline payment over $
Set the maximum amount allowed in an offline payment before requiring approval. To disable this option, set the limit to the same amount set in Limit each offline payment amount to $_. 
Tap Save; then tap Allow.  
Set up signature settings???Set customer signature requirements.

Signature entry location
You can have customers sign on your Clover device or on a printed paper receipt. Customer signatures taken on the device also appear on online web receipts. Using the device option speeds up the payment process, saves receipt paper, and allows you to keep an electronic copy of the customer's signature.
No signature requirement
For faster payment, you can allow customers to pay without a signature for small transaction amounts. For example, if a sandwich shop sets a threshold signature requirement to $20.00, customers whose orders are under $20.00 do not have to enter a signature. This keeps the line moving quickly, and more customers can be served during the lunch rush. 

 The signature threshold does not apply to payments on FD40 Pin Pad devices. Asking for a tip always requires a signature, regardless of payment amount. 
To set signature requirements:

On a web browser, log in to the Web Dashboard.
Click Setup.
Click Payments.
Click Signature entry location.
Select one of the two options from the drop down menu next to Ask for signature and tip:
Select On tablet screen to ask for signatures on the Clover device.
Select On printed receipt to ask for signatures on printed receipts.
Click Save.

To set a minimum amount before requiring a signature: 

On a web browser, log in to the Web Dashboard.
Click Setup.
Click Payments.
Click Signature Requirement.
Select Don't require a signature if transaction is under $____.
Enter your desired amount in the Amount field.
Click Save.

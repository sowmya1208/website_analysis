But as his business grew, he realized he couldn’t be everywhere at once. Here’s how he uses technology to make sure every aspect of Meatball Joe runs smoothly, whether he’s there or not.

Joe Paolercio can’t really remember a time without his grandmother’s famous Sunday sauce. As he grew up, he proudly became an official taste tester for her, learning each step in making her perfectly-balanced sauce with meatballs.
Now, years later, Joe runs Meatball Joe, a food truck slinging meatballs of all types. He proudly offers traditional Italian-style, chicken, risotto, and even veggie balls that delight customers. They use locally sourced ingredients including fresh local vegetables and antibiotic- and hormone-free meats.
Launched in early 2016, Joe was savvy about investing in technology up front, and did research to select the point-of-sale system that would be best for him.
“I ended up with the Clover because i just needed something to process credit cards. What I didn’t know is that my credit card processing machine could be so much more. When the Clover was introduced to me, I started to gather what the Clover could represent in my business.”
One example Joe cites is tracking his sales. “If I didn’t have the Clover, I would have to account for every meatball that went out this window by hand, and then hope, at the end of the day, week, or month, that my notes were accurate and legible.”
With Clover, it’s easy to track not just bottom line figures, but detailed breakdowns showing the most popular items, and the busiest times. If you have a food truck, for example, it is crucial to see which locations yield higher sales overall, and to track geographic preferences for different products.
As Meatball Joe gains momentum, Joe has had to hire additional staff. He said Clover allows him to stay up-to-date on all of the issues related to his business whether he’s physically there or not.
“When I hand things off to people, it’s difficult to let go, but you have to. Because I can’t be everywhere and I can’t do everything,” he said. “[Clover]’s been the tool that allows me to be at my business without physically being at my business.”
Delegating is a difficult task for entrepreneurs, but even Forbes thinks that successful business owners must establish a team before it is absolutely necessary. For a business to thrive, it has to have space to expand and grow.
Assigning tasks and responsibilities to others has been good for Joe. “It gives me more time to address other things, because while the service is the most important part of my business, there are so many things that go into making sure that service goes off flawlessly.”
At the end of the day—and the days are always long for business owners—it helps to know that a business is engaging in best practices for organizational tracking. Joe says it perfectly, “When you lay your head down at night, know that you did everything you needed to do, and hopefully you’ll be able to sleep.”

news_1,news,"Protect yourself: PCI, EMV, and You","This post will give you a quick glimpse into what you need to do to protect yourself from the looming threats of non-compliance with PCI (Payment Card Industry) and EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) standards.…",27-03-2016,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/protect-yourself-pci-emv-and-you/,"As a small business owner, you always want to do all you can to keep things running smoothly. One of the biggest areas of concern for small businesses today is compliance and data security. The difference between outdated processes and being fully compliant with your POS is as dramatic as night and day. It could mean the difference between being held financially responsible for non-compliant transactions and/or having credit card data compromised. This post will give you a quick glimpse into what you need to do to protect yourself from the looming threats of non-compliance with PCI (Payment Card Industry) and EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) standards.
We’ll start with PCI compliance. Simply stated, being PCI-compliant means a merchant is doing everything according to the Data Security Standard. One of the quickest ways to determine where your business stands is by going online and visiting PCI Rapid Comply Solution. It’s a simple PCI-compliance wizard that helps you find out how well you’re adhering to the latest security standards. It even has next steps to follow to make your compliance process as easy as possible.
Next up, EMV. In October 2015, all businesses that accept electronic payments were required to have EMV-compliant point-of-sale systems. EMV-compliant systems are capable of reading the extra security layers transmitted by EMV chip-enabled cards. When businesses don’t have a compliant point of sale system, they are automatically liable for any fraudulent transactions if they accept payment from an EMV chip card. So, being EMV-compliant means a merchant has the latest hardware to take the next-generation payment cards with the new security features. Ready to jump in? Go here.
Finally, let’s look at POS security. This is generally where you’re most vulnerable to data breaches.With Clover Security, you get the latest end-to-end encryption and tokenization technology to help protect your customers’ data from the moment their card is swiped. Knowing your POS system is protected ultimately provides the peace of mind you need to focus on doing what you do best—running your business.
Compliance isn’t just a good idea—it’s required. Lucky for you, if you have any questions about PCI, EMV or your POS, you can give us a call or send us an email. We’re always happy to help!

Here’s a look at some recent changes that occurred in the world of small business lending.
 
The state of post-recession small business lending
After the great recession of the late 2000s, most of the country’s major banks greatly reduced the number of small business loans they would issue per year. In addition to becoming considerably more risk averse post-recession, Karen Mills, the former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration noted that banks got out of the business of making small business loans because of the comparatively small ROI involved. However, with the economy now recovered from the hit it took in the recession, some of America’s biggest banks are reconsidering their lending habits.
 
A change in big banks’ thinking
In a recently published Entrepreneur article, Lisa Stevens, an executive vice president with Wells Fargo, revealed that her company is now very interested in issuing loans to qualified small business owners. She further explained that one in ten U.S. small business loans are now issued by Wells Fargo, and they only anticipate that number will increase in the near future. So why the about-face? Well, in addition to small businesses nationwide having better cash flow and less debt than they did in 2007, the small business lending market has gotten a lot more competitive in the last nine years.
 
The rise of the online lenders
For previous generations, the only way to get enough capital to start or expand a small business was getting a bank loan or securing funding from an independent investor. With the rise of the internet, entrepreneurs can now seek funding from a range of different online lenders. Companies like OnDeck, Kabbage and CAN Capital have enjoyed incredible success by offering small dollar loans to burgeoning entrepreneurs using a big data approach. Instead of just analyzing cash flow, credit score and assets, these online financiers use social media data and transaction volume to make their lending decisions. Seeing as OnDeck was recently evaluated at $1.5 billion, it’s no wonder that the big banks are interested in reentering what has turned out to be a very lucrative market. Whatever their motivation, the fact that banks are issuing more small business loans is good news for entrepreneurs.

news_3,news,Make change work in your favor,"Buzzwords like “change,” “adapt,” and “evolve” are often thrown around in regards to company policies, but with the exception of very small businesses and budding startups, it seems as though many companies are slow to implement meaningful changes.

Even if those changes are made, they are may be lost after a few months or even a few weeks as the lure of the “old way” overcomes the façade of evolution.
Yep, let’s face it: Too often, desired changes fall flat.
How can you keep this from happening in your business? One secret is to be on the lookout for impediments to change. Here are the Top 7 issues that can, and probably will, come up:
1. Changing Too Much At Once
Change can be difficult, and one of the worst things you can do is to try and change everything at once. Whereas one change can present a solvable issue, many changes happening at once can result in a mess of confusion and insurmountable challenges. Instead, lay out a timeline for implementing changes gradually.
Bingo! Problem solved.
2. Refusing To Plan Past The Foundation
Once you have decided on a plan of action regarding company-wide changes, be absolutely sure you follow that plan through to the end. Not only is it disheartening to watch your plans fizzle, but by implementing some changes while abandoning others you are setting your business up for failure.
3. Rewarding the Old Ways
When make new changes within your business, it’s important that you alter the reward structure of your business to reflect those changes. If employees are still being rewarded based on old metrics, those are the things they will continue to do, and your changes will be slow to catch on if they catch on at all.
Before you put changes in place then, take time to refocus rewards on desired new outcomes.
4. Failing To Communicate The Vision
Have you ever tried to get directions from someone who knows where they’re going, but can’t explain how to get there?
No fun, that.
Indeed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to lead people to a new place if you can’t explain the journey in words they will understand. You need to be able to break down your vision for your company in a way that is clear, precise, and easy to understand. If everyone is not clear about the path, the chances are high that you won’t get to where you want to go.
5. Assuming Change is Easy
The only people who will tell you change is easy are people who will turn around and try to sell you their course on change.
Change always comes with challenges, even the smallest disruption to the status quo carries with it some confusion, clarity issues, and unforeseen circumstances. Planning for the worst will ensure that you have enough resources allocated to handle anything that comes your way, and if you get through a period of change relatively quickly, that just means you’ll have more resources for the next one.
6. Changing the Actions, Not the Culture
If there is a huge need for change within the company, more often than not it’s more to do with the culture of the company as a whole, and not necessarily specific actions. Therefore, when looking over making changes to improve your company’s overall functioning, be sure to address cultural issues within the company that may be hurting your productivity and success.
7. Leadership Doesn’t Change
Time and again, businesses fail to adapt to change because the leadership employs a “Do what we say, not what we do” attitude when it comes to implementing those changes. Who will follow that? No one.
Executives, boards, and other people in leadership roles need to set the example for employees by wholeheartedly adopting new way. They should also be able to explain the reasoning behind the changes, and to break down what the company hopes to accomplish by implementing them.
When everyone sees their leaders embracing change, they will be more likely to do it as well.

Traditionally you’ve taken credit cards and debit cards, and as always, cash is king, but what about other forms of payment?
Specifically, what about checks?
If you look at the numbers, there’s a lot of life left in checks. For example, in a recent study, the Federal Reserve reports over 18 billion checks being paid with a total value of $26 trillion dollars—and that’s just paper or electronic checks alone.
So you see, there’s still a lot of money being exchanged via checks—but if you’re still not sure that checks are right for your business, we’ve compiled the following reasons you should reconsider:

Checks are very popular among consumers. How popular, you ask? According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, millions of U.S. customers have checking accounts, but do not have a credit or debit card. In addition, a different study concluded that 90% of U.S. customers have a checking account. Considering their near ubiquity, perhaps you should consider adding this tried and true payment method.
Checks give consumers more options. That is, according to small businesses. According to a recent study by TeleCheck, 71% of small businesses agree that checks allow them to offer their customers more payment options.
Checks make consumers feel safer. According to 2015 TeleCheck research, many customers choose checks because they believe checks are less susceptible to fraud than payment cards. If you want to provide safe payment options, checks might be the way to go.
Checks pay more than other forms of payment. Did you know that the average credit card swipe is $50, and that the average check amount is 3x that? Bigger tickets for you mean bigger payoffs for your business, which is something every business owner strives for.
Checks don’t require someone to be internet/smartphone savvy.According to the Pew Research center, 15% of U.S. adults don’t use the internet. With such a resistance to technology, it’s important to businesses to cater to these consumers by offering payment options that they’re comfortable with—and that means checks.

Whether you’d like to admit it or not, checks are still alive and kicking, with millions of dollars being paid by checks every day by millions of consumers. If you’d like to capture your business’ share of those dollars, it’s important you offer a wide array of payment options that every consumer is comfortable, and today, those options still include checks.

news_5,news,Mobile loyalty programs that work hard for your business,"Generally, each January, there are a lot of people rushing out to the gym to get memberships.

Have you ever been one of those New Year’s resolution-eers who start the year with the best of intentions, only to never end up using your membership?
Making a mobile loyalty program work for your business is a lot less work than hitting the gym, but in both cases, it’s impossible to achieve results if you don’t actually use it.
No loyalty program, no matter how good it is, will show significant results unless the merchant uses it consistently and correctly.
For both merchants and customers, most mobile loyalty programs are a breeze to use, but it only works if you work it.
Here are five steps to ensure success with your mobile loyalty program:
1. Try to observe if a newly arriving customer already has your loyalty program installed. With a loyalty program, generally you’ll know when a customer is already using a loyalty app, because they will “check in” via the consumer app on their mobile phone upon entering. But if they don’t check in, or give any other indicators of participating in your shop’s mobile loyalty program, this is a good time to ask, “would you like to receive rewards for shopping here?”
I highly recommend that your clerk use this exact phrasing because when put this way, customers will almost always say yes. Once the customer agrees, your clerk should reply, “great, let’s get you started.”
If the customer has any problems downloading the mobile loyalty app, the clerk should help out or find someone who can. It only takes a minute and now the merchant has “captured” another potential loyal customer. Alternatively, you can do all this at the time of payment.
2. Make whatever you use to validate program users very accessible.Depending on which mobile loyalty program you use, how you validate customers may vary, but regardless, make that validation process easy for employees. Having the validator near employees, or built into the POS, shows them the customer’s name and face as soon as they check in allowing the clerk to greet the customer by name effortlessly.
One barista told us that he never greeted customers by name because the validation screen was behind him. I’ve heard of many businesses have making the same oversight by placing the validator screen outside the clerk’s natural line of sight. Without this visual cue, the opportunity to greet the customer by name is lost.
3. Greet customers and shoppers by name. It is one of your most powerful loyalty-building actions. The sweetest sound to the human ear is the sound of our own name spoken by another, so take advantage of this powerful tool if your mobile loyalty program allows it. As soon as your customer checks in with their mobile loyalty app, their name and (if uploaded) their picture shows up on the validation screen, enabling the clerk to greet them by name.
Make sure that your clerk actually does greet each and every customer by name if your loyalty program allows it, and does so in a friendly, natural manner, without fail.
The personal recognition established when greeting the customer by name is the “open sesame” of customer loyalty, which translates to customer retention and regular visits.
4. Make the giving of rewards a happy and seamless experience. Make sure to have the customer rewards (whatever “prizes” you are offering for purchase behavior), readily on-hand, making it easy for your clerk to retrieve rewards to give to your customer. Making the experience easy to deliver and seamless to implement will not only make your employee more likely to deliver the optimal loyalty program experience,  but it will also make the visit a positive and more memorable experience for you customer.
5. Use a secret shopper. As the business owner or general manager, you absolutely should send in a “secret shopper” to verify that your mobile loyalty program training is being followed.  Do this randomly at least a few times per year to ensure your loyalty program’s success. It’s your business; it’s up to you to protect it.  Doing so could spell the difference between your loyalty program becoming a thriving success–or a disappointing failure.

news_6,news,eCommerce: Local business’ best friend,"If you own a local business, does eCommerce matter to you? It should. Merchants often think of eCommerce as something that’s only for big, national or global businesses.

It should.
Merchants often think of eCommerce as something that’s only for big, national or global businesses. Conventional wisdom says that if you own a mom-and-pop retail shop, a food truck or restaurant, or even a multi-location small business, your market isn’t large enough to justify an investment in eCommerce. Most of your customers are local, and they know you. At least, that’s what many business owners think.
But is that really true?
Today, many consumers use smartphones and online searches to find products, services, deals, and business locations near them. Results from a Google study indicate that 50 percent of consumers are more likely to visit a store after performing a local online search via their smartphone1. In fact, nearly 1 in 5 local searches are followed by an in-store purchase within one day2.
Consider these examples of how local retailers are discovering ways that eCommerce can help their business:

Local car dealerships generate sales leads by using online car comparison sites to link potential buyers directly to dealers nearest the customer.
Salon owners can proactively fill appointment books through e?mail or texting campaigns during     off-peak times.
A local baking business is driving traffic to online ordering pages by using social media for photo sharing of freshly baked cupcakes.
A surf shop can demonstrate the latest surfboard by sharing a video demonstration of how to catch a wave with the latest surfing techniques.
For many businesses, giving shoppers the option of ordering and paying online from any device, and picking up the purchase in the store, is a huge advantage.

Most local businesses recognize that having a website is an essential part of doing business today. But what’s the best eCommerce strategy for your business? That depends on a lot of things. One of the best places to start is to contact an eCommerce specialist who can show you how eCommerce can help grow your business.

Having dreams of long lines of virtual customers queueing up from around the world?
Before you throw open your virtual doors, make sure you’ve taken into consideration the following.
Well-defined eCommerce business plan.
Whether your eCommerce site is the first and only place you will do business, or it’s an extension of your existing business, you need to treat it with the same respect and undergo the same amount of planning as opening a traditional brick-and-mortar location. Though your eCommerce business plan will probably be much shorter than a traditional business plan, make sure you’ve addressed at least these key questions:

What are you selling?
Who is your target customer?
What is the problem you customer has — and how does your product solve that problem?
Who are your competitors in this space? What are their strengths and weaknesses — and how do you compare?
How does your eCommerce site directly build on your competitive point of differentiation?

Clear eCommerce value proposition.
You wouldn’t open a brick-and-mortar store named “Stuff,” because new customers wouldn’t know what you sold, and even existing customers would be a little wary of what they might find upon a return visit. Yet many eCommerce sites make the mistake of not clearly stating their value proposition.
Whether it’s “We are your reliable online source for fashionable eyeglass frames,” or “We provide digital consulting services for environmentally conscious ore mining,” a visitor to your site needs to immediately recognize what it is that you do for them.
High-quality product images.
One of the biggest hurdles to buying online is the inability to physically touch the product you’re purchasing. Don’t make things harder for your customers by using low-quality product images. Make extra effort to show the product views that you know your customers want. For example, some of the best online clothing retailers combine whole body shots, fabric and detail close-ups, and even short video clips of the clothing item on a real, moving model. You’re creating a virtual “fitting room” experience — and you don’t want dirty mirrors.
Tailored product descriptions.
Along with the product image, the brief description is replacing the entire experience of talking with an expert salesperson in a store. Going beyond stock product descriptions is a great way to nurture the value proposition of your eCommerce site. The descriptions should demonstrate your familiarity with the product and your confidence in its value.
Clear shipping & return policies.
Visit any major eCommerce site and you’re sure to see a mention of their shipping and return policies featured prominently — at all times — at the top of the page. If you offer free shipping or flat-rate shipping, flaunt it to your customers. Even if you’re not using your shipping and return policies as a differentiator, make sure that a link to your policies is prominently displayed, and that the policies themselves are easy to understand. Your customers are taking a leap of faith in buying online; you need to reassure them that everything after the purchase will follow a logical and reasonable order.
Reliable cart design.
If a store regularly had a 30-minute wait just to checkout, you can bet they’d lose plenty of customers halfway through the line. Plenty would never return. And, imagine if you got to the register and were told, “Sorry, looks like the register isn’t working at the moment. If you’d like to go to the back of the line, it might be working by the time you get up here again.” This is essentially what you’re doing to your customers when you don’t create a simple, reliable, and fast shopping cart and checkout process. Of all the different aspects of your eCommerce site to test and re-test, your checkout and cart functionality is likely the most critical.

But the age-old question is: how do you attract new customers? There’s clearly not a one-size-fits-all answer. (Otherwise, EVERYONE could do it.) But we do have seven things you can try to get your products or services in front of a new audience. They’re simple, inexpensive, and best of all—they work.
 
1. NEW never gets old: If you’ve been in business for a while, you probably have some “go to” marketing tricks you rely on. But a word of warning: the more you go to that well, the drier it’s going to get. Don’t forget—people love new. New helps shake things up, increasing the chances that your message will hit home with someone different. Print a flyer. Create a coupon. Buy billboard or bus bench space. Have a contest. These are just a couple of quick thoughts on new tactics you can take for a spin.
 
2. Did we mention the word ‘new?’: Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. That’s why using the same marketing ploy too many times can be crazy bad for business. Offering something different, like a product, and letting people know about it, is the perfect way to get different people to check out what you’re all about.
 
3. Make everything click: Unlike your physical store, your URL never closes. No matter the state of your site (more on that in a bit), the secret to making money online lies in getting as many eyeballs to view it as possible. The more people who visit, the more likely you are to make a sale. The two best ways to get more clicks? SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and buying clicks with PPC (pay-per-click). Social media linkbacks work well, too.
 
4. What’s the good word?: Nothing works quite like word of mouth recommendations from a friend. It’s easier than you think to create an incentive referral program that can yield great results. The key? Give existing customers a compelling reason to refer business to you (aside from your every day excellence) and then remember to thank them for doing so. People like to be appreciated and told that their opinions matter.
 
5. Smile and dial: Whether it’s cold calling or sending out proposals, every so often you just gotta prospect. Do some search engine research, get a list of potential leads, and then get to it. Two things to keep in mind:
1. Don’t take ‘no’ personally.
2. You’ll miss out on 100% of the prospects you don’t contact. Keep going!
6. Make sure your site is up to snuff: Time to revisit what we said in #3. Did you know that 80% of Americans now spend as much time online as they do in front of the television? That means your site needs to be top-notch. Lucky for you, there’s a whole host of free, template-based site creators available online that make creating an eye-popping professional site easier than ever. There are even options to add full e-commerce support.
 
7. Get (social) networking: More and more, people are turning to social media to get info on companies they’re interested in. And why not? It’s quick, easy and anonymous. In fact, the numbers of “active Internet users” in a recent poll support that theory:
· 72% of respondents at least sometimes checked out a company’s reputation online before buying
· 74% based their buying decisions, at least partially, on what they read
· 81% thought that blogs, online rating systems and discussion boards gave them valuable feedback
The takeaway? Build up your social media and be as active as you can. People expect two-way conversation today, so the more you can talk with your users, the more likely they’ll continue connecting with you.
 
And, there you have it. Seven (possibly) new tricks that can make your day-to-day lives a little easier. We understand marketing doesn’t come naturally to everyone. In fact, we’d guess most small businesses hate having to try to toot their own horns. And that’s exactly why we’re here. We always want to do all we can to help you attract, engage and retain new customers.

Unfortunately, as these high-profile breaches garner attention, they’ve left small business owners with the impression that hackers and cybercriminals don’t bother targeting small businesses.
How wrong they are: A survey by the Ponemon Institute found that more than half of all small business had experienced a data breach, with 53% reporting multiple breaches. However, only 33% of those businesses notified those customers affected by the breach, despite the legal requirement in 46 states to notify individuals when personal information is compromised. This could leave these small businesses on the hook for tens of thousands in fines and legal fees, in addition to the significant costs of recovering from a data breach.
The lack of awareness, the resulting lack of preparedness, and the lack of— and the resulting lack of preparedness — could end up costing your business in a major way.
One Chicago-area small business owner learned this lesson the hard way. He received an email from his credit card processor, telling him that MasterCard had identified a compromise within his electronic POS system. Following an investigation, the processor claimed the breach was the result of the lack of basic security on the merchant’s part. A year later, he was still paying off more than $22,000 in expenses his business incurred as a result of the breach.
Could a data breach happen to you? Absolutely. Small businesses experience compromises every day. Even though the volume of electronic payment data that passes through small merchants’ POS systems is relatively small, it’s low-hanging fruit to a cyber-thief who doesn’t have to work to obtain that poorly protected data.
That’s why it’s as important as ever for your business to implement strong data security solutions, and to prepare a comprehensive data breach response plan.

Beyond kindergarten, the fun of bean-counting quickly fades. But, there are 5 simple things you can do to make your regular inventory counts less painful for you and your staff:
1) Plan for better storage.
A well-organized stock room is key to fast and efficient counts, and this starts with strategically planning the layout and organization of your stock room. Make sure you have designated shelving or storage units for all pieces of inventory — don’t make the “I’ll just put this here for now” mistake. Consider how to organize or arrange the space so that inventory can be most easily identified and counted. Then, make it a priority for your employees to keep this space neat and organized at all times. This way, an inventory count doesn’t start with cleaning — and doesn’t end with searching for needles in a haystack.
2) Visually separate counted inventory.
With all the technology that exists to make inventory management easier, one of the most reliable ways to ensure accurate counts is to create visual separation between the counted and uncounted inventory. If you have room, consider creating a designated space for the counted inventory. Alternatively, consider creating a clear and intuitive marking on all counted items or storage units.
3) Before the count, ship it out.
The less inventory there is to count, the fewer opportunities for mistakes. Before a planned count, try to ship out all existing orders. On the opposite side of that coin, delay all inbound inventory shipments until after the count is completed.
4) Get creative with small inventory.
Very small and very light items can be very difficult and very exhausting to count individually — and are often the least expensive items in your inventory. Find creative ways to reduce the need to individually count these items whenever possible. A sensitive scale can be a valuable tool, enabling you to count out a given quantity of the small item and use that standard weight to extrapolate for the remaining quantity.
5) Prioritize inventory accuracy.
In the rush to fill an order, it’s tempting to sidestep processes and create inventory headaches down the road. Make sure your employees prioritize all inventory processes — and reward inventory accuracy just as you do sales volume.
Let’s face it: Your staff will likely never be enthused about an inventory count. But by taking some time to consider and plan for this critical part of your business operations, you can make more accurate, a lot more efficient, and maybe even a little less painful for everyone involved.

I know I’d pull my hair out trying to get as much done as I do in my business without them! Now, everyone’s got their favorite tools, but I wanted to dig and find some new ones that will help me (and you!) get the most out of our workdays. Here is a list of the six must-have innovative apps that will make you more efficient in your small business.
1. My 1-3-5 List
Too many of us have a daily to-do list that is long. It’s sometimes a challenge to prioritize what needs to get done first. That’s why I like the simplicity of the My 1-3-5 List: you simply put one big task, three medium tasks, and five small tasks on the list. Just the act of deciding where each to-do goes helps me prioritize. And I need all the help I can get all of my work done!
2. Yast
Ever wonder where your day has gone? Yast will tell you. This intuitive time tracker lets you see which projects you’re spending time on, as well as how long you’re on the phone throughout the day. If you’ve got staff, you can also track their time and create time sheets. This app will really show you how productive your team is each day.
3. IFTTT
Have you ever wished you could set something up to automatically complete a task after something else happens? Like once someone buys something off your website, they automatically get added to your email list? IFTTT will do that for you. It integrates tons of tools you probably already use, like MailChimp, social media sites, WordPress and more. You can use existing “recipes” to create common tasks, like post your Instagram photos to Twitter. It saves you the time of having to manually do whatever that task requires. It saves valuable time in my world.
4. Pocket
If, while you’re browsing the internet, and you stumble across articles of interest but don’t have time to read them then, you need a way to come back to them later. Otherwise, you might never get around to reading them. That’s why I like Pocket: you can save articles, videos, and links to view or read later. And when you’re ready to retrieve what you put in your Pocket, you can access it from any device.
5. Humin
As your business grows it will become more difficult to place names and faces. If your phone is filled with redundant entries (one for email, one for work phone, one for LinkedIn profile), Humin will help you clean up those contacts and make sense of them.  This mobile app will help you see who you and a contact have in common as friends, jot your memory about how you met someone, or give you the lowdown on who you’re about to meet in that sales meeting. The best part with this app: You can conserve that part of your brain you previously spent trying to remember details about people.
6. Google Keep
Yet another innovative tool is Keep from Google. When you need to take notes, you sometimes use scraps of paper or even the generic note-taking app in your phone. But Google Keep is intuitive: you can create a to-do list or agenda that pops up when you reach your business meeting, as well as add notes, lists, photos, and audio reminders through your phone or computer.
Every time I write a roundup of productivity apps, there’s something new and exciting out there.
What apps and tools do you recommend?

But out of all the crucial tasks that entails, one stands out above the rest: identifying your target customers. And while it’s great to think literally everyone will come running for your products or services, that’s just not how it works in real life. Heck, even the best products miss the mark with most audiences. That’s why you need a gameplan to help you define exactly who your target market so you can start your business off on the right foot. Here are eight steps you can follow to help you do just that.
1. Know the problem(s) you solve
It’s the million dolllar question: why are you in business? Hopefully, it’s to solve a specific problem with your goods or services. Once you’ve identified the problems you solve, write them down.
2. Who benefits the most from your solutions?
Now, think about all of the different groups that face the problems your business solves. Think in terms of who has the greatest need and whose needs are most urgent. (For example, if you sell low-fat ice cream, one problem you solve is enjoying a sweet frozen treat without greatly increasing unhealthy fat intake. Most people face this problem, but those facing serious health issues, or who pay particular attention to health and fitness, stand to gain the most from your solution.)
3. Start a customer profile
Next, begin describing these people in detail. Be sure to include:

age
gender
income level
buying habits
occupation or industry
marital status
family status (children or no children)
geographic location
ethnic group
political affiliations or leanings
hobbies and interests

The more of these you can lock down, the more your ideal audience will come into focus.
4. Go psycho(graphic)
This isn’t as crazy as it sounds. Psychographic means going beyond basic demographics of your target audience to consider their personality traits, attitudes, values and beliefs, and general lifestyle. In other words, do your best to capture how they think. What you uncover can go a long way in helping you build the foundations of your business, including everything from logo design to the tone of your marketing language and promotions to the culture you create within your office.
5. Be specific
Generalities will do you no favors. So, try to hone your target audience as sharply as possible. The more specific you get, the better chance you’ll have of crafting effective marketing they’ll like and respond to.
6. Don’t reinvent the wheel
Checking out who your competition is targeting (and how they’re addressing them) is a great way to bring clarity to your intended market. After all, your goal is to make their customers your own, right? Beyond helping you see what’s working for your product, studying your competition also allows you to see how your target audience might differ from your competition. This insight can help you come up with unique positioning to solve the same problem.
7. Get outside opinions
At this point, market research can be a great tool for verifying and evolving your target market and customer profile. Surveys, individual interviews and focus groups can help you learn what was right with your customer profile and, more importantly, what you need to adjust. Don’t be afraid to take this on on your own or enlist the help of an expert agency.
8. Ask questions
More specifically, ask these questions after you have a complete customer profile and defined target market and before you start marketing:

Are there enough people in my target market to support my business?
Will my target market clearly see the need for my product or service, or will I need to educate them on the need?
What will drive the final decision to buy?

If you’re happy with the answers you come up with, then you know you’re ready to start coming up with your actual marketing.
 
We’ve shown you the steps you can take to begin to get a better idea of who your target market is and some of the best ways to start thinking about marketing to them. Just remember—keep your focus on the customer problems you’re trying to solve. In doing so, your marketing will hit the mark—and your sales will hit the roof.

In general, most business owners and managers, from mom-and-pops to Fortune 500s, are now growing increasingly aware of the value and significance of focusing on customer loyalty. Nevertheless, small- and medium-size businesses (SMBs) continue to focus the much of their marketing budget on attracting new customers even though many studies have proven that keeping and growing the value of current customers costs just a fraction of what bringing in new customers costs, and can lead to a very substantial increase in profits.
Given the fact that these enterprise-level businesses have done much of the exploratory work, SMBs can learn from their successes and mistakes when developing loyalty marketing programs of their own. In addition, there now exists a number of affordable loyalty program tools available to an SMB-size budget.
Below, we’ve compiled some of the lessons we’ve learned studying Fortune 500 loyalty programs that a SMB can use when designing a loyalty program of their own. When evaluating these tips, it’s important to keep in mind that it’s not the specifics of execution that matter, but rather the principles that lie behind them that count.
Successful customer loyalty solutions share the following overarching principles:
1. FLEXIBLE, PORTABLE, INTEGRATED
As we looked at a number of Fortune 500 loyalty programs, a major theme presented itself time and again: that is, a good program is adaptable to changing circumstances. The reward program and its rewards should easily flow from websites to social media, from advertisements to signage to the customer service interaction, day in and out.
2. INNOVATIVE, EXPERIMENTAL
Consistency in marketing and loyalty plans is not the same as blind adherence to the letter of the law. Keep the basic intentions behind the plans, but keep them updated to changes in the market, technology and any other relevant circumstances. Being different is part of good branding. Try new things and keep your efforts fresh while building on what’s already working.
3. MAKE IT WORTHWHILE WITH GENEROUS REWARDS
Loyalty program rewards need to be commensurate to the amount of investment on the part of the consumer; a free dessert in return for ten full course meals is not a reward, it’s an insult. Certainly you should watch your costs, but bear in mind that when it comes to acquiring new customers, many businesses spend money with wild abandon. Treat your existing customers right and they’ll be loyal for years to come. On the other hand, take them for granted and it will be very hard bring them back.
4. CARING AND PERSONAL
Today’s technologies allow for more personalized attention with very little effort or financial outlay. Talking with your clients via social media is just one of many solutions. Try to engage in a dialogue; don’t just broadcast monologues. Tell customer stories, recognize your own peoples’ efforts, and incorporate feedback into your marketing efforts so they know you’re listening. If you don’t have the time, delegate more, but be sure you’re participating in this valuable feedback loop, since they’ll be talking about your business whether or not you’re there.
5. TIERED REWARDS
Make sure your program is rewarding your best customers at a better rate than beginners. Customers love being recognized for their purchase behavior (provided you’re not selling some highly-personal hygiene product or the like). Create tiers, accelerate your rewards structure based upon purchase behavior, and recognize your all-star customers and you’ll have a program that keeps your best customers happy while encouraging purchase behavior.

It’s a strategy that has worked well for many small businesses to date. However, as big business takes full advantage of big data to gain valuable customer insights, it’s likely your larger competitors are gaining ground — or maybe they’ve already outpaced you.
The good news is corralling vast amounts of complex customer data and making data-driven decisions isn’t just for large corporations with deep pockets and sizeable IT departments anymore. Thanks to the proliferation of cloud-based services, social media, mobile applications and analytics tools, small businesses can now harness custom insights to strengthen customer relationships, improve marketing efforts and enhance products or develop new ones.
Here are some tips for how you can make big data work for your small business:
1) Find a Partner that Understands You
It’s true that many marketing automation solutions designed to manage big data were developed for large enterprises. And, it’s very likely the providers of those solutions aren’t accustomed to implementing or customizing their technology for the needs of small business. However, as more and more big data companies emerge, you will find among them many entrepreneurs who have started out small and built their business on being nimble — just like you. Seek out partners who have an understanding of small business and offer either solutions that are just right for you or are willing to tailor solutions to your specific needs.
2) Start with Your Website
There are plenty of website analytics tools you can pay for, but Google Analytics is a free web performance monitoring tool that you can implement right away simply by adding a tracking code to your site. It provides a wealth of insight into your customers’ behavior, how they interact with your site and short- and long-term trends. While there is a learning curve to take full advantage of the program, once you’re up to speed you will find it’s worth the time and effort investment. Plus, there extensive tutorials available online. Here are just some of insights you can glean from Google Analytics:

How much traffic your site generates and where visitors go when they get there.
What social media channels are performing and referring visitors to your site.
How many visitors are using mobile devices — even the specific device type.
What your visitors are interested in, their age and gender.
How much revenue your e-commerce site generates and how long it takes for customers to make a purchase decision.

3) Consider Multiple Solutions
Typically, big data solution providers have one solution designed for big corporations that come with a high price tag and require a complex set to skills to run and manage. There’s little to no flexibility for smaller operations. Often, small businesses do better with multiple solutions that work with specific business systems and applications already in place for sales, marketing, human resources and accounts payable. Starting from scratch would be too costly and time-consuming for most small businesses.
4) Remove Geographic Limitations
One of the distinct values of the cloud and big data is it eliminates geographic boundaries for your business. Through the cloud, you can share information and connect with customers—anywhere, anytime—no matter where you are located. With data that tells you where you customers are and what products or services interest them regionally or even locally, you can target your marketing more precisely and uncover new opportunities to grow.

Want to buy pre-made gourmet meal kits?  You can order them online at numerous places.
Need an interior decorator to give you advice but can’t find one in your local area?  You can get e-design services handled electronically at a distance.
Like to learn guitar in the comfort of your own home? You can take music lessons via Skype.
For those in the knowledge industry, i.e., those who produce with their heads not their hands, selling online has opened up new revenue streams and new opportunities.
But if you’re a knowledge worker what can you sell besides your time?
Easy: package up your knowledge and sell it in digital form.
Knowledge workers such as consultants, accountants, engineers and other professionals are figuring out how to package up their knowledge and know how into digital goods such as ebooks, interactive training courses, video coaching sessions, software and more.
Here are three benefits of selling digital goods:
CONVENIENCE
Selling your goods digitally is just convenient by today’s standards — both for you and for the customer.
There’s nothing to be shipped or delivered via the mail or packages.  It’s fast, too. Everything is simply delivered online or through email, and delivery is usually immediate.
LOWER MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS COSTS
Digital goods are created and delivered electronically, usually through a download button or email.  Since you’re moving 1’s and 0’s around, instead of items packed in styrofoam peanuts and cardboard boxes, the costs can be dramatically lower.  Manufacturing your goods may consist of nothing more than writing an ebook, saving it as a PDF, and loading it online.
MARKETING ADVANTAGES
Selling digital goods also has a built-in advantage: your product becomes part of your marketing loop. Given the way the Web works, when you’re selling your digital items you’re also marketing your business.  The product is not only something you earn from, it helps you market your business to other customers.  
Customers are searching on their phones and other electronic devices for what they’re looking for. A whole slew of results will pop up instantaneously. If you’re a small business owner, you’re going to want to be a part of the pack. Your online presence will end up attracting more site traffic, just by the simple fact that you are more accessible to Web users.
The more visible you and your digital products are online, then over time:
(1) the more likely you will gain higher search engine position,
(2) the more people will share links to your products on social media, and
(3) the more they will discuss you online — thus generating more traffic.
And by generating traffic, you will likely be making more sales.
Being digital will allow shoppers to easily find your company among competitors, and see what benefits you offer. We sometimes think of it as a disadvantage to be seen among competitors, but consider this.  If a buyer were standing in a competitor’s brick and mortar business, it would be much harder for him or her to even know you exist or that you have more to offer.  But online it might be just a matter of a couple of clicks to discover that. Or seeing a reference to your company on social media.
And if you’re selling knowledge and know how, you tend not to be a commodity that is easily replaceable or pales by comparison. Instead you are unique. You have the chance for your uniqueness to be discovered more readily online.
By taking advantage of the Web and the easy transfer of knowledge to buyers, you are staying relevant and on their radar. The more you appear, the more relevant you become to the customer. When it comes time to make a purchase again, a customer will have you right where they want you.

Here are two: they stand on a firm foundation of strong operations and reported financials. Success in business is measured in one language only: numbers. Whether it’s guest or patient count, cars sold or tuned up, pets groomed, cakes baked or flowers delivered, success in business is told in numbers. We may all sell different products and services, but we all speak the same language: numbers. Have I hammered enough on numbers yet?
1. Keep Score
Business strength shows up on the bottom line. How do you know if things are going well? You continuously keep score just like in sports. Can you imagine a football game where there were no points, timing, penalties or quarters? The numbers tell the coach and players where they are at any given time to help determine the winning strategy.
The same is true in your business: When you keep score, with daily sales, taxation, comps, payment media (credit cards; cash; gift cards) and sales person reports, you can immediately see what needs adjusting and what can be leveraged for the largest gain.
Keep in mind anything measured improves – but – go one step beyond to get to the real magic: Anything measured – and reported – improves even faster! In your business, reporting your numbers helps them get better. Does the coach sit by himself at half time? NO! He gathers the team, they all review the numbers and agree on a plan to move forward. It’s one thing to KNOW, it’s another to DO, so, now take action. While reporting numbers is critical, execution trumps knowledge. Take immediate action to improve your business.
2. Systems & Set Asides
Today, far too many independent business owners still use the shoebox, grocery bag and online check register method of financial management. I see it all the time and it makes my stomach turn. Get – and keep – your financial systems in order.
How can you see the scoreboard if it’s in a paper grocery bag? Whatever system you’re using, use it daily and set aside what your operating plan including a budget (I know I just said the “B” word) says you need to meet your obligations weeks and months down the road.  Cash forecasting includes those pesky things like replacing equipment, paying payroll or contractors, leases and loan payments. If you’re out of your league on this stuff, hire a professional and don’t look back.
My businesses soared when I made the shift from personal to professional financial management. The right professional pays for themselves!
3. Build A List What?
This isn’t a financial task – or is it? IT ABSOLUTELY IS!
There are many strategies to improve revenues (obviously, a financial function). I believe the single highest value activity you can do as a business owner is marketing – and building a list is the most important of the marketing tasks. I’m putting the list building in the financial category because I want you to understand the vast importance of it. When you’ve got a list of guests who have opted in to your list, you immediately go from annoying pest to welcome guest. You can then invite your members in more often, build a relationship with them and be the “go to” place when they are thinking of where to spend their money. Don’t delay on building a list. Without one, you’re just a dinosaur waiting to go extinct.

SMBs should have a solid understanding of the business tax landscape to help them keep more of the hard-earned income generated by their enterprises. 1-800Accountant offers up the following tax tips for SMBs to navigate through the tax code and take advantage of it in the end:
1) Understand your specific business tax structure.
Several types of entities are available on the business buffet line. Each business entity comes with a certain type of tax structure. For instance, simple sole proprietorships and partnerships are considered informal business entities. The business taxes levied on them pass through to their owners’ personal tax returns. The same goes for S corporations and LLCs taxed as S corps. On the other hand, C corporations and LLCs taxed as C corps are taxed directly at the business level.
2) Know your additional filing deadlines.
Handling business taxes is a different animal mainly because of the additional deadlines that are often involved when paying them. For example, March 15th is the corporate tax deadline, while May 15th is an annual filing deadline for owners of nonprofit corporations. In addition, quarterly tax payments are required for business owners who operate both formal and informal business structures. These fall on January 15th, April 15th, June 15th, and September 15th.
3) Take advantage of all eligible business tax deductions and credits.
While corporate taxes are viewed as more complicated by accountants, they do come with far more opportunities to save money via business tax deductions and credits unavailable to individuals. These tax-reducing options include the home office deduction, the vehicle deduction, deducting meals and entertainment, and medical expense write-offs. Certain tax credits are also available to self-employed entrepreneurs, such as credits for hiring specific employees and using energy-efficient items. Remember that many businesses can claim industry-specific deductions and credits, so be sure to know what you can write off in your own line of work.
4) Outsource your tax filings, bookkeeping, and payroll.
Business tax filings, maintaining bookkeeping records, and handling payroll are all very time-consuming processes. There are lots of IRS rules and regulations involved in them as well. So consider outsourcing these required business duties to others if you don’t employ your own bookkeeper or accounting professional on staff. You’ll be able to rest easy, knowing you are staying compliant, standing on solid financial ground with your business, and saving as much money as possible.
5) Maintain proper records of all business transactions.
To claim tax write-offs and credits for which your small business is eligible, you must maintain proper business records. The IRS requires business owners to prove that the expenses they attempt to deduct are for business items and services – and not for personal use. This is why it is critical to keep an organized file of receipts and other relevant documents. It’s also wise to scan these records for security and convenience purposes. Along with receipts, keep copies of your business tax returns handy so that you can compare your income amounts and tax payments from year to year. Doing so can help you find more ways to reduce your taxes in the future and, in turn, increase your bottom line.

The result? Gallup estimates the U.S. economy loses nearly $370 billion each year due to employee disengagement.
Gamification — using game mechanics and reward structure to motivate employees — can be a great option for small businesses, because they can drive big results at a very low cost. Unlike traditional monetary reward structures, gamification uses status, access or power as rewards, and plays on our natural inclination toward competition. Here are a few high-profile success stories from a range of industries:
Target
Being a cashier can be monotonous and disconnected from feedback or rewards, easily leading to disengagement. Target has implemented a classic game for its cashiers: As the cashier scans items, a red or green light shows if the scan has been completed in the optimum time. At the end of the customer checkout, the cashier immediately sees their “score” showing how closely they kept to the optimum scan and checkout time. This game is effective because it is very simple (you’re either faster or slower than the ideal), it is closely tied to a single productivity goal (optimizing checkout time), and feedback is received immediately after performance.
Ford Motor Company
A sales and service staff that knows your product inside and out is an incredibly valuable asset. Ford Motor Company in Canada used gamification to amp up engagement in its online learning portals, helping sales and service teams learn the ins and outs of new car models, technologies and financing plans each year. Ford’s strategy turning testing into a game, with points and badges awarded and leaderboards prominently displayed. The program saw a 417% increase in use, as well as improvements in sales and customer satisfaction.
Salesforce
Knowing that half of all CRM implementations fail, Salesforce created a “Big Game Hunter” game to increase its user engagement and encourage more robust use of its CRM platform. Salespeople begin as “Chicken Hunters” and work toward “Big Game Hunter” status as they utilize more and more features of the Salesforce platform. The game worked — based on a Salesforce case study, customers reported that compliance with Salesforce best practices increased by as much as 40%.
Deloitte
Deloitte’s Leadership Academy wanted to increase engagement with their digital training program for senior executives around the globe. Implementing a game system, trainees now receive badges and points for the training modules they complete, with rankings and leaderboards pushing this highly competitive audience to complete courses faster than their peers. Deloitte’s own case study on the game noted that daily visits to the training site increased by 46% in just the first three months.
Props To You
One notable gamification app, Props To You, specifically addresses the issue of “gaming the system.” Instead of awarding badges based on single accomplishments, badges and status is based on trends, averages and personal bests. By rewarding consistent performance — and trends of improving performance — this game helps businesses encourage reliable, upward professional development.
Microsoft
Following the lead of its philanthropic leader, Microsoft created a productivity game called Communicate Hope. The game focused on increasing feedback and bug detection during the critical testing phase of new products, awarding points based on the quantity and quality of feedback submitted. But instead of awarding money or status, employees were able to convert their earned rewards to donations to local and national charities.
As you can see, the possibilities for gamification are diverse, and the potential significant. Most clearly, the best games fit closely with the unique goals of the business, provide near-instant feedback to employees, and spur the competitive nature in all of us. With a little creativity and a focus on particular productivity goals, you can develop your own game to enhance employee engagement and drive improved performance.

According to Northwestern University’s Center for Retail Management, more than half your business is coming from about 10-15% of customers — and marketing to this targeted, loyal audience is far cheaper than looking for new customers. So, it’s not surprising to hear that loyalty programs are dramatically boosting sales for businesses in every industry.
But beyond sales growth, here are a few surprising ways loyalty programs can grow your business:
1) Personal Connections with Customers
Great customer relationships are personal customer relationships, and they start with connecting a name to a face. Loyalty programs help your staff learn the names and faces of your most loyal customers, and progressively learn those customers’ preferences. That means better customer service and a transformative customer experience that sticks in customers’ minds, sets you apart, leads to free word-of-mouth marketing, and brings customers back again and again.
2) Short Feedback Loop for Finely Tuned Marketing
Traditional advertising has a long feedback loop. Many ad campaigns only pick up speed after numerous placements, as the ads get lodged in consumers’ minds and eventually drive action. Tracking the efficacy of a billboard advertisement, for example, can also be murky. Did a customer really come in because they saw the billboard? A loyalty program shortens and focuses that feedback loop. Customers’ behavior is tracked in real-time, and rewards or special offers can be limited with expiration dates. If customers come back, the promotion worked. If not, it didn’t. Either way, you’ll know immediately — and can hone your future marketing accordingly.
3) Bringing Back the Same Customers Brings In Greater Revenue
Here’s the math: Most businesses lost more than 20% of their customers each year. Considering that it costs 10 times as much to attract a new customer as to keep a current one, focusing on retention will actually grow your revenue.
4) Incentives Drive “Overspend” and Cross-Sell Opportunities
Incentives bring loyal customers back through your doors, and this alone is valuable. Just as consumers with a gift card tend to spend more than the card’s dollar amount, the incentives offered through a loyalty program drive so-called “overspend,” as customers look to make the most of their incentive by upgrading or adding additional products. Make sure your staff is taking advantage of these cross-sell opportunities to encourage overspend.
5) Instantly Adaptable Marketing
Along with the short feedback loop, loyalty programs give you a highly adaptable marketing tool. Need to clear out a type of product for an incoming shipment? Having a slow week? Placing traditional ads takes time — and the response lags significantly. By contrast, you can push a new offer through your loyalty program almost instantly.
As you explore the potential of your own loyalty program, you’re sure to discover many unexpected and hidden ways the program is helping your business grow. Don’t keep them to yourself — share these insights with other small business owners, and look to learn from your peers to make sure you’re getting the most from this valuable tool.

This may seem to […]…",15-04-2016,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/taking-the-work-out-of-finding-great-employees/,"The numbers don’t lie. Your chances of making a great hire is only about 50%. In an effort to push that number a bit higher, we’ve assembled seven great tips to help you identify the best possible candidates so you can hire the best possible employees.
 
1. Hire an outsider.
This may seem to go against common sense, but let’s take a look at the logic. When you hire someone with previous experience, you’re probably thinking that they know the business so you won’t have to train them. But the fact is, competitors’ leftovers are rarely superstars, and you might be unknowingly bringing their worst habits into the heart of your operations. But when you nab someone new to your industry, you can teach them how to sell in your business, the way you want them to, without preconceptions about customers.
 
2. The more, the merrier?
More people working more hours simply isn’t the answer. Here’s why. While it might make sense to employ lots of part-timers to maximize your flexibility, what you’re really doing is bringing on moving parts who are increasingly disengaged from your gameplan. When you have employees working 2 or 3 other jobs, they’ll probably be so frazzled that there’s very little chance they’ll have time to settle into your culture—let alone care about making an impact on your overall success.
 
3. Plays well with others.
It’s definitely great for applicants to have outside interests and hobbies. But most of the time, they are done online or solo. But, as you know, your business exists in the real world. So it’s important to ask questions that will reveal their interests and abilities relating to other human beings in the real world.
 
4. The past predicts the future.
Don’t get us wrong. We’re all for finding out what a potential employee wants to do with their future. But your immediate concern is in the here and now. And the best way to find that out is by asking interview questions about how the applicant will work in your business today. Be specific. When they can tell you specifics based on their past, they know what that desired behavior looks like and how to deliver it.
 
5. Sell them your company.
Not literally, of course. But don’t be afraid to talk about your history. Or how you view the environment you have created for your customers, what remarkable service looks like, or how you want customers to feel and your management style. Showing them your passion for what you’ve built helps them see how their personality will (or won’t) fit in with the company. Your sales pitch (and their reaction) can go a long way in finding a good match.
 
6. Don’t trust your gut.
Savvy job seekers know to tell you everything you want to hear about their abilities, successes and how they’ll put that to work for you. So, throw them a curve by finding something not to like about them. Ask something like, “I’m sure you can agree no one is perfect. Can you give me a time you didn’t give great customer service and how you handled it?” Great employees can pinpoint such a time (we’ve all had them) and tell you what they’d have done differently or how it was resolved. Poor employees will just tell you it never happened.
 
7. Think about it.
You’ve had that experience when you meet someone who just clicks. But, don’t hire on the spot! Have them call you back at 4pm the next day. That will give you time to call their references, see a few other candidates, and, most importantly, let them sweat a bit about whether or not you’ll hire them. Taking your time helps you keep your wits about you and maintain firm control as an employer.
 
In closing, never forget that people want to work with and for a great employer. So craft your questions accordingly. Help them see that you care just as much about finding the right fit as they do. Let them know that their success is your success, meaning you’ll give them more attention and train them to exceed customers’ expectations. That’s how you find great employees. And that’s how you grow your business.

Never happy with the status quo, we’ve been a nation of people who think “how could this be done better?…",29-04-2016,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/lafleurs-seafood-restaurant/,"If you think about it, historically, the defining characteristic of the United States and its people has been our entrepreneurial spirit. Throughout time, we’ve been a nation of explorers, hackers, tinkerers, do-it-yourselfers. Never happy with the status quo, we’ve been a nation of people who think “how could this be done better?”
Improving that which came before is as American as apple pie, and we’ve done it time and time again, especially in the world of cuisine. Sure, the Germans invented the hamburger, but we perfected it; burritos are a 19th century creation of Mexico, but it took American ingenuity to wrap up eggs, bacon, cheese, and hash browns in a tortilla to create the breakfast burrito. But one great American innovator gave us something so undoubtedly American, he should have his own holiday. 
That man was Herb Macdonald. His invention: the all-you-can-eat buffet. In the mid-1950s, the Las Vegas publicity and entertainment manager had the earth-shattering revelation that you could deliver an artful presentation of a restaurant’s entire menu and more, and people would come. They would eat. And they would be happy.
Sure, the Swedes created the smorgasbord, and Herb Macdonald improved it, offering our great nation the ability to pick, choose, and consume to our hearts’ desire for one all-inclusive price.
But I’d argue that there’s one more great innovator in the history of the buffet, and that’s the LaFleur family of Livingston Parish, LA. Their great contribution: to bring an all-you-can-eat buffet featuring the freshest seafood plucked daily from the Gulf of Mexico to the people of Baton Rouge and surrounding communities.
Thirty-eight years ago, the LaFleur family opened their LaFleur’s Seafood Restaurant in Denham Springs, just outside Baton Rouge, and since then, they’ve been serving fresh seafood to over three generations of families in the area, to rave reviews.
And while many businesses can, at times, become stale as they find success by doing one thing well, LaFleur’s has continued to innovate, most recently in 2013, with the adoption of a mobile loyalty platform, enabling them to communicate with, and reward, the loyal customers who show up every weekend for their lunch and dinner all-you-can-eat seafood buffets.
Ever since launching the Clover Rewards at their restaurant, LaFleur’s has awarded hundreds of their loyal buffet customers with free lunch and dinner buffets. The tiered system allows LaFleur’s to reward their most loyal customers by reducing the requirements to earn a free meal over time. And over the first ten months, the program’s been a great success, averaging about 20 new customers every week over the first six months, and even more weekly (nearly 30) since December. 
Having hundreds of engaged customers in a loyalty program is no small feat, but LeFleur’s 1800 rewards members is a real accomplishment, especially in a restaurant. Sure, coffee shops generally find great success with loyalty programs, as many people come in a couple times per week, but LaFleur’s has managed to do the same thing with their seafood buffet.
So how did they do it?
In chatting with LaFleur’s management, we learned that they’d tried the traditional punch card in the past, but found that often customers would forget the card at home, and they even had issue with a few bad apples trying to game the system by creating their own punches.
With the introduction of Clover Rewards, LaFleur’s has managed to reduce loyalty program fraud while improving customer service, enabling greater interaction with customers due to the ability to greet check-ins by name.
While the transition to Clover Rewards left some less technologically-inclined a little wary of having to use their phone, LaFleur’s implemented a couple of tactics to ensure the program went smoothly. 
First, they gave their staff extensive training in offering, encouraging, and setting up Clover Rewards for customers, and they motivated the staff by putting up a sign that read, “if your server doesn’t tell you about our rewards program, we’ll give you $10 off your meal.”
The family-like nature of the staff that LaFleur’s management team has cultivated over the years ensured their staff incorporated Clover Rewards into every transaction; nobody on the staff wanted to cost the restaurant money. With ample training and a little motivation that was more carrot than stick, LaFleur’s management was confident that their staff would go the extra mile in offering Clover Rewards and helping their customers get set up.
And the proof is in the (tasty bread) pudding*: to date, LaFleur’s has given nearly 11,000 punches to just over 1,800 customers in just over 4,200 visits–numbers any loyalty program could be proud of.
Where the future of the all-you-can-eat buffet goes, no one can tell for sure, but you can be sure that with their mobile loyalty program, LaFleur’s will continue to provide great customer service and reward their best customers time and time again.

Certainly, with the advent of the internet and the homogenization of urban culture in America, in just about any city beyond a couple hundred thousand people you’ll find at least one restaurant that serves up a nice vegetarian menu or a bakery that features a line of gluten free products, but what about the rest of the country?
Many of us who live in cities tend to forget that the vast majority of this country is rural, meaning that if you have special dietary needs or are looking for expanded options beyond fast food, greasy spoon diners, casual dining chains, or big-box grocery stores, often times you’re just plain out of luck.
It’s that need–the need for options–that lead business partners Diane and Jessica to open up Jake’s Coffee & Espresso several years ago. Located in rural Staunton, IL, about an hour northeast of St. Louis, Jake’s Coffee & Espresso provides something that isn’t provided anywhere else in the southern part of the state: a gluten free bakery, making it somewhat of a destination.
Jake’s Facebook page regularly fields questions from all sorts–travelers, touring cyclists, truck drivers–looking for gluten-free baked goods and quality coffee while traveling up and down Interstate 55 between Springfield and St. Louis. People will drive from several counties over just to pick up some of their famous gluten-free lemon poppyseed or carrot cake muffins, monster cookie cupcakes, or the Staunton favorite, the peanut butter cranberry granola bites.
Whether it’s the wide array of gluten-free baked goods, deli counter staples like their tuna salad panini, reuben sandwich, and a number of homemade soups, or their exotic latte menu that includes wild flavors like butter beer, island dream cupcake, and coconut macaroon–among many others, Jake’s always provides a staggering assortment of options, even when it comes to providing ways to engage with their loyalty program.
Jake’s started running their loyalty program with Clover Rewards in mid-November of last year, and in the nearly-five months that have passed since, they’ve created a highly-engaged group of core customers by doing something that few other merchants do: Jake’s uses every tool in the Clover tool belt to connect with and engage their customers.
For example, when Jake’s signed up with Clover Rewards, they knew that in order for the program to be a success, they’d have to get users to download the app. To do so, they utilized the “specials” functionality of Clover to create an electronic coupon that was shared to social media, offering users a free cup of coffee to simply open a rewards account. The special was a success, garnering 48 signups in the first 24 hour period that they offered the program.
Notice Jake’s offered the free cup of coffee just for a signup. The distinction here is that Jake’s is a frequent user of another of an often less-utilized functionalities–the text message account.
Prior to offering Clover Rewards, Jake’s already allowed their customers to text message in their morning coffee or pastry orders so that they’d be waiting piping hot the second the customer walked through the door. Given the fact that Jake’s customers were already texting the shop, it wasn’t much of an additional effort for them to further engage with the shop via Perka’s text-message accounts. Now, a fair number of Jake’s customers earn rewards using only SMS.
Since then, Jake’s has built a group of 150 highly engaged core-customers who have earned over 1500 punches in just over 1000 visits, meaning their average Clover Rewards customer has at least 10 punches and has been rewarded at least one free coffee drink.
So how did Jake’s do it? By utilizing another of Clover’s highly-valuable, yet generally under-utilized functionalities: the push notification.
Regardless of whether a Jake’s customer signed up for Clover Rewards via text message or by downloading the app, Jake’s stays top-of-mind with their most valuable customers by pushing out a “special of the day” push notification regularly. Between two and five times per week, Jake’s offers one of their exotic latte or mocha flavors for the special price of $2.50 via a short message that’s received by every one of their Perka customers.
The beauty of it is, regardless of whether the special flavor is the customer’s–pardon the pun–cup of tea, they’re still reminded that Jake’s is open and waiting to serve them a hot cup of joe, whatever their favorite flavor.
For Jake’s, the results of engaging with and rewarding their most valuable customers with Perka has been clear: more visits from their most valuable customers. Through a mix of a great menu, exceptional service, and a rewards program that’s flexible enough for any kind of customer, they’ve built a group of highly-engaged regulars that they can count on to visit the shop day in and out.

news_24,news,"Back from the Brink: Jay’s Steakhouse Rebuilds Its Reputation for Quality, Customer by Customer","Succeeding in the restaurant business is notoriously tough. Where are most likely to stumble - and, more importantly, how can you recover? This post shares how one restaurant brought itself successfully back from the brink.…",03-05-2016,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/back-from-the-brink-jays-steakhouse-rebuilds-its-reputation-for-quality-customer-by-customer/,"Jay Walters has a passion for food, a work-hard ethic, and an entrepreneurial spirit. So he did what thousands of plucky, independent-minded people do each year: “I stuck my neck out and went for it,” he said.
In 2013, Jay’s Steakhouse opened in picturesque Rifle, Colorado. Nestled between the Colorado River and the wild Roan Plateau, this cattle-ranching town gets travelers to and from Denver and attracts hiking and hunting enthusiasts alike.
Rifle may be small, but Jay felt the ingredients for restaurant success were there. The potential customer base is robust. Real estate is affordable, even in the historic downtown. And Jay knows hearty steaks and burgers never go out of style.
But like many new restaurant owners, he discovered that turning a passion into a successful operation is harder than it looks. For starters, the restaurant business is notoriously tough. Common estimates are that 60% don’t make it past the first year, and 80% go under in five years.
In our connected, competitive world, a stellar reputation is essential, too — and reputations are easy to tarnish. There’s no room for mistakes, even for novices climbing the learning curve.
For Jay’s team, that curve was steep. The cooks were inconsistent. The wait staff was inexperienced. And the restaurant’s POS crashed frequently, forcing harried employees to write tickets by hand and resort to old credit card swipers.
Service stumbles “spread like wildfire” in the small town, says Jay. Customers went public with their discontent on Yelp. At a low point, as the restaurant struggled to survive, Jay jumped into action. He took the helm as cook, hired a reliable team of servers and ditched his “terrible” POS.
In its place, he took a chance on Clover. The impact was swift and dramatic. Orders from the restaurant floor or outdoor patio were simply tapped into a Clover Mobile. The kitchen instantly received each order. Freed from racing back and forth, the wait staff was able to focus attention where it belonged: on customers.
Clover Mobiles have “truly built the business back because we’re hands-on with our customers,” says Jay. “I turned the place around in eight months with the help of everybody — and a good portion was with this Clover. It just made everything run easier and more efficiently.”
The restaurant’s manager, Crissi, recalls hours spent on paperwork, not people. “With the old system, I had to manually input credit card transactions, a month and a half worth of them.” Tasks such as this have been eliminated.
And you don’t have to be super tech-savvy to reap labor-saving benefits. Wait staff quickly get the hang of using Clover. As Crissi says, “I explain to employees that it‘s like a big smartphone.” And like a smartphone, she downloads only the apps she needs — Tables for orders and Time Clock by Homebase for employee payroll and scheduling.
By simplifying both the front and back of house, everyone has time and energy for the bigger picture: keeping customers happy with perfectly prepared food, delivered promptly and cheerfully — every time.
Opening a restaurant is never easy. But today’s diners have sky-high expectations, and they’re empowered like never before. While social media can get the message out about a business, negative word-of-mouth travels even faster, derailing dreams in the process.
For Jay and his team, those dreams are alive and growing. With business booming, Jay is scouting for new locations for a second branch. And he’s rekindled his original passion for cooking, which is what nudged him into the restaurant business in the first place.
“It’s a lot of hard work,” he says, “but I put my heart into every plate.”

news_26,news,How to Manage a Young Staff,"If your business runs on primarily part-time labor, you’ve likely got a lot of millennials on board. Do you know how to manage them effectively? This post shares 3 tips that have worked wonders for an outdoor adventure company.…",07-06-2016,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/how-to-manage-a-young-staff/,"More than one in three workers today is a millennial, according to Pew Research. That makes the millennial generation the largest in the U.S. workforce. Especially if your business runs on primarily part-time labor, you’ve likely got a lot of millennials on board. Do you know how to manage them effectively?
If retaining a young staff is an issue for your business, take a tip from a small business that’s doing it well. Glenwood Adventure Company is an outdoor activity company based in Colorado. They offer customers a wide range of activities, including hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, whitewater rafting, and more. In the past six years, they’ve expanded from a staff of 8 to a staff of 113, spread across four different locations around the state. Because the work is part-time and mostly seasonal, that spread-out, rapidly growing staff largely consists of young people between 16 and 30 years old.
How does Glenwood Adventure Company attract and retain this young staff? How does Ken Murphy, the company’s president, create an atmosphere that keeps these young workers coming back summer after summer? Here are three things Glenwood Adventure Company does to attract and retain a young staff:
1. They make it easy for workers to check and change their schedules on the go. 
Young workers, especially if they’re working part-time, are juggling a lot of priorities. They may have more than one job, or they may be in school. They definitely have friends and family they want to spend time with. Rather than struggling to make them work with a traditional scheduling system, why not be flexible from the start? Glenwood Adventure Company uses Time Clock by Homebase, which allows its workers to check their schedules, request changes, and even ask colleagues to switch shifts, all from their smartphones. That means Murphy doesn’t have to keep running around to his four different locations, posting and updating schedules. Better yet, scheduling data is automatically integrated into their Clover POS.
2. They offer plenty of growth opportunities. 
Murphy is keenly aware of the importance of growth opportunities to workers who are just beginning their careers. Of course, it helps that Glenwood Adventure Company is growing rapidly. Staff can easily start out guiding biking tours and then add new responsibilities. But Murphy has also made helping his staff grow a priority–some workers have advanced into management, gone back to school, or gotten certified as EMTs. These kinds of activities not only make them better, more dedicated staff today, they help prepare these young workers for their future careers. That’s the kind of opportunity that builds loyalty. “Luckily, I started with a wonderful…crew, and they’ve brought in friends,” Murphy says. “I think word got out that we were a good growing company to be involved with.” Considering that many of Glenwood’s customers are active young people, strong word-of-mouth is not only retaining their staff – it’s likely growing their customer base, too.
3. They’re open to new ideas. 
Murphy’s young staff is incredibly tech-savvy. “They know how to work the systems better than even I do now,” he says. They’re constantly finding new ways to streamline the company’s processes, or identifying new Clover apps that could be useful. Murphy is always happy to hear these new ideas. He’s humble enough to listen when a staff member comes to him with a suggestion, and flexible enough to be comfortable running a business that’s constantly evolving.
 
Numerous studies have shown that millennial workers like to be treated as individuals and given lots of opportunities to grow. They want to feel like they’re part of a team, not just a cog in a machine. Glenwood Adventure Company’s example shows some concrete ways that even very small businesses can create the kind of atmosphere that will attract and retain these young, energetic, ambitious workers.

news_27,news,5 reasons you need gift cards at your counter-service restaurant,"For nine years straight, gift cards have topped holiday wish lists, and virtually every American bought a gift card last year. This post shares 5 ways gift cards can help your small business grow.…",07-06-2016,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/give-the-people-what-they-want-gift-cards/,"For nine years straight, gift cards have topped holiday wish lists, according to the National Retail Federation’s Holiday Consumer Spending Survey. If that’s not testament to how much shoppers love gift cards, how about this? Each year, 93 percent of Americans buy or receive a gift card. So it really goes without saying that if you’re the proprietor of a quick-serve restaurant, like a coffee shop, deli, or frozen yogurt vendor, or a retail store, you want to make this hot seller available to your customers.
Husband and wife team Justin and Brie Henshaw, owners of Fuse Frozen Yogurt, have witnessed the importance of gift cards to their small business’s bottom line. Customers regularly hit up Fuse – which has locations on St. Simons Island and Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia – for their tasty froyo, gelato, sorbet, and soft serve fruit, but gift cards are extremely popular, too.
The Henshaws use Gyft to sell both physical and digital gift cards. Despite some minor bumps along the way (like the ability to purchase only one gift card per transaction), they’d recommend Gyft to other small business owners. Here’s why.
1. They’re attractive to Millennials.
For those who prefer to remain old-school, Gyft offers plastic cards. But for members of the 18- to 34-year-old crowd that want to keep their entire lives on their smartphone, Gyft also offers digital cards. Buyers can purchase digital gift cards in-store, online, or over the phone and have them sent directly to recipients’ phones. When it’s time to purchase, recipients just fire up the Gyft app and redeem the card value from there. No more wallets bulging with plastic cards, and you always know where your balance stands. There’s also the option of purchasing a physical card that the recipient can upload it to her phone.
2. They’re word-of-mouth advertising for your business.
Gift cards aren’t just an additional service to offer customers, they’re also an easy, low-cost way to build brand recognition. Someone may be unfamiliar with your business, but if he receives a gift card, it’s going to entice him into visiting. Gift cards “reconfirm our brand and give customers who wouldn’t have come, the chance to come and be a fan,” explains Justin. Gift cards also bring loyal customers back through the doors since they’re likely to include them on a holiday or birthday wish list.
3. Gift cards provide valuable information about customer buying habits.
As a small business owner, you won’t need to wonder if gift cards are one of your top sellers. Nor will you need to spend hours sorting through receipts to find out. Gyft sales data downloads directly into your Clover system, providing you details about your customers’ purchasing habits in just minutes — giving you the ability to adapt your marketing plans nimbly to reach your patrons more effectively.
4. They’re relatively trouble-free.
Ever experience a barista or clerk grumble when you ask to buy a gift card? Chances are, they’re ringing you up on a cumbersome, non-intuitive POS system. That won’t happen for merchants using Gyft (the app integrates with Clover’s API), which the Henshaws transitioned onto right before the busy Christmas season. Even better? Gyft’s customer service. “You call Matt right away, and you always get him on the phone, and he always takes care of things,” says Justin.
5. The economics of gift cards are great for merchants.
To an outsider, it may seem like swiping a gift card and swiping a credit card are the same thing. But when you’re a business owner, that same action has different costs associated with it. Both are convenient, but payment processing costs are cheaper for merchants when a customer pays with a gift card. Additionally, most consumers spend  20 percent more than the gift card’s face value, so this method of payment reaps more revenue for business owners. And since Gyft makes it easy for users to add value to (or “re-up”) a card once it’s been depleted (a key offering for coffee shops, ice cream parlors and the like), it’s likely that the sale of the original gift card will lead to more purchases from a single consumer.
 
As the Henshaws experienced first-hand, selling gift cards is an effective way to expand your business for little cost. “Having a gift card option allows us to reach new customers,” Brie says. “But it also brings loyal customers back in as well.”
Sounds like a gift worth giving to yourself.

But who they’re targeting might be. Contrary to popular belief, hackers don’t just go after “the big guys.” (According to one report, more than 70% of businesses breached had fewer than 100 employees.) Why? Because credit card information from small businesses is just as valuable — and often much easier to come by. After all, small businesses naturally lack the resources of bigger companies. But fear not. This post will help you identify a few of your most immediate threats and the best ways to fix them, so you can protect your critical credit card data and keep your business and customers safe.
As a general rule, the more types of payments you accept, the more vulnerable you are. (Think about it like a house — the more doors you have into it, the higher the likelihood you’ll leave one unlocked.) Mobile and online payments are on the rise, but the first place you should start is with your POS system. You need to consider two aspects: vetting the types of cards you’re accepting and taking a look at the physical POS system itself.
As we mentioned in another post,  being PCI- and EMV-compliant is an absolute must for any small business because it means you’re no longer held responsible for fraudulent transactions. It also adds extra layers of protection for you and your customers. And becoming compliant is easier than ever. It’s as simple as upgrading your POS system.
Ah, yes. The POS system. Bane of existence for retailers everywhere. But it doesn’t have to be that way. With Clover, you get options that allow you to work the way you want while enjoying industry-leading security on every device and transaction. Yes, really. Having a modern, secure POS system also helps with your brand reputation management since customers generally refuse to do repeat business with anyone has leaked their data. Once gone, trust is really hard to earn back.
The final consideration is having a plan in place should you ever find your security has been breached. It allows you to respond much faster and more efficiently — and can save you up to 15% in additional costs associated with a data breach. You know the old saying: failing to plan is planning to fail.
As always, Clover is here to answer any questions or provide additional insight into any of the information provided. Security is just one of the ways we help you get paid, sell more and run your business better!

It’s almost second nature for them to hold a device in their hands at all times. We call these people digital natives. And no matter the platform, from smartphones and tablets to laptops and smart TVs — even the Xbox and Playstation — they’re using the Internet to inform purchases from wherever and whenever.
At the same time, more information than ever before is available online. For businesses, this can be both good and bad. It means more opportunities to reach potential customers. But it also means that once you reach them, you’re expected to stay in touch. In essence, this has leveled the playing field for businesses. Size of media budget has become irrelevant.
What’s it all mean for you? With the prevalence of user-generated content sites like Yelp, City Search, Urbanspoon, as well as social media, businesses of every size are now able to fight for the same customers. In today’s highly-networked world, a great reputation trumps flashy marketing or big spends — especially at the local level.
Here then are 5 things to consider when catering to digital natives:
1. Interaction matters. One of the most important parts of standing out in a sea of small businesses is making sure customers know you care. Tech-savvy customers need to know you’re listening to what they have to say. In today’s always-on world, a well-tended digital presence is the best way to accomplish this. So, when customers post on your Facebook page, reply to their comments as soon as you can. Be active on Twitter, engaging with influential young people in your community. Elicit feedback whenever you can. And, most importantly, if you’ve failed in some way, apologize. Putting a human spin on your brand’s online presence will show that you understand your customers’ needs.
2. No do-overs for first impressions. The age-old adage about second chances and first impressions is still true today. Options abound for digital natives. That means if your website isn’t current, or your phone number isn’t easy to find, or your business isn’t listed on Google Maps, you’re probably going to be passed by before they even have a chance to learn about your business. Online is your first touch-point with digital natives, so make sure it’s a good experience.
3. Keep the experience going. Because comparison shopping is so easy, digital natives are constantly on the lookout for new ideas, products, and services to try. That said, the best way to keep customers once you’ve made that first impression is by creating a special experience for them. Offering a loyalty program is a great way to do this: by running daily specials, contests, or VIP-only events for repeated purchase behavior, your business can stand out from the crowd in the digital native’s mind. Sure, they’ll search for the nearest coffee shop, but all other factors being the same, they’ll always choose the one that remembers their name and finds a way to say “thanks for doing business here.” 
4. Make sure there are multiple ways to get in touch. Digital natives are savvy, and they’re persistent. More than ever before, customers are using multiple methods or “channels” of communication. From iPad apps, to a website, to a Facebook page, to a phone call, clients expect to be able to reach you. Keeping your (and their) options open is one of the best things your business can do. Being easy to reach is a great place to start.
5. Keep it simple. If this sounds complicated, don’t panic. The basic ideas about how to connect with natives are straightforward. If your business is easy to reach, interesting, flexible, and personable, you already have most other places beat! The main ideas here are pretty easy; the exact execution is up to you — don’t be afraid to experiment. Once you find something that works, be consistent and devote some resources to maintaining each of these ideas. Each will go a long way in helping you to build a steady core group of digital native customers.

Saddled with too many irons in the fire and not enough time to get everything done, their only choice is to…hire a manager. Scary? Yes. Painful? Not at all. When your business is your baby, you always want to do all you can to make it run as smoothly as possible. And sometimes, that means letting go of some of the small things and letting someone else take control. Here’s how to ensure that the manager you bring in will not only adhere to your company culture but even take it to a new level.
Define Expectations
When you were in charge, there was never a need to document your processes or convey your ideas about company culture. After all, it was just you. But once you hire someone else to take over, they need to know exactly what you want in terms of how they handle management responsibilities. So, start writing. If it’s important to you and how you want things done, you need to get it down on paper. Management philosophy. Approach to managing your team. Everything you do, really. From creating the weekly schedule to handling social media updates, if it’s part of your daily routine, it needs to be relayed to your new manager.
Divide and Conquer
It’s only natural for you to want to keep doing some of the managerial tasks rather than giving them all to the new hire. For example, if you really enjoy managing your social media, keep doing it. Just make sure you assign enough to the new manager so that you have time to focus on what you need to work on.
Speaking of what you need to work on: do you know where you need to put your attention once you’ve got your new hire in place? Think strategically: work on developing tactics to boost sales, find ways to grow your business, and research opportunities to elevate your brand.
Start Close By
Once you’re actually ready to hire, start looking close by. Check your existing network, both in real life and online, to see if anyone knows a good candidate for the managerial role. If that doesn’t net qualified candidates, expand your search. Check industry groups in your area or industry-specific job boards. As a last resort you can post your job on general job boards like Monster or CareerBuilder, but be prepared for a flood of resumes, most of which won’t be qualified.
When the time comes to choose, interview your top three picks. And, in the end, go with your gut. You want a manager with a similar philosophy to yours, who is a self-starter, and can take the worry and work off of your hands.
Once your manager is operating smoothly, take a deep breath and relax. Let them do their job so you can do yours — working on your business instead of working in it.

But it’s not just a dream. In fact, it’s easier than you think to make a part of your reality.
The truth is, all of us can sell. (Yes, even you.) And even though selling comes a bit more naturally to some, identifying your employee’s personality styles allows you to tap in to their innate abilities and help them sell more.
Once you understand the four personality styles, you can train your employees to connect with customers quicker and more effectively.
1.  The Driver. Think Gordon Ramsay. They’re all about being the best, smartest and known as a decision maker. The downside is they can be seen as inflexible and always trying to close.
If your employee is predominantly a Driver, their number one goal is to get something finished. You need to help them round off those gruff edges and reduce the chance they can come off as arrogant.
2.  The Analytical is like Spock on Star Trek: logical with a detailed system to process information. Their Achilles’ heel is that they can come off cold and uncaring. Surgeons, CPAs and many craftspeople are usually an Analytical personality.
If your employee is predominantly an Analytical personality, you need to train with a clear system of A to B to C so engaging a customer isn’t scary and makes sense. Be prepared to answer each of their many questions.
3.  The Expressive is like the character Jack in the movie Titanic: unafraid to try a lot of things, easily bored and full of unbridled enthusiasm. Unfortunately, they’re also the least likely to be found in retail these days. Why? Because on a beautiful day they’ll probably call in sick.
If your employee is predominantly an Expressive personality type, you want to harness their need for fun. You want to try avoid training them like an Analytical and raining on their parade. Use their easily distracted interests and enthusiasm for new products and processes as a sparkplug for the rest of your crew.
4.  The Amiable is by far the most common personality you’ll find in stores. They possess a desire to be liked and are naturally inquisitive about others without sharing many details of their own lives. The downside is they don’t stand out or demand anything and it takes a lot to get them riled so you never know when they might be hitting their breaking point.
If your employee is predominantly an Amiable, they’ll want to get along with no conflict. Teaching them how the other three personalities operate can show them how to avoid frustration and conflict. Because they are the least likely to be natural born salespeople and most afraid of engaging strangers, patience is a must.
****
Once you’ve identified each employee’s personality style, you’ll want to tailor your training to that style. Watch this space for part 2 of this series, with do’s and don’ts for getting through each personality type.

And one of the biggest downsides? Needing to raise prices on occasion.
Sure, customers dread price hikes. But small business owners really fear them because they worry that upping rates will drive away business. While it’s possible that you will lose a few diners or shoppers, boosting prices isn’t a business killer. In fact, when handled properly, price increases can actually help you build a strong, better, more trusting relationship with your customers.
Follow these tips and watch your profitability increase.
Be honest.
Maybe you’re raising your prices because you’ve increased your expertise and now your services are worth more. Perhaps your industry has experienced a boost in demand and there isn’t enough supply to meet it. Or it’s simply quite likely that your expenses are rising, and you need to match that rate in order to stay afloat. Explaining the increase to your customers demonstrates transparency and respect for their business. It’s likely that they’ll understand and continue to patronize your establishment.
Bundle it.
Package two or more products or services together enables you to enact fair price increases on all the components while also giving customers a better deal. When bundling, be sure to sell each part individually as well. A study from Carnegie Mellon University found that shoppers are receptive to bundling when it’s offered alongside a la carte options. 
Change the deal, but don’t eliminate it.
Many small businesses offer shoppers loyalty programs for buying in bulk or making frequent purchases. Small tweaks to these allow you to up how much you charge while still providing the client with the feeling of getting a discount. So the next time you need to raise prices, switch things up. Instead of offering “buy 3, get one free,” change it to “buy 5, get one free.”
Play up the value.
Consumers are willing to part with their hard-earned cash when they know they’re getting something that’s truly worth the cost. Emphasize an item’s quality or explain how the services you provide differ from your competitors. And of course, it’s always a good idea to over-deliver or improve your offering (with a new feature or complimentary add-on) to make the higher price even more palatable.
Give advanced warning.
Customers like surprises, but not when they require the shelling out of additional cash. If you plan to raise prices at your salon, for instance, tell your clients well in advance (think: three months ahead). They’ll appreciate you giving them the opportunity to take advantage of their favorite services now before costs increase.
Create new selections.
Just about all customers take price into consideration — but it usually isn’t the sole reason why they hit up your bakery for, say, fresh blueberry scones. When nudging the price upward, continue selling your regular varieties, but introduce a “special” (like blueberry lemon poppy seed) and sell for the same price as the others. This makes it apparent that you’re improving your offerings instead of just making people pay more for the same item they used to get for less.
Sell a more affordable version.
The next time you need to increase your prices, add a cheaper option to your menu. Doing so keeps loyal patrons that are extremely price-conscientious satisfied, while also attracting new ones who previously never considered purchasing the higher-costing item or service, as well.
Happy customers = happy business owners.

It pays to get to know your customers. Who are your most profitable customers? What triggers a sale? Which factors inspire customer loyalty and repeat business? It’s actually much easier – and more affordable – to answer these questions than most merchants realize. And better customer data can improve your marketing efforts tremendously.
Here are 9 creative ideas for building customer relationships that will really pay off.
1. Ask them questions.
This may seem obvious, but even asking a question while you ring them up can glean important information. Comments cards, polls, or surveys are easy ways to ask key questions such as: How did you hear about us? What made you decide to buy today? Was there something you were looking for that you couldn’t find? Would you refer a friend?
2. Offer free advice. 
All customers are looking for a solution to a problem; help them with their problems and you’ll start to build trust and credibility. If you own a clothing boutique, offer consultations specializing in finding clothes that will flatter their specific body type. Own a sweets shop? Label the candy bins to highlight treats that satisfy a craving while staying within your diet. These conversations offer incredible insight into your customers’ problems, why they buy particular products, and more. It’s also a powerful way to build rapport and nurture profitable relationships.
3. Host a contest or event.
Large organizations pay big money to get access to focus groups. You can do the same thing with very little money. Once you know who your target customer is, encourage a crowd of them to come to your store and figure out what they want. Host a fun contest for a new product idea, or create an event like a fashion show or charity drive that targets your key demographic. When they come in, engage them. Find out whether there are things you can easily do to add value or improve the customer experience so they are likely to return. Would offering free refreshments while they shop encourage them to stay longer? Are there additional services or products they are more apt to buy if you offered them? Once you get them in the door you can ask these crucial questions.
4. Check your data. 
A smart POS system like Clover can help you easily figure out what your best-selling products are, which ones bring you the most return, and how your business is performing on any given day. But did you know Clover can also help you figure out if a particular employee sells more than others? Our free Reporting app (see screenshot below) shows you who sold more and who garnered the largest tips, so you know exactly who are your star employees. Consider having those stars train the rest of the staff in customer service and how to cross-sell.













Explore all variables that influence buying behaviors—from changes in the weather to price fluctuations, and adjust your marketing to take advantage of opportunities. Take a closer look at your data—you might be surprised at what’s really driving sales.
5.   Use apps. 
Clover Insights is a great app for Clover customers offering data on customer buying trends, local competitors, and more. It lets you compare your business to aggregated data of  similar businesses in your area to see how you’re faring comparatively. Find out how much other businesses around you are making at any given moment and how many clients they’re serving. If the competition is successful, go on a secret-shopper mission and check out what they’re doing. It can give you actionable information like pricing and special offers that work or partnerships that are profitable.
6.    Determine influencers and what drives them. 
Influencers are people in a position to convince customers to buy from you. It could be a reviewer on Yelp! or the head of a local group. But it could also be a teenager who tends to travel with a squad of friends, or a nearby business that needs catering for large meetings. Finding your influencers doesn’t have to be time-consuming or difficult. Check out your bigger purchasers on social media and see if any of them have big followings. Often it’s just a matter of keeping your eyes and ears open for likely influencers: when a customer mentions in passing that they handle catering for their company. Figure out what your influencers like and you’re likely to get more sales overall.
7.    Build a customer loyalty program. 
Loyalty programs are not just a device to encourage repeat business. Once your loyalty program is up and running, you’ll be able to test offers to see what gets the best results and gather information on your best customers. Clover Rewards is a free app that’ll get your loyalty program started right.
8.   Watch your online activity.
If you have a website, take a close look at your most popular pages. What queries on Google bring people to your site? Are they downloading coupons, looking at reviews, or checking out product information? This data and the path customers take on your site can tell you a lot about your customer’s consideration process.
9. Crowdsource. 
Look up your main product on Google, Ask.com, Quora and similar websites. Find out what kinds of questions people are asking about it. For example, if you sell food, do they want to know if it’s gluten-free? Are they asking how many calories a portion is? Is one kind of food more heart-healthy than something else? Knowing the concerns people have about your products helps you create savvy marketing that resonates with customers.
Then look up what people are saying about your business on social media and review sites like Yelp! Are people talking about the seating, or how fast the service is? Are they looking for a place they can watch the game, or perhaps they need wifi. Monitoring comments on these free sites will tell you a lot about customer expectations.

Even the smallest distraction can throw your whole day off. That’s why the goal is to ensure each and every transaction goes smoothly and customers are able to get in and out of your business without a hitch.
So, how can you keep things flowing smoothly through your store? One simple way is with in-store signage. Done correctly, in-store signage guides and informs your customers so they can, ideally, complete their transaction without having to ask a single question.
Here are 3 things to consider when creating perfect in-store signage:
1.     How it looks. 
No matter what business you’re in, your goal is to offer the highest quality product or service. Your signage should reflect that same goal. Not only should it telegraph high quality, it should also be a natural extension of your brand. So, if you own a business that has a crafty and relaxed atmosphere, then look into creating a beautiful chalk board style sign. Or if your business is more upscale, create a sign consistent with that aesthetic, with clean lines and modern, simple design.
2.     What it says.
A great-looking sign with impossible-to-read text doesn’t do anyone any good. The text on your sign should be legible at a distance of 10+ feet. To this end, avoid whimsical, fancy fonts for the bulk of your copy.
Most importantly, be concise. Keep your text large and simple, direct the reader by using second-person words like “you” and “your,” and remember to include a call to action.
3.     Where it lives. 
In short, where it resides is just as important as what it says. With that in mind, if you’re constantly receiving questions like “where’s your restroom?” or “where do I order?” or “what are today’s flavors?” then your in-store signage isn’t doing its job. When placing a sign in-store, you want to make sure your sign is visible in every area from which it might be addressed.
For example, in your ice cream shop, make sure your restroom sign is visible from the front door, the seating area, the register, and more. For a quick-serve restaurant, make sure your coffee and dessert menu is visible from your dining area so if a customer changes their mind post-meal, they can make a decision from their seat.
Secondly, it’s also important that you place signage directing your customers as soon as they enter your establishment. A confusing experience can be the impetus for that scathing review in the local paper or on Yelp. If you want them to sit down first, or order first, or wait to be seated, make sure they are told with signage.
In summary, be concise, be thoughtful about fonts and placement, make sure the style matches your store’s branding and look, and make sure what you say is appropriate for the audience.
And one last piece of advice: have fun. Great signage can make or break a store’s experience. Don’t be afraid to let the creative juices flow. You can even seek the expertise of a hired gun if you choose. Whatever path you take, make sure it’s your best shot. Your customers will appreciate it.

Any retail store owner or coffee shop entrepreneur has had the importance of location dinned into them. But how much have you really heeded this message?
Smaller chains and franchises need to consider location even more than the “big guys”. For every Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts opening clusters of stores to dominate a market, you might only have one. What’s more, when you’re the only ones in a new area, there were no economies of scale — no shared distribution, no marketing overlap, and worst of all, no brand recognition.
All of this has taught successful entrepreneurs one lesson in selecting a location for your small business: pay more than you think you should. That’s it.
Being 100 feet away from traffic is a million miles from success.
Consider this example: a franchisee wants to put their shop around the back of a large shopping center with zero visibility and no chance for foot traffic. “I’ll save a bundle in rent,” he thinks.
Not really. Any savings gained from a sub-par location would’ve been given back threefold in marketing discounts to try to incentivize visitors.
“But Starbucks has a line out the door across the street,” he might counter.
Sorry, you aren’t Starbucks. They’re synonymous with coffee. And their branding is everywhere — if there’s a location across the street, you can bet customers can easily see their logo from most any spot at this intersection.
A lot of smaller businesses stumble when it comes to selecting the perfect location. The key to success? Looking at it like a customer — How do I enter the shopping center? How do I get out? Is this on the way to the freeway? What’s parking look like? All of those are good questions to ask before you sign a lease.
But take heart: even big-box stores struggle to find the perfect location and occasionally misfire. Let’s consider Target Canada’s recent decision to close 130 locations. What can businesses looking to expand learn from their mistakes?
1. Too many stores too quickly. Because Canadians shopped heavily at US Targets, Canada Target assumed Canadians would be drawn to the brand name. Target Canada went big several years ago by opening 130 locations – which they later decided to shutter. If they had just opened a handful of stores and then listened to customer feedback, they could have made crucial changes quickly to deliver on the Target brand promise. Operational issues are hard to fix once you’re open. You must study your potential customer first and foremost before opening. ‘Build it and they will come’ simply doesn’t hold up.
2. Location, Location, Location. Target couldn’t change the aging sites they had chosen fast enough. That’s why retailers often can get deals on older locations that may not be as convenient or visible as newer spaces. Either way, starting out in a weak location is not a good way to start. You never want to be 100 feet from success; pay more money for the best site.
Final Thoughts
Opening additional locations can be a smart way to grow your business. Just make sure you look before you leap. Plan, assess and ensure you have demand in the new area first.
And finally, before you open that new location, make sure you train new employees in your existing culture. Consistent experience is critical to ensuring continuity from location to location.

But as wonderful as it can be to see positive comments coming in, the opposite can be crushing. You know reviews matter to your business. As an entrepreneur, you didn’t get to where you are by sitting around and waiting for things to happen. You want to take action. But what should you do? What can you do that won’t make things worse?
Here are six steps to handling a bad review of your business:
1. DETERMINE THE REVIEW’S ACCURACY.
Talk to your staff—calmly—and find out if they remember this customer and the problems they’re describing. Keep in mind that there are two sides to every story, and the customer is entitled to their side. This customer may be a huge jerk. But while that might make the review unfair, it doesn’t necessarily make it inaccurate. Focus on the facts.
If the customer’s statements are factually incorrect or defamatory, you may be able to get the review taken down if it’s posted on Yelp or somewhere else with a policy that allows business owners to dispute negative reviews. But don’t hold out too much hope on this—social media sites are built to encourage people to speak their minds.
2. KEEP YOUR COOL.
Let’s assume the review is nasty, but it’s not technically inaccurate. The worst thing you can do is get angry or defensive. Going online and ranting about how rude and entitled the customer is may be satisfying in the moment, but you’re probably just going to end up making yourself look like the jerk.
3. USE YOUR NORMAL CUSTOMER SERVICE POLICY WHEN YOU RESPOND.
What would you do if a customer came to you with a complaint in person? You’d probably apologize and ask them what you could do to make things right. You’d comp their purchases, offer them a discount or a coupon for a future visit, give them dessert on the house, or whatever it took to get back in their good graces.
That’s exactly what you should do here. Comment publicly on the review with a polite apology and then follow up in private to apologize again and offer restitution. Research shows that about a third of customers who get a reply to a negative review will delete their original negative review, and about a third will post a new, positive review. You still have a chance to turn this person into a happy, loyal customer. Take it.
4. MAKE CHANGES IF YOU NEED TO.
Evaluate the situation calmly, after you’ve had a chance to cool off. Was this person just having a bad day, or is there a real problem here that needs to be addressed? Maybe you’ve got someone on staff who’s rude or unhelpful. Maybe you’re understaffed on Saturday nights. Maybe your back-end systems are overly complicated and slowing your staff down. Now is the time to fix any problems, so you don’t get another bad review tomorrow.
5. STOP FUTURE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY START.
Speaking of preventing future problems, if you don’t already have a plan for how your staff should handle difficult customer interactions, now’s the time to make one. Is your staff empowered to offer creative solutions to customer problems? Should they call a manager as soon as a customer looks unhappy? Make sure the entire staff knows what to do if things start to head south.
Think about setting up a way for customers to complain in a private forum before they escalate to a public review. Set out feedback cards, or let customers know how they can contact you directly. The Clover Rewards app includes a private feedback feature. If customers know they have a way to let you know how they feel, they may not feel the need to air their grievances publicly.
6. GET SOME GOOD NEWS OUT THERE.
The best way to combat a negative review is to drown it out with a chorus of positive comments. Make sure your satisfied customers know that you’d love for them to review you online. You can post signs or notices encouraging customers to review you on Yelp, Foursquare, Facebook, and wherever else you’re building a presence. If you’re doing a good job with your customer service, most of these reviews will be positive.
With your most loyal customers, you can be even more direct. Let them know that positive reviews help your business and ask them if they’ll take a few minutes to support you by posting a review online. Under no circumstances should you post reviews yourself, or get friends to post reviews under fake names—it’ll be obvious, and you’ll look like an idiot—but a genuine review from a real customer who wants to see you succeed will go a long way towards changing the conversation online.

It takes a lot of hard work and courage to take that leap and go from earning a steady paycheck to hustling for every dollar you bring in. Sure, the rewards can be enormous: the ability to set your own schedule, call all the shots, and create something that’s truly yours. But the risks are pretty big, too.
Here are 13 questions to ask–and answer–before you start your new business:
 
THE BUSINESS PLAN
1. Will I make money?
Start your planning process by doing what’s called a break-even analysis. Yes, there is math on this exam! In a break-even analysis, you calculate your fixed costs–your overhead, including rent, utilities, insurance, and so on–and your cost per sale. That’s whatever it costs you to make each item you’re selling. Then you calculate your average profit per sale, and see how many sales you need to break even. Is that number realistic? How long do you think it will take to get there?
2. How much will I charge?
Take another look at that break-even analysis. What prices are you planning to charge? How thin is your profit margin? Can you afford to offer discounts to bring in new customers? For how long? Discounts can be a great marketing tool, but be careful that you don’t get customers too used to a price that’s lower than you can actually afford.
3. Who’s my competition?
Think local–and national and global. Can what you’re selling be bought on Amazon? How will you set yourself apart from big chains? How will your bakery be different than that bakery down the street that’s always packed in the mornings?
4. Who is my customer?
It’s tempting to say “everyone,” but actually, the more specific your answer to this question is, the better. If your customer is “parents of elementary-school-aged kids who don’t have a lot of time to pack lunch in the morning”, then you’re already halfway to a marketing plan. Get as specific as you can. You can always broaden to new markets later.
 
THE PERSONAL PLAN
5. How will I feel working on this business for 80-plus hours a week?
Starting a new business takes a lot of work. You can expect to be working long hours for a couple of years, at least. Are you ready to make that commitment? And don’t forget all the paperwork, marketing, invoicing, and so on that will need to be done. You won’t be able to spend all your time on the part of the business that you love.
6. Can I really work with my partner?
If you’re considering going into business with someone else, now is the time to ask all the uncomfortable questions. You will be legally bound to this person–their credit score and financial responsibility will affect your livelihood. And you’ll be working those long hours with them. Now is the time to admit it if you think they might hold you back or drive you crazy.
7. Am I financially ready for this?
Take a hard look at your personal budget. What are your bare-bones expenses? How close to the bone are you comfortable cutting, and for how long? How is your credit score? Will you be able to get a loan if you need one? Do you have enough money saved up to get through the first few months as you get this business on its feet?
8. What’s my endgame?
Start thinking now about what your ultimate goal is for this business. That will influence the way you decide to set it up legally, and how quickly you try to expand. Are you dreaming of leaving this restaurant as a legacy for your kids? Do you want to sell this software company to a big tech firm? If you don’t know where you’re going, you won’t get there.
 
THE LEGAL STUFF
9. What am I going to call my business?
Are you going to do business under your own name? For a lot of service providers, that’s fine. But even if you want to call yourself something as simple as “Jane Smith Accounting”, you may need to register a “doing business as”, or DBA name. And if you want to create a new business name, you’ll need to check that it’s not already trademarked by somebody else.
10. Do I need a license?
Depending on what type of business you’re starting, you may need federal or state licenses or permits in order to operate legally. The Small Business Administration has the information you need.
11. What are my tax obligations?
If you’ve spent most of your career working as an employee who gets a regular paycheck with taxes withheld, your life is about to get a lot more complicated. Again, the SBA can help you figure out what state and local taxes you need to pay–but now’s the time to find accounting and legal professionals who can help you make sure you’re not missing anything.
12. Am I going to hire employees?
Obviously, hiring people comes with a whole host of other obligations. You’ll need to get an Employer Identification Number from the IRS, figure out how to withhold taxes from your employees’ paychecks, make sure they’re legally allowed to work, and more. You can start learning about what’s required online, but you may need legal advice. Payroll companies can help you streamline this burden, too.
 
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION
13. What will I do if I fail?
Starting a new business is a big risk. What’s your Plan B? Are you emotionally and financially prepared for this business to struggle for a while? If your business fails, will you end up with assets you can sell? What happens if you lose the money you’ve invested in this venture? Will you end up with a loan you can’t repay or a debt to friends and family that will keep you up nights?
You wouldn’t be considering starting a business if you didn’t have big dreams and the drive to make them come true. But it’s a good idea to pause for a reality check before you actually start trying to make this work. If you know you can survive failure, you’ll be that much more confident to go out there and strive for success.

How do you improve your customers’ lives? What keeps you going?
When you have answers, and use that knowledge to shape your communications, customers are more likely to listen.
Why? With more than 40 million active small business pages on Facebook, overwhelmed viewers are tuning out branded content. To reach them, you need to connect on a personal level.
A compelling brand story forges that connection. It shapes your identity, your customer service, your marketing efforts — every aspect of the business. Try these proven strategies to get on customers’ radars:
1. Have something to say.
People want to know why they should do business with you. That’s why you need to clearly define your brand DNA — who you are, what you believe, why you do what you do, and what words help you tell that story.
Nick Westergaard, a small business marketing expert, says it starts with a promise: “To build a brand, we must make a solemn promise to those we serve. If the paying customers aren’t at the end of what we’re doing, then we’re spinning our wheels.”
Next, he advises to write out your business’s creation story, highlighting words that exemplify your purpose and passion, such as helping, innovation, or social justice. You can also highlight concrete benefits of your product or service, such as convenient,soothing, and reliable.
Keep your keywords front of mind, share with employees, and incorporate them into your messages.
2. Use classic storytelling techniques.
Have you ever marveled at how effortlessly a great story flows? That’s because simple rules guide the narrative, all designed to make it memorable.
Great stories have six key elements: 1) a time, 2) a place, 3) a main character, 4) an obstacle, 5) a goal, and 6) ensuing events. Sounds simple, right? Yet most of us struggle to figure out how to turn everyday life into a story.
We may be slow to recognize it, but stories regularly unfold before our eyes. For example, a panicky client needs a custom cake delivered that evening, and your team — through hard work and creative sourcing — delivers just in the nick. That’s a story that can be woven into your website, social media, blog or any channel you use to get the word out.
When stories are retold over and over, they become part of the culture and heritage, says storytelling expert Paul Smith. “People will tell stories about you and your company whether you want them to or not. Fortunately, you can help choose which ones they tell.”
 3. Activate emotions.
You’ve heard it before, but that’s because it is so important. Emotional appeals draw people in and make messages stick.
Features-heavy communications are forgettable. For a lasting impression, focus on images and words that evoke feelings.
Picture a row of colorful donuts. You could say: “Our donuts are baked fresh each morning.” Or, you might create a more compelling image by using a different approach: “Is that your stomach growling?”
Tapping into the senses and promising a contented feeling triggers a part of the brain that says “act.” Here are 50 emotion-packed words to add power to your messages.
4. Test taglines for impact.
Your tagline is more than a slogan. It tells your story in a few simple words. Let’s look at those of two tech giants and decide which rings true.
Microsoft: “Your potential. Our passion.”
Apple: “Think Different.”
Not to step into the debate about which company is better, but only the Apple tagline passes the SAUCE test: simple, appealing, unexpected, credible, emotional. Test your own tagline against these five qualities. Does it need tweaking?
Fixing weak messages is worth the effort. One recent study found that more than 60% of small businesses spend six or more hours each week just on social media! Make that time count.
5. Let customers tell your story.
Your business depends on customers. When you offer people exceptional experiences, you gain loyalty. You motivate customers to build a brand story for you as they share with their networks, both in person and online.
Getting people to talk about your business is the fastest, most effective way to grow and thrive. What you say about yourself pales in comparison.

Inpart 1, we identified four personality types – the Driver, the Analytical, the Expressive and the Amiable – probing their mindset, communication style, strengths and weaknesses. In this post, we’ll dive into some specific do’s and don’ts for training each personality type. Ultimately, every personality style can sell more product. Your challenge is to unlock each employee’s maximum selling potential.
Here are the dos and don’ts of training your employees by personality style.
Drivers

Do use their innate ability to meet and greet customers in your store.
Do harness their natural fearlessness to juggle more than one customer.
Do encourage them to lead customers to new choices they may not think they can afford.
Don’t talk over them.
Don’t teach them 1960’s closing techniques to try to make a customer buy. They hate phoniness. Encourage them to be real.

Analyticals

Do encourage their technical knowledge of your products to highlight the little things most salespeople ignore.
Do rely on their patient nature to stick with customers who may not know what they are looking for.
Don’t let them overwhelm customers with their knowledge. The old saying “Don’t tell a customer how to build a watch when they just want to know the time” applies.
Don’t allow them to pour water on a customer’s choice just because they don’t know as much as your employee does.
Don’t allow them to show customers a cheaper place to buy something you carry – because they will. Logic rules with this personality style, and comparison-shopping is only logical.

Expressives

Do use their enthusiasm for new products to sell them.
Do tap their ability to mix and match to show customers how they can personalize a purchase.
Don’t let them overstate facts just to make a sale.
Don’t allow them to present too many options to a customer, or they could overwhelm the customer with choice.
Don’t let them be so eager to meet people that they smother them with enthusiasm. Teach them how to modify their energy based on the customer’s own personality style.

Amiables

Do employ their patient nature to help customers feel appreciated and valued.
Do use their ability to listen to a customer’s needs – to really hear how the salesperson can help.
Don’t let their fear of risk keep them from approaching a customer or pitching the most expensive product.
Don’t allow them to wait for customers to find them; get them out from behind the counter.
Don’t allow them to be content to just show customers what they ask for. Encourage the Amiables to have customers buy a product from you, today, at full price.

In Summary…
When it comes to personality types, there’s no such thing as “good” and “bad”. We all have elements of each. While the Driver and Expressive have the highest risk tolerance, they’re certainly not the only personality types who can sell. That’s because personality types feel comfortable with people who can talk to them the way they like to be talked to. So an Amiable selling to an Amiable, with proper training, can sell just as much as a Driver — sometimes more.
Knowing your staff will be a mixture of all personality types, you’ll need to manage them in a very specific, tailored manner. Only by understanding the unique motivators of Drivers, Analyticals, Expressives and Amiables, will you be able to empower your employees to sell more while delivering an exceptional customer experience.

It’s about doing what you love each and every day. That passion in itself is all the motivation you need. But for your employees, money is still a major motivating factor. With that in mind, this blog will look at several options for employee bonus plans that can help you get the most out of your employees while making sure they’re happy in their jobs.
A solid bonus plan can be a great way to round out an attractive employee compensation package, and offers several significant benefits to your small business:
Facilitates attraction of top candidates
Provides targeted motivation toward key goals or metrics
Enhances employee satisfaction
Like any element of your business, funding a bonus plan is no small investment. That’s why it’s important for your bonus plan to match your company’s structure and overarching goals.
Common Bonus Plan Strategies
1) Company Performance Bonus
Rewarding staff based on the overall performance of the company is the most common and straightforward type of bonus plan. The better your business performs, the greater your employees’ bonuses. The “bonus pool” is generally set at a given percentage of salary, such as 15%. If the company underperforms, the bonus might be reduced to 10% or 5%, and if the company far exceeds goals, employees might receive a 20% bonus. Overall profitability is the most common performance metric used, probably because it’s the most objective standard. Other metrics, such as increased sales, improved customer satisfaction, or production efficiency may be used in place of profitability if these are identified as more critical business goals.
Pros:
Clearly rewards team-based efforts
Builds camaraderie and togetherness
Tying bonuses to financial performance ensures adequate funding for bonuses
Most objective standard
Cons:
Lack of individual recognition for outstanding performance
Companies with erratic year-to-year revenue may be unable to reward employees whose performance is not at fault for low company profitability
2) Individual Performance Bonus
This plan lands on the opposite end of the spectrum of company plans. Generally, individual goals are established at the beginning of the year, and bonuses are awarded based on an evaluation of how successfully an employee achieved those goals.
Pros:
Clearly recognizes and rewards outstanding employees
Allows targeted rewards for specific business goals or employee behaviors
Drives overall staff productivity
Cons:
Disparate bonuses can be divisive among staff
Inherently subjective—can create issues between employer & employee
3) Hybrid Performance Bonus
If you’re willing to take on the added complexity, a hybrid performance bonus plan can leverage the best of company and individual performance bonuses. The funding of the bonus pool is tied to company performance, such as profitability. So, if the company hits its profitability goal, the bonus pool is 100% funded. That bonus pool is then paid out based on individual performance reviews, giving outstanding employees a larger bonus than those not achieving their individual performance goals.
Pros:
Rewards team results and builds camaraderie
Ensures that bonus pool is adequately funded
Recognizes outstanding individual performance
Cons:
Erratic year-to-year company performance can lead to disconnect between performance
and reward for consistently outstanding employees
Individual review is still subjective and can be divisive
Other Bonus Strategies
Innovation Bonus
It’s always a good idea to seek out new ideas. Providing an incentive for your employees to develop and successfully implement new processes or strategic improvements can keep employees engaged, drive creative thinking, and help your business stay sharp.
Referral Bonus
You’ve found one good employee. Surely they run with other like-minded friends, right? This plan rewards employees for doing your legwork for you, letting you bypass the many costs of finding and hiring great people by trusting the networks and recommendations of your current employees.
Spot Bonuses
For some businesses, rewarding very specific, one-time accomplishments is the best way to incentivize and recognize employee performance. This could be as small as $25 for a successful retail sale to a new customer. Or it could me much more significant, like a $1000 bonus for above-and-beyond efforts to land a major new account.
Bonuses should reinforce great company culture.
It’s important to relay to team members that bonuses are just that: something extra for going above and beyond. Once you’ve drawn up an outline of the bonus plan that best fits your business’ structure and goals, ask yourself if the bonus plan reinforces the following statements for your employees:
When my company does well, I do well.
When I exceed expectations, I am rewarded.
When I outperform my peers, I am rewarded.
When I help my peers succeed, I am rewarded.
Your business functions like a team — and many great teams have star players. Creating a bonus plan that recognizes and rewards each individual’s contribution toward the team’s success will help you make the most of your investment in employee bonuses, driving performance and building a great company culture.

Ready? Clearance isn’t a four-letter word. For some reason, a lot of merchants tiptoe around markdowns. But why? Your money is already gone. Feeling like you MUST get back whatever you paid for your inventory, no matter how many years ago the merchandise first arrived, is simply murder on your cash flow.
Once you embrace the idea of inventory clearance, you’ll sidestep a common pitfall for retailers: avoiding aggressive clearance because of fears of financial loss, or holding onto inventory simply because it’s tough to decide what to clear out.
This bears repeating. If merchandise is old, you’ve already lost the money. The fact that it’s sitting on your display shelves doesn’t make that any less true. The only thing it does do is make your entire store look dated, out-of-touch, or just plain old. (Don’t kid yourself by thinking there’s always going to be demand for a part or accessory to a model or product. Maybe on eBay, but definitely not on your shelves.)
Here’s the rub: Inventory clearance is an aggressive form of balancing open-to-buy. No matter how diligent you are in your purchasing process, there’s bound to be leftover merchandise in January that needs to be put on clearance to get it out the door. We’re not suggesting a storewide 20% sale of your best and brightest. That won’t do a thing to clear out the oldest inventory. We’re talking about selling off only the stock that has been lying around without any movement.
So, here’s a general guideline—the more impressive the clearance markdown is from the original price, the faster the old inventory will go. Remember to put yourself in your customers’ heads. When they approach these types of merchandise, they are only thinking about their savings off the original price, not how much they are going to spend.
Here’s the rule of thumb for brick and mortar retailers:
1. Start your clearance at 30% off marked prices for one week. Alert customers via social media or email that selections are limited.
2. The following week, markdown whatever merchandise is left at 60% off for another week. Again alert your social media followers, maybe even with a paid Facebook ad.
3. After another week, it’s time to rip off the band aid. Donate it to charity or if you have to, write it off as a loss and throw it out. Do not let it stay in your store or backroom. It’s the only way you can ensure you move on.
4. Once you have aggressively cleared out your laggards, do a physical inventory so you have an accurate picture of new product you need to buy at trade shows.
It really is as simple as that. As you follow these tips, you’ll find that nothing feels better than getting rid of old baggage. Don’t forget to keep your eyes on the prize. Putting old merchandise on clearance makes it possible to stock your store with fresh inventory which gives you a fresh start for your store.

But you can do more than wait and watch if you want to protect your business.
Check out the video below to learn five tips to help improve your cash flow.









Want a sneak peek? Here are the basic ideas:
1.     Make sure merchandise arrives in the proper season.
Don’t let your money sit on the sales floor in the hopes it’s going to sell in a different season.
2.     Set target sell-through.
How many units have to sell in 30 days for it to be considered a good buy? 20%? 40%? Decide before you buy.
3.     Tell your rep it sells or it’s refunded.
Don’t be afraid to approach your reps as a partner and let them know that if the merchandise doesn’t move within the first 30 days, you’re going to want to return it for a refund.
4.     Don’t plan purchase volume only by previous units sold.
Employee purchases can often skew sales reports for new merchandise.
5.     Clear it out quickly.
If it doesn’t sell in the first 30 days and the rep won’t take it back, put it on clearance. Poor cash flow is often the direct result of slow moving merchandise.

We have some words of wisdom, starting with Ben Franklin’s quote: “Well begun is half done.” As he understood, getting your day off to the right start can make all the difference in how it turns out. Here are some suggested tasks to try in your first five minutes that can help ensure a successful day.
1. Say ‘hi.’
Start off the day on a positive note with team members by greeting them first thing in the morning. (Yes, even on Mondays.) This is especially crucial for leaders, but it is a good practice regardless of your role. Being friendly in the morning sets a tone for the day and makes the work environment more pleasant and productive for everyone.
2. Huddle up.
Football teams use them all the time to ensure they’re on the same page. Why not your business? By keeping them quick and informal, they’re a great way for everyone to state their goals for the day and for leaders to briefly talk to their team about priorities. Working virtually? It can even be done through a videoconference or group chat.
3. Ask “What will I accomplish today?”
Make a plan before distractions strike. Ask “what’s the status of my projects? What do I need to achieve today as a result?” Write down three concrete action items to do. At the end of the day, ask “what did I accomplish today?” And be honest with your answers.
4. Plan for the tough work.
Difficult projects are rarely fun, but they have to get done no matter what. To prevent yours from haunting you all day, outline a plan for attacking these tough projects first. (Preferably during #3 above.) Make a list of first steps and action items to make getting started easier.
5. Organize the day.
Again, this fits in nicely with #3. Start your day by taking a critical look at the calendar. Reorganize it based on what needs to be accomplished that day, making sure to schedule heads-down work time during your most naturally productive working hours.
6. Clean off the desk.
Nothing beats a clean slate, both figuratively and literally. Consider cleaning your desk as the physical act of clearing your mind—perfectly setting the stage for that day’s projects. Throw away trash, file old papers, and remove from new ones not relevant to the day’s tasks. Take out digital trash as well—including the email inbox.
7. Send urgent emails.
As we all know, email can often be a huge time waster. An exception to this is sending urgent emails. Since it’s usually best to reach someone first thing in the morning, make a list of what needs to be sent, logon to email, hit send, and log off.
8. Have a cookie.
This is solid advice any time of the day. But it’s important to pay attention to your mood since it has a profound impact on work quality and productivity. Feeling a little grumpy or sluggish? Take little actions right away to improve your mood when feeling down.
9. Quiet time.
Ahh, the sounds of silence. Use solitude first thing in the morning to assess the bigger picture of your day. Reflect on where you’ve been, where you are, and where you’re going. Also ask questions like “what will give me joy today? What am I excited about accomplishing today? Who needs my help today?”
Get the gist? Good! Ben Franklin would be so proud. Now, one last question: how will you spend the first five minutes of your day tomorrow?

That’s why so many prefer to rely on gut instinct for their competitive advantage instead. And while that strategy may have worked to date, it’s important to note that big businesses are taking full advantage of big data to gain valuable customer insights. The message is clear—if you don’t adapt and grow, you could be left behind. But fear not, there’s good news ahead for small businesses.
Corralling vast amounts of complex customer data and making data-driven decisions isn’t just for large corporations with deep pockets and sizeable IT departments anymore. Thanks to the proliferation of cloud-based services, social media, mobile applications and analytics tools, small businesses can now harness custom insights to strengthen customer relationships, improve marketing efforts and enhance products or develop new ones—just like, or even better than, their larger counterparts.
Here are four ideas to help you make big data work for your small business:
1) Find a partner that understands you.
It’s no secret that big data marketing automation solutions are usually developed for large enterprises. So it’s no surprise those solutions providers aren’t accustomed to implementing or customizing their technology for the needs of small business. However, it’s also true that most big data companies were built by entrepreneurs who started out small and built their business on being nimble—just like you. Seek out partners who understand small business and offer turnkey solutions that are just right for you, or are willing to right-size their solutions to meet your specific needs.
2) Get insight on your site.
Yes, there are plenty of pay-for-play website analytics tools available. But Google Analytics is free. And their web performance monitoring tools can be implemented right away simply by adding a tracking code to your site. Once added, they provide a wealth of insight into your customers’ behavior, how they interact with your site, and short- and long-term trends. Learning the full suite can take a little bit of time, but there are extensive tutorials available online. You’ll soon find the insights gleaned will be well worth your investment of time and effort.
Google Analytics can show you:
·       How much traffic your site generates and where visitors go when they get there
·       What social media channels are performing and referring visitors to your site
·       How many visitors are using mobile devices—even the specific device type
·       What your visitors are interested in, their age, and gender
·       How much revenue your e-commerce site generates, and how long it takes for       customers to make a purchase decision
3) Don’t go one and done.
Typically, big data solution providers have one solution designed for big corporations that come with a high price tag and are complex to run and manage, leaving little to no flexibility for smaller operations. That’s why small businesses often do better with multiple solutions that work with specific business systems and applications already in place for sales, marketing, human resources, and accounts payable. Starting from scratch would be too costly and time-consuming for most small businesses.
4) Do business from anywhere.
One of the distinct values of the cloud and big data is that they eliminate geographic boundaries for your business. Through the cloud, you can share information and connect with customers—anywhere, anytime—no matter where you are located. With data that tells you where you customers are and what products or services interest them regionally or even locally, you can target your marketing more precisely and uncover new opportunities to grow.
 
These are four quick thoughts on ways you can help your small business use big data to drive competitive advantage. If you need more thoughts or have any questions, don’t be afraid to hit us up. We’re always happy to help small businesses just like yours find new ways to be successful.

Most businesses answer the first question by describing a broad “persona” of their ideal customer. As for the second question, most entrepreneurs know the 80-20 Rule: typically, 80% of your sales are driven by 20% of your customers.
But guesswork like this wastes a tremendous opportunity. Knowing your best customers well can be THE linchpin of your company’s success or failure. There may hardly be a more critical variable for business owners to maximize.
Consider a real-life parable from a Portland, Oregon coffee shop and early Clover Rewards merchant. All the staff members recognized one customer who placed the same order every day: a large half-caf latte with a vanilla-syrup shot, and a toasted sesame-seed bagel with cream cheese. His purchase totaled $5.35, which is how he earned the nickname “$5.35 Guy”.
If you’ve ever manned a service counter, chances are you fondly recall your “regulars,” just like $5.35 Guy. What most of us fail to observe, though, is how valuable regulars like $5.35 Guy are. Consider these numbers:

If this regular visits the shop every workday, he’s spending $26.75 per week, $1,337.50 annually. 


If $5.35 Guy started frequenting the shop at least once per weekend, he’d spend an additional $5.35 per week, $267.50 annually – a 20% lift. If he came 7 days per week, he’d be spending 40% more.


What if $5.35 Guy stopped visiting daily? To replace his revenue contribution, you’d have to recruit more than 10 occasional customers. (We define that group as placing the same order as $5.35 Guy twice monthly.)

That’s just for starters. $5.35 Guy is obviously loyal. How many referrals has he made for your shop, and how much business does each of those customers account for? Is he eating out for lunch too? $5.35 Guy is more than just a recognizable face; he’s a veritable gold mine. Here are a few ways Clover Rewards helps you maximize the value of your “$5.35 Guys”:

Greet him warmly by name. Clover Rewards identifies every customer by name and status, so your cashier can knock his socks off with: “Hi, Mike. We’ve already prepared your regular order. Anything else you’d like today—a sandwich for lunch, maybe?” (By the way, if Mike starts buying a $7 sandwich from you at least once weekly, that ups his total annual revenues by $350, a 26% increase.)
Reach out with special offers. What if Mike disappears for a week? Is he on vacation, or has he—egads!—bought a coffeemaker or switched loyalties? Clover Rewards specials let you reach out directly to your customer’s phone with an offer targeted directly at the type of customer he is. Specials can encourage repeat business or stimulate new buying habits. For instance, does Mike ever supply team-meeting doughnuts, working committee lunches, or happy hour for his department? Becoming his go-to vendor can lift your revenues further.


Identify potential “$5.35 Gals.” The Clover Rewards Merchant Dashboard gives you valuable customer insights. If you could identify customers with “$5.35 Guy potential” by buying habits, you could tailor marketing offers specifically for that group. Converting even one into a $5.35 Gal is worth an additional $1500 in revenue per year—equivalent to selling 750 cups-o-joe at $2 each.

The bottom line? Getting to know your “$5.35 Guys” is crucial to protecting your core revenues and growing your sales and customer base further.

In an earlier post, The Critical Value of Knowing Your Best Customers: The Parable of “$5.35 Guy”, we profiled a single repeat customer at a Clover Rewards-powered coffee shop. His daily order totaled $5.35, hence his nickname “$5.35 Guy.” With that simple, recurring-purchase habit, $5.35 Guy drove a staggering amount of business for his favorite coffee shop—$1,337.50 annually, to be precise.
The moral of the story is clear: recurring purchases add up to tremendous revenue and lifetime loyalty—if you can get them to become a regular customer. Just how does one do that, though?
A tactic many small businesses have been employing is using marketing messages and incentives to frame the business as a subscription in the mind of the customer. We call it “recurring-purchase” or simply “subscriber mode,” and it’s remarkably powerful.
When customers see your business as a subscription, a shift in thinking occurs. Once they’ve purchased so many things from you, so often, that they begin to lose count of how many times they’ve visited your store. Your business becomes an entrenched part of their daily routine, so much so that no matter what, they turn to you to keep them supplied with critical goods or services at never-failing regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).
Amazon Prime offers an interesting case-in-point. When they increased their price from $79 to $99 per year, howls of protest were heard across the internet from customers who rely heavily on Amazon’s “Subscribe and Save” feature. By signing up for recurring purchases on household items, Prime customers earn a discount for each subscribed product—not to mention eliminating the hassle of picking up laundry detergent or diapers themselves. Once they exceed five product subscriptions, the overall discount bumps up even more.
Amazon “customers” are the folks who pick up a book or CD occasionally and pay shipping costs for every item, ala carte. Amazon “subscribers” shop so frequently via the superstore that it’s a no-brainer to join Prime.
And guess which group is more profitable, customers or subscribers?
Subscribers, by a long shot.
Subscribing has its roots in magazines and newspapers, but any recurring purchase—whether delivered to the customer’s home or not—lends itself to the subscription model. Think about all the products you’d hate to run out of: milk, coffee, razor blades, toilet paper. A subscription service for tampons, Hello Flo made a viral splash a couple years ago with its Camp Gyno campaign.
The Hello Flo “care packages” are timed to the customer’s menstrual cycle and include the customer’s favorite brand of panty liners or tampons, plus candy. Not only does Hello Flo prevent customers from running out of critical supplies, it does something even rarer: makes subscribers feel cared-for.
Here are three questions that’ll help you get your customers into “subscriber” mode:
1.       What products or services do you sell on a recurring basis? This one’s not difficult. Your store’s number-one product is obvious—and it’s #1 precisely because it’s often a recurring purchase.
2.       How are those products embedded in a customer’s rituals? Now take those top-selling products and imagine the ritual that surrounds their purchase. For coffee shops, many customers pick up a weekly supply of beans on a certain day, or grab their daily cup on the way to work. Salons tend to a customer’s monthly haircut or color, perhaps provide a quarterly mani-pedi. Bars regularly cater to happy-hour crowds knocking off early on Friday afternoons or gathering for the big game. Pizza parlors help weekend revelers satisfy their late-night munchies; they’re also key fuel in university towns during finals week. Think about the “why” of that number one recurring purchase—the act or situation that prompts its purchase. That’s the subscriber’s ritual.
3.       What aspects of that ritual can you sweeten in some way? This step requires the most imagination, but also yields the greatest results. Get inside your customer’s head and consider: what emotional benefits do your customers derive from that product and its surrounding ritual? Early morning coffee-shop customers enjoy a shop’s particular ambience and a bit of friendly conversation on the way into work; it starts their day on the right foot. Salons that offer a glass of wine and some soft music make customers feel pampered while they’re getting their service; this pampering provides a hiatus from their hectic, work-a-day life. Bars provide conviviality and friendship; a good time and comradery. Pizza tastes great anytime and reliably keeps you fueled, regardless of the hour.
Once you’ve figured out the emotional benefit of that recurring purchase, you’re ready to turn your loyalty program into a subscriber-driving machine.
Start by rewarding recurring purchases you’ve identified in question 1. The answer to question 2 will help you understand purchase frequency. Then align the recurring purchased product and frequency patterns with question 3’s emotional benefit to choose a reward that’ll complete your customers’ ritual, making them feel understood and appreciated—making that emotional benefit an essential part of the purchase, something they come to expect and look forward to. Also look for ways to use that now-essential emotional benefit part of the ritual to begin to nudge them towards expanding their recurring purchase in some way. Suggest complimentary products or services that factor well into the overall experience.
Once you’ve got your regulars here, they look at your business not as a “nice-to-have” but rather an essential part of their day.
In conclusion, recurring purchasers aren’t bound by contractual obligations. They’re tied to your business by habit, loyalty, and all the intangible good feelings that come with a personal ritual.
Find the “why” of the recurring purchase and cater to the experience it provides, and you’ll have a steady stream of “subscribers” in no time.

But in the real world of running a business, sometimes the hectic pace can get in the way of good intentions.
When you close up at the end of the day, are you satisfied that you’ve supported and connected with your people? Are they giving their best efforts in return?
If you’re unsure, consider cultivating some of the qualities that boost enthusiasm and commitment.
1. Great bosses show appreciation.
Paychecks aren’t everything. Study after study shows that people need to feel valued. They want their efforts to matter, and their contributions to be recognized.
Yet, less than 40% of workers feel their bosses are genuinely interested in them. One problem is that bosses get busy and old habits take over, such as criticizing or withholding compliments.
Praise is far more effective. Catch your people doing a good job—and let them know you appreciate it. Acknowledge their efforts to make your business strong, and they’ll make it even stronger.
2. Great bosses give employees control over their lives.
For many part-timers, the worst part of their job is the unpredictable work schedule. Anddisillusioned employees are going public about the practice.
As a boss, it can be tempting to plug names into time slots and call it a day. But for workers juggling school, family, or hopes for a social life, erratic schedules can be maddening.
Take scheduling seriously. Gather input about people’s availability, let them review their shifts, and establish fixed schedules when possible. Give employees the power to switch shifts with others when their plans change.
Small gestures such as these can pay out in less frustration and less turnover.
3. Great bosses train people to be successful.
Have you ever been tossed into a job without enough information? Not fun—and not a great way to get up to speed.
Time may be precious, but it’s important to train people properly. Help them understand the products, customers, and competition. Get them proficient with the cash register, inventory processes, or updating the website.
The quicker they’re working effectively, the sooner you can delegate. More time for you!
4. Great bosses listen to others’ ideas.
Sure, it’s your business and your baby. But good ideas can come from anywhere—especially your frontline staff.
Ask for their advice. Learn about problems they’re having with customers or merchandise. Solicit their ideas about possible solutions. Showing that you value another person’s input is a powerful motivator.
5. Great bosses build camaraderie.
You don’t have to hire a Chief Fun Officer to create joyful workplaces. Anyone can do it and reap the benefits, such as attracting great employees and keeping them engaged.
Eating lunch together, remembering birthdays, celebrating successes—simple gestures can boost a sense of teamwork and togetherness. Find out about more inexpensive ways to create an enviable company culture like Google’s.
6. Great bosses get out of the way.
Great bosses know when to swoop in and fix problems. But they also know when to hang back. They manage without micromanaging, which saps employees’ trust and autonomy.
And consider this: trying to control people is not only exhausting, it can also stunt their ability to do their jobs. “You create a vulnerability when your team isn’t used to functioning without your presence and heavy involvement,” writes leadership expert Muriel Maignan Wilkins in the Harvard Business Review.
No matter how detail oriented you may be about running your business, once employees have enough skills and knowledge, let them fly solo.
7. Great bosses mind their manners.
As people move into positions of authority, they sometimes neglect core behaviors that will help them succeed. They get impatient, snap out orders, or talk down to employees.
But workplace incivility has consequences. In one poll, 78 percent of those who had been treated rudely said their commitment to the company dropped, and almost half said they intentionally reduced their efforts.
Keep your people committed and engaged. Communicate with employees politely and treat them as important contributors who can help your business thrive.

But did you know that if you run a small business, engaging with it could boost your sales? This article covers the essentials of what Pokémon GO is (for the uninitiated) and how merchants like you can make it work for your business.
What is Pokémon GO?
Pokémon GO is a video game developed by Niantic and Nintendo for people to play on their phones and mobile devices. It utilizes Augmented Reality—adding a digital component to real-world experiences and locations so that players can search for and engage with new characters embedded in their surroundings, wherever they are.
The game adds Pokéstops (areas with special characters or engagement opportunities) to specific locales across the world. Park spaces are popular for Pokéstops, but they can really be anywhere. These spots tend to draw in users looking to capture new characters, develop their existing characters, or engage with other players  For a detailed explanation geared towards the uninitiated, check out this great article on Vox.
In the few short weeks since its release, Pokémon GO has seen a meteoric rise in usage,surpassing the daily active users of Twitter on the U.S. Android platform. And, it’s important to note, the same study showed that the daily active users spend more minutes per day in Pokémon GO than Facebook.

Why do I care?
Think about how real estate prices are calculated for retail spaces. In addition to square footage and layout, one of the biggest factors is location and probable foot traffic. Pokémon GO has garnered such a high volume of users in such a short time that it is radically affecting foot traffic in certain areas, which in turn, affects your business opportunities.
Foot traffic is primarily increased around Pokéstops. If you’re near a Pokéstop, you’re in luck, because there are ways to leverage that for more foot traffic. If you aren’t, you are welcome to apply for one through the Niantic support page, but likely, your request will fall on deaf ears.
How can I tell if there is a Pokéstop nearby?
If you’re looking to get involved with the Pokémon GO craze, step 1 is identifying any Pokéstops near you. Aside from becoming a player and wandering around, here are two ways to figure it out:
The easiest means of identifying a nearby Pokéstop is to check in on your business through Yelp.  They’ve just added a filter so that players can see if a shop or eatery will set them up to grab new characters.
Maybe you’re looking for something more specific? You can check in with the map of locations developed for Niantic’s previous Augmented Reality game, Ingress. You will have to sign up for Ingress and look up the maps of activity, but sites used for Ingress are nearly all setup as Pokéstops or other hubs of activity.
Map of Ingress Locations
What can I do with this information?
Like most phone-based games, Pokémon GO provides ample opportunity for users (including merchants) to spend small amounts of money to increase engagement. The general currency, called Pokécoins, is earned by playing, but can also be purchased at the rate of 100 Pokécoins for $0.99.
In the context of small business, you’re going to want to spend your Pokécoins on lures. These lures can only be placed at a Pokéstop, but will make more characters appear. This will certainly be of interest to players in the area, so luring them for the characters can also lure them into your business. Of course, it’s still up to you to convert them into customers, but simply attracting new potential customers is a valuable gain for a small price. Lures run for 100 Pokécoins ($0.99), but can be purchased in packages of 8 for 680 Pokécoins (roughly $7). These lures last 30 minutes, so you are talking about a $7 investment for 4 hours of increased traffic.
Maybe you don’t have time to manage your lures and keep the foot traffic moving in the Pokéverse. Have no fear; companies are already launching to help you stay on track.LureDeals will manage your lures for a small fee, and you can rest assured many other side businesses will be popping up in the intricate Pokéconomy.
Bottom Line
Plenty of small businesses out there are finding innovative ways to boost business with lures, specials, and creative advertising. There’s no denying that Pokémon GO is a hot business right now with a lot of international attention and high levels of engagement across the globe. Even with the implications it might have for small businesses, not everyone will find the right pathways to make this craze work for their bottom line. Will you?

All you need for that is a business card. But if you need to hire employees, you need to raise money from investors, or you want to protect yourself from being personally liable for the business’s debts, you may want to set up a more formal business structure.
When you decide to move beyond a sole proprietorship, you will need legal advice. Your local chapter of SCORE, a nonprofit association dedicated to helping small businesses succeed, may be able to offer you some advice or connect you to a lawyer. The Small Business Administration also has some resources on its website.
Here are some of the most common business structures:
DBA
When you start working as a sole proprietor, the name of your business is automatically your name. If your name is Jane Smith, your business will be called ‘Jane Smith’ by default. If you’d like your business to be called ‘Jane Smith Designs’ or anything else, you will need to file a DBA, or a ‘doing business as’ name. You’ll also need a DBA if you’ve already set up an LLC or a corporation and you want to do business under a different name.
This should be a simple, straightforward process. You just file your new name with your county or state, depending on the regulations where you live. The SBA website can help you find the rules for your state.
LLC
An LLC is a limited liability company. It’s the simplest form of business you can set up. It’ll protect you from being personally liable for business debts—without a lot of paperwork—but you’ll still be taxed as a self-employed individual.
LLCs can be owned by a single person or two or more partners. To form one, you need to register with your state and, depending on your state, you may need to create an operating agreement that explains how your business is organized and how profits will be distributed among its members. Still, registering an LLC is much simpler than setting up a corporation, so the paperwork is relatively light.
As the name implies, an LLC will limit your personal liability for the business’s debts, as long as you are diligent about keeping business and personal activity separate. All the business’ profits and losses will pass through to your personal tax return (and the returns of your partners, if you have any). That means you’re not filing a corporate tax return on top of your personal return, but it also means that you’re considered self-employed for tax purposes, and you’ll be taxed on your business’ entire net income.
Corporations
A corporation is a separate legal entity, owned by its shareholders. It protects you from personal liability. In order to set one up, you’ll need to file articles of incorporation and meet other administrative requirements. Creating a corporation allows you to raise money by selling stock, but because of the fees and paperwork involved, it probably won’t make sense to do this until your business starts growing significantly.
If your business is a corporation, it becomes a separate taxpaying entity. Typically, corporate tax rates are lower than income tax rates, but in some cases, corporate income may be taxed twice—once when the corporation pays its taxes and once when you as an individual collect the business profits in the form of dividends.
S Corps
An S corporation, or S corp, is a specific type of corporation that eliminates the problem of double taxation. To set one up, you’ll first file as a corporation, and then complete anIRS form to designate that corporation as an S corp. You can also register an LLC as an S corp.
The key benefit of an S corp is that the corporation itself isn’t taxed. As the business owner, you’ll pay yourself a salary, and then you can take any remaining profits as distributions. This means you won’t pay self-employment tax. You can withhold taxes from your salary, and the tax on your distribution payments will be lower. But you’ll need to be careful how you organize these payments, because unusually low salaries and high distributions may trigger an audit. Your salary has to be in line with the standards for your industry.
Whatever business structure you choose, you will need a lawyer to help you set it up correctly. But there are a variety of ways you can wall off your personal assets from the success or failure of your business, minimize your tax burden, and build a business that’s prepared to grow over the long term.

Thus, it isn’t a huge shock that he’d go on to co-found a business that isn’t just successful online, but relies solely on e-commerce and communication.
In 2012, along with two other partners, Dan founded PANYL. Their product is a DIY furniture wrap that allows users to customize their furniture at an amazing price point. PANYL makes custom design elements possible for budgets that rely on ready-made products.
Spawned from the idea of finding an efficient and inexpensive way to create custom designs for commercial photo shoots, PANYL is now available in a variety of colors and textures to spruce up any space. Their templates already include measurements for a broad swath of IKEA furniture, but they are more than happy to handle custom designs for furniture from anywhere.
PANYL’s lack of a storefront doesn’t take any pressure off of management, although the day-to-day might be a little different than a traditional retail outlet. Dan graciously agreed to answer a few questions about what it takes to run a business like PANYL.
What does it mean to you to be a business owner?
It means there’s no bureaucracy. I can make decisions immediately. It also means that I can follow my passion while responding directly to customers whom I interact with every day. It means not having to report to somebody else. It means not having to compromise on my vision.
What is at stake in an online business?
Our reputation is at stake every day. When you don’t have a large organization supporting you, you really have to hustle to get back to customers immediately, make sure that their full range of experience with you, all of those touch points, get the right attention. My biggest concern is that customers out there are having a really good experience with our company at every turn.
What keeps you motivated?
We have an incredibly long list of projects: product extensions, new designs, and new ways of selling. Unless we are incredibly tight with all of our processes, we don’t have time to change and innovate in our business. I’m always looking for that opportunity to save time and do things more easily, because we’ll use that capacity to focus on something else, something new.
What makes shopping with PANYL different than other retailers?
PANYL is an add-on product, which is a major factor in why we exist only in e-commerce. There’s not a lot of point to us having a storefront presence, since often, our customers are shopping for PANYL online while in other stores looking at furniture. We manage all of our customer interactions online, and have to be sure that we are just as easily accessed on mobile devices for this very reason. If you look at our sales reports, at least 40-50% of purchases are taking place on a tablet or mobile phone.
How has Clover helped you grow?
Knowing that I have a global financial powerhouse behind my transaction engine, that my credit card data is secure, allows me to do what I love to do—promote and fulfill sales. We wouldn’t be able to grow as fast as we have if we didn’t have that kind of support. When we opened in mid-2012, our sales were doubling every month. It was like being strapped to a rocket! Even now, we grow roughly 30% each month. With support from Clover Online Store, transactions happen one day, and money is transferred into our bank account usually the next day.

In fact, seeking a loan from a big bank may be the least effective way to get cash for your business—big banks are currently approving only 23.3% of small business loan applications, according to Biz2Credit’s most recent Small Business Lending Index. In contrast, small banks and credit unions are friendlier to small business loans—credit unions currently approve 41.6% of loans, and small banks approve 48.8% of loans. Still, even smaller community banks are out of reach for many businesses. Restaurants, for example, are considered too risky by many traditional lenders, and business owners with poor personal credit aren’t likely to be approved for bank loans.
So what do you do when your business needs cash and a bank loan is a no-go? Here are 5 places to find quick cash for your small business:
1. Marketplace lenders. Alternative lenders like Lending Club typically approve more than 60% of loan applications. Interest rates range from 5.9% to as much as 30%, depending on the borrower’s credit history. Applications can be submitted online in just a few minutes, and if you’re approved, you’ll get the cash fast, sometimes even within 24 hours. But not all businesses qualify. Lending Club only lends to businesses that have been in operation for 2 years and have $75,000 in annual sales, for example.
2. Lending networks. Networks of marketplace lenders like Fundera link small businesses to multiple lenders at once. With one application, you can check your eligibility for multiple different types of loan products including lines of credit, term loans, and even SBA loans. Of course, the type of loan and lender you’ll be able to work with will depend on your personal credit, your business history, and other factors.
3. Crowdfunding. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter offer the chance to raise money from ordinary people who are less concerned with credit scores than they are with how much potential your business has. Some require you to give your backers rewards; others ask you to give away equity in your company. Peer-to-peer lending networks likeKiva can be extremely low-cost options—but in any form of crowdfunding, you’ll have to do the legwork to market your business in order to get the cash. This option will likely work best for businesses that benefit the community or sell a unique new product—anything that will appeal to a broad audience of ordinary people.
4. Clover Cash Advance. Clover offers cash advances to businesses that process sales through First Data. Businesses only have to have been in operation for 9 months and processing credit cards for 6 months, and there are no personal credit score requirements. Your business can get an advance of up to 100% of your monthly average credit card sales, and repayment is totally automated—Clover will simply withhold a small portion of your credit card sales every day. That means there’s no need to worry about making payments or having money pulled out of your business account.
If a traditional bank loan won’t work for you, there are plenty of options out there, many of which will get you cash within a couple of days after you’ve applied. There’s no reason to let a black mark on your personal credit report or the perceived risk of the industry you work in hold your business back.

Your customers, both current and potential, use mobile devices with great regularity. This probably isn’t news to you, but the numbers may shock you: 58% of consumers who own a smartphone have used it for store-related shopping. The data from Black Friday 2015 indicated that over 36% of online sales were via mobile. For merchants, that means that mobile simply can’t be ignored.
An easily accessible and navigable mobile site impacts both offline and online sales. Many searches start on mobile devices, most of which lead to a conversion. And while those conversions may take place elsewhere, the original visit was a mobile one. This point also highlights the particular value of mobile for millennial shoppers, 82% of which have used a mobile device while in-store. The numbers for offline and online don’t stop there:
?      34% of online retail purchases happen on mobile devices
?      84% of smartphone shoppers turn to their mobile phone to help them shop while in store
?      53% of consumers use their smartphones to search for directions to a local store
?      54% of consumers use their smartphones to search for business hours
It’s clear that mobile is the way forward. The unstoppable growth and influence of mobile over all purchases proves the fact that every merchant needs a mobile-friendly online store. The driving factor behind all of this is improving the customer experience. It just makes sense—the easier you make it for your customers to find and buy what they’re looking for, the higher the likelihood you’ll make the sale. Currently, only 52% of consumers surveyed said they were satisfied with their mobile shopping experience. That means there’s a huge opportunity for merchants that can master the mobile shopping experience to set themselves apart from their competition.
That’s where Clover Online Store comes into play. No matter the state of your current website, Clover Online Store helps you get mobile-friendly in a hurry. Every purchase from your website is from a single POS hub—so all of your stock counts are updated. All of this isn’t to say a mobile-friendly site will serve as a silver bullet, but having a mobile-friendly site is an expectation of all of your customers, both online and offline.

Expanding can be a great boost to your business if you do it right, but it’s also likely to magnify any problems your business already has. After all, expanding requires a huge capital investment, not only in real estate, but also in staff and logistics. And new locations will take time to grow into their full potential. If you’re not careful, growth could kill your business.
If you’re a Clover merchant, you already know about the great apps available to help you run your business better. Be sure to look closely at options within TruBeacon’s Multi-Location, an incredible system that integrates with Clover and helps you with various issues owners and managers face. Here are three ways Multi-Location helps keep all of your systems consistent whether you have 5 locations or 50.
1. Data, and how you’re going to keep track of it
You might be able to have a gut-level sense of how one store is doing. But with multiple locations, you won’t be in every store every day. As you expand, you’re going to need robust systems that will help you keep track of how each individual store—and the business as a whole—is doing. Multi-Location makes it easy to generate reports on individual stores or your whole chain, even from your mobile device. Want to know how many sesame vs. pumpernickel bagels you’re selling every day? Want to see how customers are responding to the increase in the price of coffee? Need to keep track of your inventory by location and overall? With Clover, you have that information at your fingertips whenever you need it with instantaneous updates with every transaction.











 


2. Your staffing needs, and how they are met
With one location, you’re there all the time, and you set the tone. You hire and supervise everyone. Once you start to expand, you’re going to end up being less hands-on. You can’t be everywhere at once. One of the most important issues for your employees is knowing their schedules and having clear communication for any changes. Multi-Location helps you manage schedules across all locations, allowing you to move your staff around as needed, and track performance metrics when relevant. Know who is working for you and how they are doing, with all the reference materials you need at your fingertips.
3. Back-end logistics. 
As your business grows, your needs are going to change in ways you can’t necessarily anticipate now. Maybe you’re going to add a new business line. Maybe you’re going to experiment with a new staffing structure. When you’re growing rapidly, you can’t know today what you’re going to need next year. You need a back-end system that can evolve and adapt along with you. Having software that can grow with you is crucial. The cloud-based Multi-Location app can do just that.Expansion is a risk—but so is starting a new business in the first place. When you decide this new risk is worth taking, make sure you think it through carefully and prepare the groundwork for a successful expansion.

That’s because, as a 29-year member of the Coast Guard, Jenkins knows the skills that a veteran brings to his business.
Jenkins is the CEO and founder of W4 Construction Group, a Pontiac, Michigan-based federal prime contractor—a general contracting company that performs construction, heating, ventilation, remodeling, and electrical work. The name refers to “Chief Warrant Officer Four,” which, in the Coast Guard, is the highest rank an enlisted person can achieve. (Jenkins is currently a W3 and will earn W4 status before he retires in 2017.) “W4s are considered technical experts, so that’s why I came up with the name W4—because we want the company to be the best of the best,” Jenkins says.
To achieve that greatness, Jenkins relies on his experience in the Armed Forces, knowing that it’s priceless in helping him be a successful business owner. “There’s no doubt in my mind that I am who I am because of my military experience.”
Here are 4 ways military service builds business savvy.
Veterans gain valuable job skills while on active duty.
After getting recalled to active duty in 2009, Jenkins was tasked with the coordination of rebuilding the Coast Guard base on Galveston Island after Hurricane Ike. Working with “scores of contractors” with “10 different agendas” trying to put the island back together, Jenkins learned the ins and outs of project management—expertise that he uses today overseeing his employees and the various subcontractors that work with W4. “Everyone thinks their project is the most important…it’s up to me to prioritize and make sure all the contractors are doing what they’re supposed to be doing.”
He also gained precious experience working on federal projects. “The last thing [a federal contractor] wants to have to do is babysit a new company…and they don’t have to because I bring that experience,” explains Jenkins.
Veterans have their comrades’ backs.
During his time in the Coast Guard, Jenkins performed search and rescue missions. “We had a crew of three or four people and we had to rely on each other and our training,” he says. The values of trust and loyalty are just as important today at W4. “I have to be smart enough to surround myself with the right people,” Jenkins says before going on to explain that W4 refers to all employees as team members. “I’m not a big fan of going to work for a paycheck; I want people to be on our team because they want to be.”
Not surprisingly, Jenkins describes himself as “a big fan of veterans.” W4 currently employs 16 people, seven of which are veterans. But Jenkins’s loyalty to former service members extends beyond those at his own company. After a successful first meeting with Clover and having the opportunity to meet the vice president of First Data (Clover’s parent company) who also happens to be a veteran, Jenkins was, in his words, “floored.” As a result, he’s connected Clover representatives with other veteran-business owners. “I’ve realized that First Data is committed to us as a business and as veterans,” says Jenkins. “So it makes sense for us to be committed to them,” stressing the important of finding and patronizing businesses that are truly supportive of veterans.
Veterans remain calm and think long-term.
Soldiers may not have bombs and bullets raining down on them at all times—but they’re trained to remain cool during times of adversity. That skill directly translates to the business world when they’re constantly facing unexpected circumstances, demanding clients, and unhappy customers. “One thing I love about veterans is that they are calm and disciplined; most of us don’t overreact. We don’t react emotionally,” Jenkins says.
Along the same lines, they’re also particularly adept at thinking through situations and not issuing knee-jerk reactions. Instead of making a decision that’s only appropriate in the moment, veterans think about the big picture. “Our mission with W4 is to be strategic planners,” says Jenkins, noting that this skill is particularly valuable in his line of work.
Veterans recognize the importance of mentoring.
Almost three decades ago when Jenkins joined the Coast Guard, he noticed that the military stressed mentorship and how the older guys always helped the younger ones. Today, he’s paying it forward by assisting other service members, including mentoring a fellow veteran who’s trying to start a business. “He told me, ‘You know what you’re doing, so I’m willing to listen and learn from you,’” Jenkins shares. “I like helping people and when they show me that they’re in it to win it, I go all in.”
As this veteran gets his company up and running, Jenkins plans to share some of his trade secrets—including Clover. “Like I said, I’m about helping veterans, [Clover is] about helping veteran businesses. So why can’t we turn around and help Clover by bringing them more veteran customers?”

There are so many […]…",11-08-2016,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-customer-insights-hidden-in-your-google-analytics/,"If you’re looking for ways to improve sales and need some ideas, try checking out what your data tells you. If you have a website, Google Analytics is a free program that reveals critical information about your most valuable customers, from demographics to what they look at before deciding to buy. There are so many wonderful things that are hidden in the data if you know where to look.  Here are 3 steps you should take to reveal gems hidden in your data.
Step 1: Set Goals
Every website, and every page on your site, should have a goal. Goals can be anything: encouraging an in-store visit, collecting a prospective customer’s contact information, signing up for coupons, or purchasing right off the site. Goals are not only important for figuring out how well your business is performing. Having a goal in mind when you design the page will help make sure customers visiting the site take the next step toward purchasing. Setting goals is an easy way to tell Google Analytics which data is most important to you.
For an ecommerce site, the most important goal is to make a sale. After making a purchase, the customer gets a “Thank you” page. Ask your web designer to insert code on this page so that every time a customer makes a purchase, Google Analytics takes notice and you can segment out that data later. Then set the goal up in Google Analytics under the “Admin” tab.  Make sure you also assign a value to each goal. If the customer made a purchase, determining their value is easy. But you should also assign values to other behaviors like signing up for alerts or coupons. Later, when you analyze your data and see how many visitors you didn’t convert to a sale, you can get a better sense of how much potential revenue that customer would have given you had you converted them.
Step 2: Determine the Demographics of Your Most Valuable Visitors
You probably have a picture in your mind of your ideal customer. But how do you know if that picture is accurate? Take a look under the “Audience” tab and click on Demographics. The overview gives basic demographic information on the visitors to your site such as age and gender.











 


More interesting is to click on the “Interests” tab and then click on “Affinities” or “In-Market Segments”. This will give you an indication of the types of websites your visitors also browsed, and it sometimes also indicates products they would also be interested in.











 


If you established goals, you can also segment out categories of people who visited your site. Simply click at the top on “Add Segment” and choose the segments you want to view. For example, you can view only the web traffic of people who purchased from you. That separates out people who are just window shopping and give you real information on who your most valuable visitors are.











 


Even if you haven’t set up goals yet, there are some types of traffic you should be able to segment out. Below we’ve separated out the age demographic of all website visitors and compared it to visitors who returned within a specified timeframe. Return visitors are usually people who are more interested and more likely to buy. Don’t forget that Google Analytics only captures online shoppers. To get the same kind of insights for all your customers, both online and off, check out the Clover Insights app, free on the Clover App Market.











 


Step 3: Determine Which Pages Are Important
Every buyer goes through a journey before making a purchase. Customers typically move from awareness, to consideration, to evaluation, to purchase. It’s your job to determine what they think about and look for in each of those stages and make sure the page they are on gives them the information they need to move on to the next step.
If 90% of the people who purchase also read through reviews before buying you may want to make the product reviews more prominent on key pages.  Similarly, if 70% of people who eventually buy visited the homepage, you know this page is somehow important to people considering a purchase.
To view the customer’s path through your site, Click on the “Conversions” tab in the left rail, then on “Multi-Channel Funnels” and then on “Top Conversion Paths”. Then click on “Secondary dimension” above the list and choose “Landing Page URL Path”. This shows you which pages converting visitors visited and in what order.











 


For a quicker way to view this information graphically, try looking under “Behavior” and click on “Behavior Flow”. On the left side of the graph you’ll see which pages were the most popular starting points for people who converted. Click on one of them and select “View Only This Segment” and you’ll see which pages people visit after that initial landing page. In the case below, we’ve selected the homepage. Note that Google shortens URLs and won’t show your domain name. So if your website is widgets.com and your blog is widgets.com/blog, traffic to the blog will be shown only as “/blog”. Similarly traffic going to your webpage will be denoted simply as “/”.











 


The screenshot above illustrates a segment of traffic that started (Starting page) on the homepage. Of the 28K sessions that started on the homepage, 12K dropped off the site, 7.1K used the search box, 3.5K used the subject drop-down menu, 935 used the sitemap, and 708 went straight to their account. The “Second interaction” indicates where the traffic went from there: 3.9K dropped off the site, 2.6K looked at details of a product, 2.2K used the search feature, 1.8K went back to the homepage, 1.1K clicked on a subject in the menu navigation, and 751 went back to their previous search results. This tells us, at a high level, that the homepage is very important, as is the search box and “subject” navigation, so making sure these pages are both a good user experience and include key purchasing information s very important.  In contrast, if you find a campaign you’re running isn’t converting as many customers as you had hoped, try funneling that traffic into the top converting landing page.

When people search for you or your product, you want to be on the first page of Google’s search results. Google is looking for fresh, valuable content that answers the customer’s search query, so blogging is a great and creative way to improve your SEO and visibility. The closer the content on your site fits what the customer wants, the more likely Google will bump you to the first page of search results. Here are 3 counterintuitive blog ideas that will improve your SEO.

List your competition. That’s right. Listing your competition can be a great way to boost traffic. Let’s say you’re a local sandwich shop. Create a blog post on the Best Places for Lunch or Great Downtown Restaurants in your city. List all the options—including your competition.  That blog post will not only attract people looking specifically for you, it will attract anyone looking for a restaurant in your area. Having a really popular post will improve your site authority for “restaurant” searches in your city. Your honesty in listing the competition also helps build trust making customers more likely to buy from you in the future, even if they’re not looking for you today.
Admit to flaws. Every product has its flaws. Be open about it. If a person is trying to decide whether tobuy a new bathtub or refinish the one they have, they’ll search for information like: problems with reglazing a bathtub, how often do reglazed tubs have cracks, how long will a refinished tub last, or will a reglazed tub really look new? All of these questions and problems are things that customers will consider before they buy. If you provide the answers to these questions, you’ll keep appearing in this customer’s Google results and they’ll start to think about buying from you. A great place to brainstorm ideas for this type of blog is Clover’s OwnerListens app where customers can directly let managers know about concerns they have.
Be transparent. Often customers are deciding between different things. Offer an in-depth analysis of the pros and cons of different product types and be totally transparent. If a customer is thinking of buying a dog, they will probably conduct a lot of online research before deciding which one is right for them. They might search for: Which dogs are not good in apartments, which breeds are good with children, which dogs are likely to ruin your furniture, and what dogs are fine to leave alone when you’re at work. If your blog answers these questions and is frank about the pros and cons of each breed, you might become the customer’s main source of information about dogs and a natural place to start when it’s time to buy a dog or look for products for a new pet. You’ll also build site authority on the subject of dogs, which will help boost your content for “dog” searches in general.

Google likely has a ton of sites to choose from when deciding what should pop up on the first page. Thinking through the customer’s consideration process before buying your product will help you create original content that brings in visitors and future customers.

Brian Nicklason and Nick Pappas’s grandparents knew one another. Their parents grew up together in the same small community. Brian and Nick have been friends their whole lives. They’re so close that Nicklason says he can’t remember them ever having an argument. The business they now own together, Six Beans, is named for their children—they each have three.
The family atmosphere carries through the whole business. Nicklason is the company’s CEO, and his wife is the COO. She runs the front-of-house operations and sets the tone for the customer service. “What sets our business apart is we have great coffee, we have great drinks, and super-friendly service,” Nicklason says.
That warm, friendly service is delivered through a drive-through window. “We are more tailored to the commuter, the busy professional, moms, teachers—people who have stuff to do but still want really good coffee,” Nicklason says. It’s been a popular concept so far, and the drive-thru model cuts costs compared to a traditional retail space, but it does mean that the typical transaction lasts less than three minutes.
That’s not much time to create a relationship. And yet Six Beans has had great success signing customers up for its loyalty program and turning drive-thru consumers into regulars. Here are four tips for building customer loyalty in just a few minutes a day:

 Make it easy. At a drive-thru window, speed is of the essence. Six Beans uses Clover Rewards, a free app available to Clover merchants on the App Market. Clover Rewards keeps things easy for staff and customers alike. It’s integrated into the Clover POS system, so it’s simple and fast for staff to call up a customer’s account without keeping them waiting at the window. On the customer side, it’s app-based—all the customer has to do is download an app and check in with each purchase to earn and redeem perks almost instantly. There’s no plastic card for the customer to lose, and the transaction is seamless every time.


 Keep reminding customers of the option. Six Beans prints a notice about its rewards on every Clover receipt, and baristas mention the loyalty program to every customer. That means that even though staff doesn’t have much time with each customer, each customer still hears about the rewards option each time they come through. The information on the receipt makes it easy for customers to download the app at their convenience, and then credit the customer for their last transaction towards earning free perks.


 Be flexible. For most customers, the Clover Rewards app–called Perka on the customer side—is easy to use. It’s right there on their smartphones, at their fingertips, every time they come in. But there are some customers, mainly older folks, who aren’t comfortable using an app. “Not everybody is as tech-savvy as we’d like,” Nicklason says. Six Beans allows customers who prefer a low-tech solution to simply keep their receipts and show them at the window to claim their rewards.


 Be prepared for success. Six Beans has had its rewards program in place since day one. Nicklason crunched the numbers on the program before opening, but uptake has been even stronger than he planned for. The program is set up so customers get a free drink after buying 10, and there are other levels beyond that—25 drinks gets you a free muffin, and so on. “We’ve given out probably close to a thousand cups of coffee using it,” Nicklason says, but because the coffee business enjoys comfortable margins, the customer loyalty program is still good for business. “We give out more than I expected,” Nicklason said, “but that means we’re selling more than I had expected, too.” (Nicklason’s experience is actually quite typical for merchants with active rewards programs. As a recent University of Chicago study indicates, loyalty programs tend to increase purchases by 20% or more.)

Nicklason is happy with the way Clover Rewards and Perka are building customer loyalty for Six Beans—even in the short interactions required in a drive-thru operation. “Perka is a great choice,” he adds. “It’s simple, and you can manage the expense of your rewards. I would definitely recommend giving it a try.”

That’s right: According to a study of more than 5,000 consumers, 67% reviewed the return policy before making the decision to buy. This may explain why the average cart abandon rate varies between 60 and 80%: Before making even small purchases, most customers will review the return policy to make sure they won’t get stuck with items that don’t work out. Yet, until now posting a policy was a bit of a hassle requiring a separate page or updating your business information page. Clover Online Store has just released an upgrade that makes creating and updating return policies easy.
Here are 3 reasons to review your return policy today:

Improve visibility. Give them what they are looking for: with the new upgrade, your policy will appear in the footer of every page—right were customers expect to find it.
Build trust. Business 2 Business reports that as many as 30% of purchases are eventually returned. With the new upgrade you’ll be walked through all the elements of a carefully-constructed return policy. The policy will be automatically generated in clear and transparent language so there are no surprises or irate customers later.
Inspire loyalty. In a related study 90% of consumers said they would purchase from the same store if returns were easy. Every transaction builds a relationship with customers: Make sure your policy inspires loyalty with clear language and visibility on every page.

Ready to get started? Clover Online Store’s return policy tool makes it easy:

Log into your Clover account.
Click the Clover Online Store application to launch the app.
Scroll over to the “Store Settings” section of the Clover Online Store dashboard.
Scroll to the “Set Up Refund Policy” section and select “Review.”
Select either “No returns or refunds, all sales are final,” or “I want to create refund policy” and hit save.
Follow the prompts to fill in details of your policy and click “save.”
To view the new return policy, visit your homepage and click on the link in the footer: “Shipping, Refund and Contact Information.”

Crafting and posting a clear return policy is only the first step: Make sure the actual process of returning items is as painless as possible. Retailers like Amazon and Zappos have made free and easy returns the norm, so keep that in mind when crafting your policy: 80% of consumers report they won’t shop at a store if returns are a hassle and 77% expect free returns.
Clover is not just a POS system—we’ve got everything you need to improve sales and create a professional image. Check out the Clover App Market for more ideas.

This will cut the time it takes to get the money into your account, maybe by as much as 24 hours. Think about it: it can take about a day for money to transfer from one bank to another. Why make your money travel any further than it needs to?
 Optimize your host close time. 
What time does your day officially end? When does your system close out one day and begin the next? Within the Clover system, for example, merchants are defaulted to a close time of 1:00 a.m. Depending on what time your business closes, you might be able to close your day earlier, which could help you get money into your account faster. If you’re a Clover partner, call our support desk. Our team can help you walk through your options to make sure your system is optimized for fast funding.
 Make sure your network is bulletproof. 
Have you ever suffered through a busy day without wifi? If your staff has to hand-key credit card transactions, not only will your processing be delayed, but you’ll end up paying additional interchange fees. Fees could go up from 1.51% to 1.80% or more, and those extra charges will add up quickly. With a Clover system, you can continue taking credit card transactions even without wifi, helping you make sure your funds are processed quickly and without additional charges.
 Keep your tech up to date. 
The U.S. is in the process of transitioning from a swipe-and-sign credit card system to a chip-and-sign system. As of about a year ago, merchants who don’t have the capacity to read chip cards are liable for any fraudulent transactions on chip-based cards. Clover card readers either come chip-enabled or are easily adapted to read chip cards. Make sure your system is up to date with the latest technology, so you don’t run into any trouble with fraudulent transactions.
Any merchant wants to make sure money gets into their account as quickly and reliably as possible. With a Clover system, next-day funding is possible for many merchants. But whatever type of POS system you have, taking a few simple steps can help ensure that nothing delays or interferes with your funding. And that’s good news for any small business owner.

In Gallup’s annual poll about financial concerns, 2016 saw upticks in each category surveyed, from medical costs to saving for retirement.
For small business owners, these problems can be even more acute. Just ask Justin Henshaw, who opened his first Fuse Frozen Yogurt in 2012 on St. Simons Island, Georgia. With no startup capital of his own and a tight credit environment, Henshaw struggled to get his business off the ground.
Through “persistence and a little luck,” he succeeded and now owns three dessert shops in this scenic corner of the Southeast coast. But funding can be an obstacle for many entrepreneurs, especially “when you’re relatively young and don’t have a lot of assets,” notes Henshaw.



Luckily, most small business owners say that credit availability and cash flow have improved since the depths of the Great Recession. In fact, 68 percent reported feeling optimistic.
The challenge now is to keep that positive momentum and continue growing the business. Clover money-managing apps are designed to get you there—by bringing business metrics into one place, uncovering ways to cut costs and boost profits, and reducing money worries. Here are four apps that merchants turn to for help with managing their money challenges:

Reporting lets you stay on top of your business’s financial picture with easy-to-understand data. Simply launch the free app or Clover web dashboard, and you’ll find reports and metrics about payments received, items sold, discounts given, and taxes paid. Good data that’s up-to-the minute helps you focus on efficiency and profitability.


In an age when many customers use plastic for their purchases, keeping track of the green stuff can be complicated. Cash Log tracks transactions for you, including all cash drawer activities such as adding or removing bills and coins. By letting an app do the work of monitoring cash and simplifying recordkeeping, you free up time to focus on core business activities.


Banks aren’t the only lenders in town. For speed and simplicity, Clover Capital offers a new alternative for securing funding. Whether you want to make renovations, upgrade equipment, or expand, simply log in to your Clover station, fill out a one-page form, and hit submit. Clover Capital turns future credit card sales into working capital now, when you need it.


No one can afford to hang on to merchandise that isn’t moving, especially items with a limited shelf life. Coupons N’ Combos helps you sell off excess product by creating any combo, discount, and coupon combination imaginable. Mix it up and get creative, while clearing space for more profitable items.

On top of great products and services, solid employees, and a steady flow of customers, small business owners need the essential fuel that keeps the engine of business running: money. Clover apps help you get, keep, and manage it, the smart and stress-free way.

If you’re craving a doughnut, how many options do you have to get your fix? The bakery world is a crowded market. There are the major chains, of course, and then there are local options. So how do you make your business stand out? How do you become a destination that loyal customers will return to again and again?
According to Seattle Metropolitan Magazine, Seattle’s best doughnuts can be found at FROST’s three locations. But as any small business owner knows, a superior product is no guarantee of financial success. Here are five things FROST does to stand out in a crowded market:

 Be different. FROST produces not only a high-quality product, but also a unique one. Unusual flavor combinations and fresh ingredients have been part of the value proposition from day one—think guava-coconut doughnuts and limoncello macaroons. “People’s palates have become more sophisticated, with the Food Network and foodie culture,” says Daniel Sterling, FROST’s CEO and creative director. And yet when FROST first opened, in 2009, nobody in the area was doing anything “interesting” with doughnuts, Sterling says. The company’s unique flavors are “the number one reason people come to FROST,” he continues.


Keep the experience fresh. FROST’s other signature attribute is its constantly changing menu. At first, when they had only one small store, continually rotating flavors was partly a necessity—they couldn’t display a lot of product at once, so they switched up the menu a couple of times a week. Now that changing menu is baked into the brand. FROST releases new flavors about 10 times a year, changing the menu to suit the season. “We find that people get really excited about new items that come out,” Sterling says. If there’s always something new to try, then there’s always a new reason to come back.


 Reward repeat visits—literally. FROST uses the Clover Rewards app that’s integrated into their Clover POS system. “Before we moved over to Clover, we had a POS and a separate loyalty system, and there were just too many steps in the process,” Sterling says. Guests would come in not knowing how many rewards points they had, and staff would have to make other customers wait while looking up their account. With Clover Rewards, it’s all integrated, and customers can access their accounts on their phones, so they come in to the store knowing how many points they have and what they can get. FROST can also use the same system to push out offers to its loyal customers. Sometimes, if a particular flavor isn’t selling, they’ll do a one-day flash sale, and all their best customers will get the alert instantly on their phones.


 Get the customer involved. FROST holds a Design Your Dream Doughnut every year for National Doughnut Day. Because FROST is known for its creative flavor combinations, Sterling says, customers have always suggested new ideas. So FROST has created an annual tradition that gives people a chance to actually see and taste their creations. Three finalists are chosen, and on National Doughnut Day, customers can taste the nominees and vote for their favorite. This year’s winner, a bismarck filled with salted caramel cream and topped with potato chips, will be back on the menu in the fall. The festive, participatory atmosphere created by the contest helps make National Doughnut Day FROST’s busiest day of the year, and the crowds just keep growing, Sterling says.


 Build a brand and stick to it. Two of FROST’s three locations have recently added luncheonettes. Even as they expand their offerings, they’re sticking to their core brand proposition: freshly made food and unique flavor combinations. “People are used to getting interesting products at FROST, not your typical things,” Sterling says. So their lunch menu includes unusual offerings like a Thai chicken curry soup and a turkey and curried apricot sandwich. The lunch menu, like the sweets, will also change regularly, so it’s always fresh and seasonal. Everything about every store reinforces the idea that FROST is the place to go for a fresh, fun treat—the stores have an upscale, boutique feel, and customer service is paramount. “We try to make coming to FROST a fun experience for everyone that comes in,” Sterling says.

Any small business needs to figure out how to create a strong, memorable brand. Take a tip from FROST and build a brand that rewards loyal customers for visiting again and again.

Enticing them to buy your coffee over the competition is a great way to get loyal customers. National Coffee Day is right around the corner on September 29, 2016. If you don’t have anything planned yet, there’s still time and we’ve got the apps to get you started.
Here are 5 ways to promote your business on National Coffee Day:
Offer free coffee to loyal customers.
If you’re going to give it away, give it to people who sign up for your rewards program. Promos offers simple ways to capture customers’ contact information so you can market relevant products to them later.
Don’t offer a rewards program yet? Our free Rewards app enables Clover merchants to launch a fun, effective loyalty program within minutes. In fact, a great way to launch your rewards program is offering a free perk just for enrolling. A great cup of joe to celebrate National Coffee Day makes the perfect incentive to jump-start your program.
Dress up your coffee for free.
Free coffee is great, but that alone is not really a differentiating factor. What makes your coffee better than the competition’s? Does your store have a special way to dress up coffee—maybe with a killer brioche or biscotti? Do you offer flavor shots? Offering a free add-on for the holiday is a great way to advertise your unique twist on the coffee ritual. Not only is this a way to get more customers in the door—if they enjoy your one-of-a-kind treats they are more likely to pay for them in the future.
Conduct a social media contest.
Want your coffee to go viral? Ask customers to post photos of themselves enjoying your coffee during the holiday. Monitor engagement using Hopr or use a special hashtag. Offer the customer with the most-shared image free coffee for a week.
Give the gift of coffee and build your word-of-mouth.
Buying someone a cup of joe is a great way to say thank you, so facilitate this with a free referral program. Using the Customer Referral Reward app you can capture not only the walk-in’s contact information, but their friends’ and coworkers’ as well. Research from Wharton shows that a customer who was referred to you is 18 times more likely to come back as a loyal customer over time than the average customer, so generate some organic leads through referrals.
Spread the love.
Make your loyal customers the office hero: Give them coupons or a new promotion if they buy four or more coffees. Coupons N Combos generates printable coupons automatically when certain combinations are purchased. You’ll introduce an entire office to your coffee and drum up some repeat business.
We’ve got everything you need to boost sales. Check out the Clover App Market for more ideas.

Whether small business owners are looking for something portable that fits in the palm of their hand or a powerful countertop model, Clover offers users a sleek, user-friendly POS system that accepts all types of payment methods. But dig deeper than that, and you’ll discover that there’s much more hiding inside that stylish white system.
Clover’s App Market enables you to run your business better, thanks to apps that track your hottest sellers, manage your employee payroll and schedules, issue gift cards, monitor inventory, and much more.
Here’s a peek inside just a few of the great apps available to you through your clover device.
Shopventory
If you have, say, a kitchenware or clothing store with several locations, clearly you’re an accomplished small business owner. Achieve even greater success by using the Shopventory app, which optimizes management of retail inventory across all locales. Not only does it store all of your sales and inventory reports in one place, but it also provides the total value of your stock at a glance.
Customize the app’s dashboard to view current data and compare it with historical sales performance in just seconds—reducing the time-consuming job of being a business owner by an average of six hours each week. You can also create personalized alerts that notify you when inventory of a specific item falls below your designated threshold. Easy-to-read tables provide detailed information—including quality sold, discounts applied, and total profit — on sales in a particular category.
iCabbi
Millennials love to do everything on their smartphones, including eHailing a car when they want to go somewhere. (The number of 20- to 24-year-olds without a driver’s license decreased by 15 percent from 1983 to 2014.) Combine that with the ever increasing population movement to urban centers and the global taxi market is expected to grow by 1 million vehicles by 2020. Which is why taxicab owners need to hail this app immediately for their Clover POS.
iCabbi is a tech platform that helps traditional taxi drivers regain market share by providing perks to customers they used to only get from private drivers, including the ability to book a ride online via a consumer-facing app and acceptance of credit- and debt cards and other contactless payment options. Riders can trace their progress on a map and request an e-receipt instead of a printed slip. Additionally, the enhanced security feature protects a rider by allowing them to alert dispatch with the tap of a finger.
Wash Dry Fold
When people drop off their clothes at a laundromat, they’re not trusting the staff to take care of their first-born child—but it’s close. If bleach gets on their favorite Coldplay concert t-shirt or their perfectly broken-in pair of jeans shrinks, there will certainly be a very angry customer to manage.
Wash Dry Fold’s clutter-free home screen makes it easy for any laundromat employee to input and check out customers, reducing the amount of time patrons need to allow for when dropping off their laundry. There’s a clear spot to enter personalized instructions (tumble dry low, no bleach), ensuring high-quality service for each patron. And the superb customer service doesn’t end when a full hamper is input into the system: text messages are sent when loads are marked “ready for pickup”—meaning that customers don’t show up in advance of their laundry being washed, dried, and folded.

A great POS system gives your small business the ability to make big strides, but these apps (and others in the Clover App Market) will help it peak.

For those businesses to flourish, however, they have to make the most of their often-limited resources. How time and tasks are managed can make or break a new business.
Just ask Joseph Paolercio (also known as “Meatball Joe”). His food truck specializing in top-notch meatballs cooked in their special six-hour sauce is a popular destination in South Florida.



 
But nurturing and maturing a business can be tough. As demand for his product has increased, so too has the demand on Joseph’s time. But as a Clover merchant he has solutions available at his fingertips that can help him make the most of both his and his staff’s time. Here are some of the great apps from the Clover App Market that can help businesses save time and increase productivity.
Manage staff schedules with Time Clock
Time Clock is a free app for Clover merchants that provides solutions for a lot of staffing stresses. Employees can clock in and out, track breaks, declare cash tips and integrate credit card tips, and handle shift trades with other staffers. Managers can send out schedules by email, manage time-off requests, and have payroll-ready timesheets at their disposal with an easy export function.
There’s also an iPhone and Android app everyone can use to monitor schedule changes, get reminders about upcoming shifts, and communicate with others in the event that a switch is needed.
Manage money with Cash Log
Another free app, developed in-house at Clover, is Cash Log, which helps merchants track all customer cash transactions, including managing cash drawer activities like adding or removing cash. With effective tracking like this, merchants can save time that they can use to refocus on developing their product, growing their market share, improving operations, or taking some of the stress out of their schedules.
Manage inventory with Stock
Say farewell to complex logs and spreadsheets managing inventory. With Stock, merchants can keep track of every item at every location. It allows businesses to create and edit purchase orders, adjust inventory numbers as necessary in the event of breakage or loss, manage vendors, and even transfer stock between locations. Merchants can also generate reports with ease, freeing them up to focus on more important tasks.

There are a lot of ways merchants can encourage greater spending. Here are a few.
Encourage add-on purchases
There are a lot of techniques that business’s use to encourage purchases, ranging from color coding to scientific layout design. These can be very helpful when organizing merchandise, but just as important is staff behavior and interactions. Anyone working a register or on the floor of a business should be familiar with all products and services offered. Training to help staffers on the frontline of customer interactions can help them anticipate the needs of those they assist, pointing them towards new ways to engage with a business, and spend more money.
Establish a rewards program
The last decade has seen substantial growth in loyalty programs across industries. Customers are more likely to return to businesses that reward them for repeat purchases. Rewards programs are integrated smoothly into the Clover platform via Clover Rewards, found in the Clover App Market. An important feature of Clover Rewards is the option to have customers earn points based on dollars spent rather than simply the number of visits in a standard punchcard. This is a great way to motivate customers to spend more at each visit, and provide perks for them in return.
Run targeted specials
Also available in the Clover App Market is a new offering, Promos. This app allows merchants to reach out to various segments of their customer base—first time customers, occasional customers, or regulars—and create custom promotions designed to entice them back for more. Parameters for these specials are entirely at the discretion of the merchants, making for a broad spectrum of options to drive sales through repeat business.

Anyway you look at it, merchants must retain customers and grow their business to find success in a crowded marketplace. As always, Clover is here to help. Visit the App Market for a variety of business solutions for every industry.

And yet, one of the essential investments any business needs to make to compete in today’s market is the ability to accept credit cards. But with so many moving parts to any credit transaction, it’s more difficult than ever for merchants not to get tagged with chargebacks through the course of doing business day-to-day. With that in mind, this article takes a look at what exactly a chargeback is and, more importantly, what can be done to avoid them, protecting the business the customers alike.
What’s a chargeback, anyway?
In short, chargebacks are disputed transactions. They were originally designed to act as a failsafe for consumers, ensuring that they can get a refund for their purchase. And while that’s a wonderful option for consumers, card issuers still need to hold someone accountable for the lost revenue from that transaction. In the default situation, guess who that is? That’s right, it’s the merchant. Remember Rule #1 above? Subjecting a business to potential chargebacks definitely qualifies as an unnecessary cost.
How can businesses protect themselves?
First, be aware. This may seem obvious, but it’s amazing how many merchants don’t take a close look at their transactions. Knowing that fraud is the number one reason for chargebacks, being on the lookout for telltale signs of anything out of the ordinary—unverified user details and different shipping and billing addresses—can go a long way in protecting your transactions.
Second, be EMV (Europay-Mastercard-Visa) compliant. Starting in October 2015, all businesses that accept electronic payments were required to have “EMV Compliant” point of sale (POS) systems. These EMV Compliant systems are capable of reading the extra security layers transmitted by EMV chip-enabled cards. When businesses don’t have an EMV Compliant point of sale system, they are automatically liable for any fraudulent transactions if they accept payment from an EMV chip card.
To be clear, if a POS device doesn’t have the ability to read EMV chip cards, the business is vulnerable to future attacks, and all future chargebacks. With that in mind, it might be time to upgrade the POS system to become EMV Compliant. Not only is it an industry mandate, it’s a smart investment. Any money you spent upgrading systems will be a fraction of the cost incurred in potential chargeback fees.

When Doug Cedrone, along with his business partner, decided to open Beer Noggin in Bronxville, NY, they had a lot to learn.

Luckily, they decided to partner with Clover for payments processing and a variety of small business solutions. Here are three great ways that Clover supports emerging entrepreneurs in addition to established businesses.
Reach more customers with Clover Online Store
Every business needs a website, but designers can be pricey. When opening a new business, every penny counts. Clover Online Store can help set up a website and create a retail portal with ease. Why limit a business to customers in its immediate vicinity when it could be selling the product to anyone with an internet connection?
Spread the word with Abreeze Link
Make sure the customer base is kept up to date about specials, new products, and other important information. This can often go by the wayside in the hustle and bustle of opening up shop, but has profound effects on a new business’s bottom line. Use Abreeze Link, available for MailChimp and for Constant Contact, to manage communications and make sure the customer base establishes a relationship with the business.
Analyze data with Clover Insights
If all goes well, new business owners are usually occupied with customer service, product design or curation, and various other tasks that appealed to them in the inception of their business. But as all of that goes on, a Clover device can track all of the sales data and provide crucial information to help steer the business direction. Downloading Clover Insights ensures that this important data is organized and available with just a few clicks.

Don’t be daunted by the challenges of starting a new business. Use your Clover to help your business grow and thrive. Learn more by visiting the Clover App Market.

Let’s face it. EMV hasn’t been easy.
This week marks the one-year anniversary of EMV in the United States, and yet you still find yourself doing the ‘do I dip or do I swipe’ dance with your customers, followed by a wait that can seem like forever while the transaction completes. With the rush of the holiday season right around the corner, what at first was a minor inconvenience may transform into even longer lines for your customers as they tackle their holiday shopping.
At Clover, we get it. That’s why we offer POS devices that help you manage your business and save precious seconds when checking out your customers. An EMV transaction on Clover comes in at less than three seconds from the initial dip of the EMV card to the onscreen message instructing the customer to remove the card. Specifically, Clover Mini clocks in at 2.93 seconds, which can vary based on Internet speeds.

Given that our parent company, First Data, has been a leader in commerce enablement for more than 40 years, it should come as no surprise that we offer some of the most competitive times for EMV transactions. First Data is at the forefront of EMV expertise and readiness, as the company has been producing EMV-enabled cards and processing EMV transactions for several years. No one else can compete with the scale and distribution of First Data, which supports six million merchants in 118 countries around the world with everything from EMV to online shopping.

But in spite of best efforts, cybercriminals are doing all they can to thwart security measures. One of their favorite ploys is using malware. This blog explains what malware is, how it’s being used, and most importantly, how Clover can help.

What exactly is malware? In short, malware is any form of hostile or intrusive software used for malicious purposes. Of course, no one would knowingly allow such software to be installed on a computer or point-of-sale system. So, how does it happen? Cybercriminals are devious. They send links or create attachments in SPAM emails that enable and install the malware once opened or clicked. Just like that, malware infects the computer and provides immediate access to sensitive data.
To make matters worse, when customers pay online or in store, their card data is exposed at certain critical points in the process. If cybercriminals find vulnerability in a network, they’re able to easily capture critical user and credit card information. They, in turn, can use this information to commit credit card fraud or identity theft, or they can even sell this information to other third-party criminals.
Sounds bleak, doesn’t it? But fear not, all hope is not lost! With Clover, card data is encrypted at the point of sale. This means that even if a cybercriminal or malware is present, the data is unreadable. It works by safely storing card data for later transactions by replacing the data with a unique token. And with Clover Security Plus, merchants also get access to software and hardware monitoring. Together, Clover provides the ultimate protection against malware and cybercriminals.
A quick footnote on how to further protect devices from malware: never, ever click a link or open an attachment in an email from an unknown sender. Cybercriminals are masters at playing on our natural curiosities. In that one moment of inquisitiveness, cybercriminals can get the foothold they need in a system to spread malware. Also, be absolutely sure that emails are from who they say they’re from. Cybercriminals are now incredibly adept at spoofing SPAM emails to look like they’re from legitimate businesses. If there are any questions about an email, be conservative and don’t click it. Better yet, don’t even open it. The old mantra of ‘it’s better to be safe than sorry’ is more applicable than ever in today’s connected world.

Not only is it becoming increasingly popular, a recent study showed that 66 percent of recent shoppers agree with the statement: “YouTube is one of the best sites to help me visualize how different products fit into my lifestyle.” In fact, having videos on product landing pages has been shown to increase conversion rates as much as 80 percent according to EyeViewDigital. Here are 5 ways to make video even more effective on your site.
Include all metadata.
Having different elements (such as photographs or videos) on your site allows you to also include additional metadata, which is information about the video that is invisible to the visitor, but is read by Google. So if you are an ice cream shop in Spokane, WA, and posted a video of testimonials, you could also include metadata such as:

Location: Spokane, WA.
Who: Customer reviews.
Creator: Charlie’s Ice Cream.
Date: When the video was created.
Summary: Video customer reviews of Charlie’s Ice Cream in Spokane, WA.

The benefits of including all this information is that if someone Google’s “customer reviews of ice cream shops in Spokane” your shop is more likely to appear toward the top of the Google search results. And here’s a bonus tip: Google likes to serve up the most recently updated websites, so updating your videos often will help improve your rankings in Google.
Include a text description.
Whatever type of video you’re sharing, include a text description or a transcript. This will further improve your SEO rankings and ultimately help you gain more organic traffic.
End every video with a clear call to action.
Every video should have a goal, and the end of every video should encourage the viewer to take the next step toward purchasing something from you. Don’t just tell them what the next step is: include a clickable link that takes them to the right page where they can purchase something.
Involve your customers.
People visiting your site are often evaluating whether to purchase from you. One of the reasons video is so persuasive is that it’s a very authentic way to engage with customers. Use regulars in your videos to demonstrate how to use your products, or to give reviews of their favorite things about your business. Customers are also more likely to share videos if they are in them.
Promote it in social media.
Videos are incredibly popular on social media sites: 82 percent of users watch video in Twitter. Once you have a video you’re proud of, share it on sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin.
For more tips on how to use social media to engage your customers check out Clover’s suite of marketing apps.

Starting a new restaurant business can be especially tough. Researchers at Ohio State and Cal State Poly concluded that 57 to 61 percent of restaurants fail in the first three years, with about 26 percent failing in the first year, about 19 percent in the second, and about 14 percent in the third.
That said, if you’re reading this, we can assume two things: one, that you’re an owner or manager of a restaurant and two, you’d like for that restaurant to stay in business, perhaps for the rest of your life.
So we thought it might be a good idea to get some restaurant biz advice from someone who’s been through it—and became one of those aforementioned statistics.
Meet Sarah Haselkorn of St. Louis, MO. A serial entrepreneur from an early age, Sarah always had a knack for starting businesses. So when the need for healthy food options nearby presented itself while she was attending Washington University, Sarah partnered with St. Louis natives Tim Fetter and Adam Gremp to open up Green Bean, “a salad shop with a mission to save the world!”
Unfortunately, ultimately, it was the Green Bean that needed saving. Due to a number of unavoidable, serious life situations outside the business, as well as some mistakes made early in the business by first-time restauranteurs from which they were unable to rebound, the team at Green Bean closed up shop after two years in business.
Fortunately, Sarah was kind enough to sit down with us and share some hard-earned, hindsight advice for those in the restaurant biz:
Don’t fail to leverage your network
Entrepreneurs, by nature, are do-it-yourselfers. Being such, many have a hard time asking those around them for help. Sarah said this was a crucial mistake for her. She found out, in some cases too late, that those in her network had a wealth of knowledge that she could have leaned upon. Whether it’s a family friend’s delicious potato salad recipe, an uncle who’s owned his own business for years and knows how to navigate legal issues, or just your circle of friends and their numerous extra hands, you’ll be surprised how many people will be willing to help you get your restaurant off to a good start if you just swallow your pride and ask.
Don’t spend on non-essentials.
There’s a reason that the business world has been obsessed with the concept of the “lean startup” model lately—it works. In the beginning, it’s important to allocate resources carefully, as cash-flow will be tight and you’ll be operating on thin margins, so make sure to only invest in systems that will directly affect the bottom line in the core of your business. Perhaps your green salad-wrap lunch counter doesn’t need a world-class espresso machine right off the bat? Asking yourself the tough questions about which elements are truly essential to your business will give you some wiggle room enabling you to deal with the inevitable emergencies that almost always arise.
Don’t assume your communication style works with everyone.
Again, entrepreneurs are famously terrible at asking for help, so when it comes to building a sense of camaraderie and teamwork among employees, a lot of entrepreneurs have a difficult time delegating responsibility in a manner that suits everybody’s communication style. You may think that when you’re barking orders at your team, that they know you mean it with love, but unless you stop to tell them, reward them for jobs well done, and adapt how you speak to people depending on their personalities, you’ll have a hard time building the kind of team that you can depend on to do right by your business when you’re not watching.
Thanks Sarah for the great advice!

So when he decided to leave his successful job as a nurse practitioner to open a retail shop closer to home, his entrepreneurial spirit came out. Returning to his other degree in furniture design, he decided to open an antique gift shop in Chatanooga, TN. Despite his enthusiasm and solid business instincts, even he was amazed at how quickly he outgrew his space.



 
“The biggest surprise when starting this, is how quickly we developed a clientele and how quickly we caught on,” says Meadows. “When you invest time and money you want to see a return and not just a financial return. We were able to do that quickly.” Burlap & Board grew so quickly they had to upgrade their space in a little over a year. What’s his secret? Here are 7 ideas to bring more customers into your store.
Partner with other businesses.
Burlap & Board is not just an antiques mall. They’ve also partnered with local artisans. Each antique vendor and artisan has their own individual store.
Partnering with artisans and craftspeople can be a challenge. By nature, artists are not interested in conforming. “You have to help them and guide them and educate them about the legalities and what they need to do,” says Meadows. Each artist adds to the creative ambiance special to Burlap & Board.
With Clover’s barcode system, Burlap & Board is able to quickly and easily tag each item in the store with the correct vendor. There are no handwritten tags for any of the 22 dealers, and each dealer can be confident they will get paid correctly even if a customer picks up an item in one place and leaves it in another. This system also affords them the flexibility to share space and can mix and match products to create atmosphere.
Make them feel at home.
Winters encourages his vendors to create vignettes of particular time periods. “I love that people love to come in and browse,” says Meadows. Customers naturally gravitate toward the period they are passionate about. The entire store then tells a cohesive story that offers a better experience, and customers are more inclined to buy more than one purchase as they see pieces that work together. This is a huge competitive advantage over other antique malls. If customers come in and the store has “pleasing aesthetics, they are going to come back again,” says Meadows. “Whether they are local or a tourist, the next time they are in the area, they will return.”
Encourage local business—year round.
One of the best things about having a retail business in a historic area is you get to meet people from around the world. But as Meadows points out, “When the local people come in, they are there year round. They give back to the community.” So make sure you offer something unique that will keep locals coming back.
“Customer service is huge,” says Meadows. “They will return if they are treated right. We greet them, tell them a little about the store, and answer questions, but we don’t follow them around.” At Burlap & Board artisans create a unique experience, and people need space to experience the magic. “The locals love the uniqueness of the store.”
Offer unique, consumable products.
Every antique, by nature, is unique. That’s not enough, though, to get steady traffic. Consider stocking products that are both unique and consumed regularly. Early on, an artisan made the soap for Burlap & Board, but then wasn’t able to do it anymore. Meadows decided to make it himself. “It sold very well. I didn’t want to lose that portion of the business, and I would rather make it myself and make sure the quality is there.” Soap is not only consumable; it can be tailored to what the customer wants, and over time becomes something they look forward to. “We bring out a new soap scent every month. Sometimes over the holidays we do more, like for Mother’s Day we brought out two scents. We have 22 different scents, but they all sell well.”
Encourage impulse sales. 
With Clover’s mobile devices it’s easy to encourage impulse sales. Simply move inventory outside for an impromptu sidewalk sale. “We have two main devices at the checkout. We have the mini that we are upgrading in our coffee bar. We use the mobile hand held in the office and on the road. We use all of them so we don’t have to take away from our front register.” Having multiple places within the store where customers can make purchases is smart because the customer doesn’t have to wait online to grab a quick coffee or buy something on the fly.
Get out of the store. 
Customers not coming to you? Go out and find them. Burlap & Board books outside shows and fairs where antique lovers are likely to go. “Clover allows us to go to remote locations and set up and do transactions quickly. We are more confident when we book an outside show, and we’re able to enjoy it more.” Everything is integrated and tied together, so if customers at a show ask you if you have more of something, you can easily look at inventory and sell more. Having a stall at shows also gets the word out that your store exists and will bring people in from farther away.
Cultivate passionate customers. 
Love what you do? Set up classes and turn your local customers into regulars. For Burlap & Board, offering classes gives them regular foot traffic, a steady influx of cash, and encourages repeat business from the locals. They make a profit on selling supplies as well as classes and it allows them to sell things in batches as they grow.

What makes all of these things possible? Clover is an app-based system and offers businesses the flexibility to customize their system to create offerings that work for them. For Burlap & Board, ConsignAble and Bundle Discount apps help grow business. Explore the app market for ideas that will work for your business.

Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
People love to give thoughtful gifts, and gift recipients love to be able pick out exactly what they want.
Sometimes the perfect gift comes in the form of a prepaid card, either digital or plastic, with funds to spend at either a favorite store or a brand new spot. As the holidays approach and you begin to stock your small business with great merchandise and plan holiday promotions, consider implementing a gift card program. Gift cards are a great way to increase sales, improve brand awareness, and—most importantly—bring in new business.
In the past it was difficult and expensive for a business like yours to offer gift cards. Not anymore. These days, even the smallest start-up businesses can easily launch a gift card program that includes custom branded plastic gift cards as well as digital solutions. Yes, providers now have affordable options for independent businesses to add their business name and logo to cards.
 
As a business owner, you already know your customers are the best promoters for your business.
By making gift cards available to them, they’ll be better able to promote your business to their friends, family and co-workers. Just think how happy they’ll be to see a smartly-designed, branded point-of-purchase (POP) display that showcases a selection of custom gift cards and card holders—especially at this time of year when time-crunched holiday shoppers are looking for quick, thoughtful options. Potentially, hundreds of new customers could have gift cards with your business name stamped across the front.
 
And it gets better.
Let’s say you don’t have an online store but you want to be able to sell gift cards online. Well, now there are providers that can provide you with an eCommerce storefront just to sell gift cards. Customers can choose to have plastic gift cards delivered by mail or elect to have digital versions delivered directly to the recipient’s email inbox or through text messaging.
Some gift card providers will even connect you with online gift card malls and national distributors to enable you to sell your gift cards to a wider audience. In some cases, they can also assist with packaging your gift cards with other merchants in your area to create special value pack incentives to help spur sales even more.
The power of gift cards doesn’t end with the revenue generated from the value of the card. You have the opportunity to develop long-term, loyal customers as gift card recipients redeem their gift cards.

With gift card sales in the US reaching $130 billion last year, a 6% increase over 2014, you can’t afford not to start your own gift card program. It’s a win-win for everyone. Business owners benefit from a happier customer base, and customers get to enjoy the multiple options you have to offer. Before the holiday season begins, consider finding a reputable, full-service provider to help you launch a gift card program. This could be the most successful holiday season yet.
 
Pick a provider that delivers
The best gift card providers not only provide card design and delivery, but also offer tools, support and guidance to help businesses manage their program to maximize success. When choosing a provider, look for a full-service solution that offers:

But it’s actually small businesses that face the biggest threats from hackers. Nine out of ten data breaches involve small businesses, according to Trustwave SpiderLabs, and more than 40% of small businesses have suffered a cyber-attack, according to the 2015 National Small Business Association year-end report. These attacks typically cost more than $7,000. And the threat is growing: data breaches increased 55% in 2014, according to the 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report.
What makes small businesses vulnerable to attack? Why would a hacker go after your small pool of data when there are much bigger targets out there? First of all, of course, many small businesses are less protected than major corporations. And increasingly, hackers are finding that they can combine the data from multiple small businesses to create a rich prize, according to the National CyberSecurity Institute.
Security threats are everywhere. We all use our mobile devices more and more, for more and more functions—which makes it easier for hackers to attack these devices with malware. And the threats are only going to grow as every aspect of our lives becomes more connected. The ‘internet of things’ will increase the threat of cyber-attack, according to the National CyberSecurity Institute, because it will be relatively easy to hack internet-connected devices. In the next few years, anything from a toy to a watch, a piece of clothing, even a dog collar or a refrigerator could be a point of vulnerability for hackers.
Unfortunately, many small business owners feel they’re not prepared to deal with a cyber-attack. Overall, about 43% of business owners say their business is only slightly prepared, or not at all prepared, to deal with an attack, according to a recent Babson College survey of business owners.
How prepared do you feel? How vulnerable is your business to hackers and other bad actors? If you use Clover Security, you’ve got state-of-the-art technology on your side. Clover’s system uses the latest end-to-end encryption and tokenization technology to protect your data–and your customers’ data.
End-to-end encryption helps protect data while it’s on the way to being authorized. Customer credit card data is vulnerable during the time it’s being transmitted from your POS terminal to a server for processing. Some encryption systems focus on the ‘tunnel’ through which data moves, leaving it vulnerable at the split-second moments when it transfers from one system to the next. End-to-end encryption scrambles the data itself, so it’s better at protecting the data throughout its journey from place to place.
Tokenization is another advanced cybersecurity technique. Customer credit card numbers are replaced with randomly generated numbers, so the actual data isn’t stored in your system at all. Even if hackers did break into your system, your customers’ sensitive information wouldn’t be at risk.
When a large corporation gets hacked, its reputation does take a hit. But the difficulty of changing banks, or the convenience of one-stop shopping at a big box retailer, may mean customers stay loyal anyway. For a small business, the damage could go deeper. Small businesses are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and the cost of suffering one could go beyond the immediate hit to the bottom line. Why not use the best possible technology to protect your business and your customers’ peace of mind?

October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. Throughout the month the Clover Blog will feature articles to help you protect your business and your customers from internet fraud, theft, or attack.

Obstacles that slow merchants down repeatedly are more than just annoyances.
What many merchants don’t realize is that simple fixes often do exist to resolve these recurring challenges for good. The result? Merchants can reclaim valuable lost time, boost incoming revenue, reduce costs or some combination of these—all because they spent a few minutes evaluating whether current processes, equipment and software still meet the business’ evolving needs.
This post outlines 3 telling inconveniences that coffee shops, cafes, and other quick-service restaurants struggle with, and ways to resolve each of them.
1. Lines are long and move too slowly.
Customers patronize quick-serve restaurants because they’re short on time; make them wait too long and they’ll simply leave.
Start by talking with the best cashiers. What factors consistently slow down the line? Are they always running low on change? (Our new app CoinOut enables cash customers to save spare change to their mobile phone. This saves merchants time, expense and hassle while speeding up the line for everyone.)
Additional devices like Clover Go or Mobile help merchants “line-bust” effectively, too. Staff can ring up purchases for folks while still standing in line, relaying those orders automatically to the kitchen for delivery. All transaction data gets stored in the Clover Dashboard, so nothing gets lost in the mealtime rush. Line-busting is smart for another reason: a customer is unlikely to leave abruptly if they’ve already paid.
2. Customers wait forever for delivery orders.
Running a profitable delivery business is tougher than it seems. Deliveries must arrive within a predictable time window and be accurate (and still hot!). Customers demand flexibility in when they pay (either by phone, online, or directly to the delivery person) and how they pay (cash, credit or debit cards, even gift cards or mobile payments if the business offers those). Top-performing delivery people should be recognized as such, and slow-pokes cut from rotation.
Trouble-shooting delays in a delivery business also requires research. How consistent and robust is the delivery business currently? If the café only gets intermittent delivery requests, but those request rob the kitchen of a valuable player, that’s a problem.
Is the delivery radius well-defined and not too large? How many VIP customers live within the radius? (Clover Insights can answer this question.)
Talk to delivery staff. What slows their progress? Should they switch from driving to biking? How accurate are deliveries against orders? (Nothing will gum up the works faster than reissuing an inaccurate order.)
Strong delivery businesses eventually become impossible to handle manually. The Clover App Market offers numerous delivery-optimization apps, integrated with your Clover POS, at affordable prices. (For instance, Bringg is free for the first 50 deliveries per month, with a 25-cent per delivery charge thereafter.) Just search the App Market for “delivery” to explore options.
3. Staffing levels rarely match customer demand.
For most businesses staffed by part-timers, employee scheduling is among the boss’ biggest headaches. Particularly in food service, part-time staffers often switch shifts with each other, not always notifying the person in charge, and sometimes just failing to show up. Meanwhile, the uneven ebb and flow of customers can make a short-staffed day a nightmare.
How to cope? First, recognize the bottleneck in scheduling systems is usually the scheduler herself. An online system that gives employees and managers visibility into shifts, and the ability to swap shifts freely, can save tremendous amounts of time. Timeclock by Homebase has proven among the most popular Clover time-saving apps for good reason.
Now for the staffing-to-demand question. Again, Clover Insights makes it easy to analyze the busiest days (or nights) and discern patterns for planning. An email- or text-based scheduling app can ping employees eager to pick up extra shifts when demand is high, too.

Recurring operational problems can eat up a tremendous amount of time and effort and feel impossibly tough to solve. But solving many of these issues can take less time than you’d expect. Browse our app marketplace to see if we’ve got an app or solution that’ll solve that issue for you. Contact Clover for a more detailed conversation about our point-of-sale solution.

Staffing is one of the most important challenges a business faces, whether it is new or established, small or large, retail or restaurant. Just ask Jay Walters, owner of Jay’s Steakhouse in Rifle, Colorado.

Clover aims to create solutions for challenges every business owner faces. Here are three apps available in the Clover App Market that help owners and managers stay on top of staffing needs, changes, and crucial exchanges.
Ping Me If by Seven Spaces
Most business owners can’t be in house at all times. Perhaps they’ve got other locations to supervise, obligations in their family and community, or (gasp!) a need for some time off. It’s important to stay on top of unusual transactions or behavior in store, however, and Ping Me If can help.
Users customize this app to create notifications given specific parameters you choose. Perhaps you want to know whenever a cashier process a refund or return? You can also be notified when cash is removed from the drawer, an item is deleted from inventory, and a multitude of other events or actions.
You can’t be everywhere at once, but you can stay informed about what’s happening in your business whether you are there or not.
HR Resources by Homebase
If you have a small business, chances are you don’t have an HR department. In all likelihood, you are the HR department. HR Resources helps to streamline this aspect of your business by storing forms to on-board new employees, organizing reviews to keep existing staffers engaged, and more.
HR Resources allow you to access job description templates, and customize them for your individual needs. They also have a series of webcasts to offer support for more complicated issues like employee insurance, curbing employee theft, and best practices for employee retention.
Time Clock by Homebase
Time Clock streamlines staffing and scheduling like no other app available. The iOS/Android version of the app allows staffers to swap shifts, get reminders before shifts, and much more. If things are busy and you need more bodies on deck, you can send out a quick message via Time Clock offering bonus shifts for available staffers.
Time Clock even manages the tracking cash tips, time off requests, and payroll-ready timesheet reports. This is an app no business should be without.

No matter the nature of your business, you are guaranteed to face challenges. Clover is here to help. Check out these and other apps available in the Clover App Market to help your business thrive.

From updated payment regulations to the iPhone losing its headphone jack, keeping up with the breakneck pace of innovation can be daunting. No one understands this better than First Data: every day, we help our six million merchant clients navigate everything from EMV to accepting payments digitally.
That’s why today we are announcing the availability of our new all-in-one Clover Go. Unlike other card readers that need a separate device to accept credit or debit card swipes, our reader is the only fully integrated card reader that accepts NFC, EMV and mag stripe transactions all in one sleek device. Better yet, the reader is able to process EMV transactions in less than 3.5 seconds, making it twice as fast as our previous Clover Go solution.

So whether your customers want to tap their smartphone, dip a chip card or swipe a debit or credit card to check out, they can do it all with the all-in-one Clover Go. From Apple Pay® to Android Pay™ and Samsung Pay™ to whatever else comes down the road, we’ve got you covered. Even better, the reader comes with Bluetooth functionality – meaning headphone jack or not, you can accept your customers’ payments safely and securely.
“The all-in-one Clover Go is great not only because it’s easy to use, but also because it provides our customers with a quick and convenient check out experience,” said Neng Nhayi Ly, owner of California-based Le Rendez-Vous French Bakery, who uses the all-in-one Clover Go both in-store and at local farmer’s markets. “When I’m out at a farmer’s market, I feel confident that I can securely accept my customers’ payments – even better, it fits in my pocket,” Nhayi Ly added.
Our Clover Go app has also been updated to seamlessly integrate with our other Clover products, meaning a transaction can begin on any Clover device and finish on either the all-in-one Clover Go or the original Clover Go reader. For example, a restaurant receiving a delivery order by phone can start a transaction on their Clover Station and complete it at their customer’s doorstep with the reader, facilitating a simple, in-person transaction.
In addition to open order functionality, the updated Clover Go app version includes:

Support for the new contactless, chip and swipe reader
Support for the Clover terminal plan, meaning existing Clover merchants using the terminal plan can bundle in the all-in-one Clover Go without creating a new merchant ID or upgrading to the register plan
Ability to control inventory items displayed in-app with “show-in register”
Availability of in-app troubleshooting and device diagnostics
Access to web-based apps from the Clover App Market
As always, Clover Go has the ability to function as a standalone POS or with the full Clover product suite and provides live phone support from service reps

All-in-one Clover Go users also benefit from the same features inherent in the Clover Go solution announced at the beginning of this year. The multi-user functionality allows a restaurant operating in sports stadiums to have their employees accept payments in the stands, while the business owner tracks real-time sales from her counter. Clover Go also contains an “entitlement” feature that lets the business owner grant permissions to certain employees like managers. For example, a business owner may want only senior employees to have the ability to offer refunds.
Check out the video above to see the new all-in-one Clover Go in action.

Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
The holidays can be boom times for businesses of all sizes, but for small business owners, the holidays are often also an incredibly high-stress time of year.
That’s because preparing to have a great holiday season, and then doing the work necessary to make the season pay off, calls for mindful goal setting, resource assessment and contingency planning.
It also means organizing your equipment, inventory and staff to keep up with demand; promoting your business at a time when everyone is turning up the volume on marketing; preparing for a customer onslaught; and sometimes securing the financing necessary to do any or all of the above.
Over the next few weeks, we’ll be publishing separate articles about how to handle each of these challenges and opportunities. But as October winds down, let’s take a tour of the planning categories small merchants need think about so they can begin to organize before the holiday shopping season gets underway.
First, set smart holiday goals
Perhaps the most important first step you can take for your holiday planning is to figure out what you’d like your business to accomplish.
Doing this helps you create a roadmap for a successful holiday season, and has the added benefit of being helpful even if you don’t quite hit all of your targets. That’s because smart goal setting can help you make sense of detours and roadblocks to hitting your holiday business goals, which can help you make better business decisions in the future.
One of the best ways to set smart goals is to have a handle on customer transactions. In addition to being the all-important actions that drive commerce for your business, they also play an important secondary role as highly useful information. Understanding when transactions occur, by whom and for what products can offer merchants useful insight into what makes their business succeed. This can also help you make wise decisions about the actions you should take in order to achieve your business goals.
For the holidays, this can mean stocking what sells best in your location, understanding what customer behaviors are trending with consumers in your area, knowing how to staff up during your most profitable hours and days, and knowing where you should market and what messages to use.
Be prepared to manage customer security
The sheer volume of transactions that take place during the holidays make it an especially vulnerable time both for customers and for the businesses that transact with them. Bad actors can use a number of gateways to defraud consumers, and credit card transactions are one of the primary ones. Breaching merchants is an efficient way for fraudsters to skim money from unsuspecting shoppers. According to a June 2016 report by the Ponemon Institute, more than half of small to medium businesses have had a data breach in the past year.
Protecting your consumers, yourself and your reputation should be a top priority. The holidays are as good a time as any to start forming good security habits, or to give yourself a security health check if you’ve already been diligent about security. Educate yourself and your staff on security best practices, and create a response plan in the case of security breaches. One way to start: make sure that you’re PCI compliant.
Of course, working with a partner that already offers security software and services is a great way to make sure you’re doing the most to secure transactions and customer data. Clover, for example, offers Clover Security Plus, which helps protect the hardware and software involved with customer transactions, in addition to securing the transactions themselves.
Consider offering an online store to increase sales opportunities and grow your customer base
Shopping for goods online has become a part of consumers’ muscle memory. According to a Forrester Research report published in January 2016, online retail will grow by an average of 9.32% every year through 2020. Having an online store is worth considering for retail-focused small businesses.
Just remember: when you create a website, make sure it adapts well to mobile so that customers have a great experience even when using their mobile devices. The same Forrester report predicted mobile would “be a key driver” of ecommerce sales growth. You should also make sure your online system is tied to your brick-and-mortar store so that your inventory is accounted for no matter how you make a sale.
Grow your customer base by offering gift cards
At $100 billion spent on gift cards annually, they are a major part of the shopping economy all by themselves. They’re also a favorite with consumers: gift cards were the most requested holiday gift, according to the National Retail Federation, for nine years in a row ending in 2015.
Offering cards is a great way for small businesses to get onto holiday shoppers’ giving list. They’re also a tactic you can use to better manage inventory through the holidays, as gift cards are typically given at the end of the holiday season, and then redeemed thereafter. Add to that the fact that customers often spend more than the amount gifted, and they become an even more valuable tool in a small business’s holiday planning arsenal.
Lastly, use gift cards as a way to keep dollars circulating within your store. To do this, you can offer gift cards instead of cash spent for returns, and offer gift cards for in-store promotions if customers spend over a certain dollar amount with you during the holiday shopping season.
Extend your holiday efforts with loyalty
Loyalty programs are smart all on their own. Repeat customers spend an average of 67% more than new customers, so creating an incentive for repeat customers is a great way to boost revenue for your business. Having a loyalty program during the holidays carries a specific set of benefits in three distinct ways.
First, launching a customer loyalty program before the holiday shopping season will make it easier for your business to break through the holiday marketing noise when the season gets underway. Being eligible for holiday shopping deals based on their previous spending can motivate existing consumers to spend with you.
Second, loyalty-based events can offer a sound way for you to “make your own luck” in terms of getting traffic through your door for holiday season spending, and small businesses of all kinds can create these types of moments.
For example, a boutique might invite loyalty customers to a fashion show or preview; a coffee shop can invite customers to a coffee tasting to sample and vote on a new specialty brew; and retail businesses of all stripes can offer VIP after-hours sales, or secret online sales if they have an ecommerce store.
Third, starting a customer loyalty program during the holiday shopping season can set you up to bring holiday shoppers back in to spend loyalty points — or get credit for a shopping session — when January rolls around. If one of your goals is to use the holidays to create a bump in your regular customer base, launching a loyalty program during this time is one effective to do it.

Every business owner knows they need to do it, yet finding the time and resources to get the right marketing mix is challenging. Just ask Christopher Barber, Chief Nerd at Cheaper Than a Geek. He’s tried almost everything including some very expensive mistakes.

Marketing doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, it’s 5 times more expensive to get new customers than it is to keep and nurture existing customers. Here are 5 ideas for getting more sales from your current customer base.
Nurture New Customers 
Encourage repeat business. Send special offers via email to existing customers. Email is still king for nurturing existing clients into repeat business. If it’s been a long time since they made a purchase, send them a note with a discount saying they are missed. Know the perfect item to complement what they already bought? Send an email suggesting it. With marketing software like MailChimp or Constant Contact it’s easy to set up automated email nurturing campaigns. Abreeze Link apps send transaction and customer information from the Clover point-of-sale system directly to MailChimp or Constant Contact, so email offers go out effortlessly once set up.
Give Awesome Perks to Loyal Customers
No one wants a dusty punch card they have to remember to bring to get their rewards. Keep customers happy by sending instant rewards to customers’ phones or share them with followers on social media. Customers will feel they are getting rewarded for every purchase. Need help getting started? Clovers Rewards makes it easy.
Delight Unhappy Customers
Leave a bad impression on a recent customer? Smooth things over before they complain on Yelp or Google. Convert the dissatisfied customers into evangelists and they are not only more likely to come back, they are more likely to tell other customers how impressed they were with the service. Clover’s Feedback App allows unhappy customers to give immediate, private feedback via a unique code on their receipt so that you can respond quickly. Make these customers feel important and heard. Replace defective products or address their concerns. This kind of personal attention pays dividends later on.
Find Out What Customers Really Want and Give It to Them
Customer surveys can be a veritable font of great ideas. When competition is fierce, subtle differences in service, products, or even atmosphere can make one store a favorite. Discover what customers really think. Clover’s Customer Survey app allows customers to activate a QR code on their receipt to take a fun, interactive survey on their phone. Results are emailed to merchants immediately. The best part—merchants only pay only for completed surveys.
Be Social and Encourage Word of Mouth Marketing
While it’s every business’s dream to have enthusiastic customers raving about them in social media, constantly updating different social media feeds can be time-consuming without software. Clover’s BeSocial app helps businesses send promotions to Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare, Yelp, and Google right from their point-of-sale device.
Start a social strategy by giving customers a reason to connect—offer special promotions only to followers. Then get followers excited and talking about a business with social media contests, like a makeover challenge or suggesting new specials. Encourage customers to share promotions and campaigns. With Clover’s app merchants can schedule posts in advance or send them out live. With every like, share, or comment, a store is marketed to customers’ friends and family.

Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
For many retailers, the holiday season is still a pivotal time of year with nearly 20% of annual retail sales occurring between Black Friday and Christmas. This holiday season the National Retail Federation is projecting an increase in holiday spending of 3.6% to $655.8 billion—a potential 10-year high! Competition for those holiday dollars is fierce, though, so planning out a holiday marketing strategy ahead of time is crucial. Here are some tips to get started on the right track.
Focus on unique quality, not steep discounts.
Don’t get caught up in the hype of deep discounting. Yes, in the short term, it may yield higher sales, but predictable steep discounts really just train customers to wait for outrageously low prices. This devalues the products and services in the long-term. Instead, focus holiday promotions on the idea that products are worth full price—indulgences that make the perfect gifts.
Know the bottom line numbers.
While it’s tempting to match competitor’s prices, don’t sacrifice profits for the sake of getting the sale. Before the season kicks off, identify limits for bottom line prices while still making your numbers. This will inform better business decisions throughout the holiday season.
Identify a promotional schedule.
A typical holiday promotion schedule is shown below, but it can and should be adapted for the specific needs of a given business or service.

Pre-Season Sale: Christmas decorations and other seasonal items can now be seen as early as Halloween.
Pre-Thanksgiving sale: Many customers want a good deal, but won’t brave the Black Friday Crowds. Try to entice them with a pre-Thanksgiving sale.
Black Friday Sale: While November 25th, 2016, is technically Black Friday this year, most stores will extend their Black Friday sales from Thanksgiving through to Cyber Monday.
Cyber Monday Sale: November 28, 2016
Bounce-Back Tuesday: November 29, 2016
Christmas-Eve Sales: December 24, 2016
Post-Christmas/ New Year’s Sales

Determine the marketing mix.
Once promotional prices and schedules are set, determine the marketing mix. Consider sending out postcards, emails, and providing coupons at the register, as all will have different impacts. Social media is also a great tool for notifying loyal followers of specials and promotions. Figuring out the best channels to advertise promotions will help in mapping out the full promotions plan.
Be familiar with marketing tools.
Clover has a full suite of marketing apps to make the holidays a little easier. When offering special promotions to your loyal customers, reaching out through social media, sending emails or SMS text messages, Clover has you covered. Check out our app marketplace and learn about the apps available for use this holiday season.

Who better to talk about innovation in an evolving marketplace?
For small businesses, coming up with new, useful ideas is essential for attracting customers and improving operations. Innovating day-to-day tasks can also carve out time for big-picture concerns, such as new products and new directions.
“The main thing that keeps us constantly innovating and looking for ways to do things better is this incredibly long list of projects we have,” says Dan Goldman, co-founder of Panyl, a DIY furniture coverings company. “Unless we’re on top of all our processes, we can’t free up time to innovate and change the business.”

External pressure is one way to get the creative juices moving. Another reliable yet underused source of inspiration is to look at sales numbers. Concrete facts are the foundation of idea generation.
Tracking daily and extended figures about what’s moving, what’s not, and how nearby competitors are doing can pinpoint problems and jumpstart thinking about solutions and opportunities.
Spot buying trends and accelerate the momentum.
Clover Insights collects real-time data and reformats it into easy-to-read charts and graphs. These visual snapshots—viewable on the Clover dashboard, or any smartphone or computer—show top-earning products, customers’ favorite items, and revenue over time.
A quick survey of customer buying habits can spark questions: Should popular items be moved to more visible locations? Are diners gravitating to new product categories? Is it time to come up with fresh menu items? What if you created your own version of a popular product and boosted profit margins?
Find gaps in the daily revenue picture and fix them.
The Insights app highlights the busiest hours and days of the week, as well as the slowest. Does revenue pick up in the afternoon when school lets out? Is the morning coffee rush the primary source of sales? How can you fill the gaps? Are there promotional offers you can create? Would gift cards work? Could you host events at your location and build word of mouth in the community?
Locate ways to lift sales during slumps.
Big sales slowdowns can wreck a business’s finances. Are seasonal slumps dragging down profits? Are there other recurring times of the year when traffic and sales dip? What can you do to combat it? What about going mobile with a food truck or pop up, offering online ordering, or shifting to the business to a web store? Dashboards help merchants focus on ongoing problems and troubleshoot solutions.
Find out what competitors are doing and improve on it.
Is the whole neighborhood slow, or just you? Heat maps offer answers. They show how a business is doing compared to others in the area, and clarify whether your revenue is growing and shrinking with the neighborhood—or not. What are competitors doing to bring customers in? Can you improve on their formula, while still maintaining your identity?
Identify customers’ pain points and find solutions.
Clover Insights tells you how many new and returning customers visit your business each week. Are there many who don’t come back? Are you losing customers too quickly? Think about why that might be happening. Maybe lines are too long, or the merchandise is losing its appeal? Is the customer experience lagging? How can you fix it?

Analyzing sales data provides hard evidence of where the weak spots are. By targeting problems, small business owners can innovate ways to improve and grow.

Ever wish you could know how to increase sales before investing in a product, promotion, or new location? With good data, anything is possible. Clover Insights offers inside information on what’s working (or not working) for your competition.
Simply enter your store information, choose an industry, and compare notes. Here are 7 ideas on how to learn from the competition:
Investigate locations
Using Insights to enter information on industry and area to find your local competition. Check out their aggregate sales data: This provides valuable information on whether a geographic area is potentially lucrative or a dud before you branch out into a new location.

Diagnose problem areas
Look at your revenue in Insights and compare it to the competition. Identify days or seasons where sales should be higher: How is your business doing in a typical day, week, month, or year? Are there seasonal dips? What’s your slowest day? More important, how does it compare it to the competition in the same area? Should your sales be higher, comparably speaking, in those time periods? If so, consider offering a promotion during slow periods to bring in more business.

Research product ideas
If business is booming in some months, but anemic in others, investigate new industries that might help stabilize your revenue flow. For example, a resort clothing store may have exceptional business in the summer months, but may be very slow in the winter. Choose related industries in Clover Insights in your geographic area like shoe stores, jewelry stores, or gift shops. Do any of these businesses have steady revenue throughout the year? Is the revenue in winter months better with, say, clothing stores? If so, perhaps offering those products could make it worth your while to stay open all year.

Identify upselling opportunities
Clover Insights might reveal that your competition is doing better in terms of overall revenue, but they have fewer transactions than you and a larger ticket size. This suggests they either charge more for their products, or are successfully upselling customers into a higher dollar-value sale. What products are they selling that could be a growth opportunity for you, too? Ask customers if they would consider purchasing those products from you.

Define your value proposition
Ask customers when they come in: who did they buy from before and why did they decide to purchase from you today? Visit your competition and ask your fellow shoppers there similar questions—“This is my first time here. What do you like about shopping here?” These questions often reveal your value proposition and how you (and your competition) are viewed by customers.
Hit the pavement
In comparing revenue, which businesses consistently outperform others even in slow periods? Businesses that do significantly better should top the list of competitors to investigate and are worth an in-store reconnaissance mission. Figure out their busiest time of day and plan your attack. The mission: answer these questions:

What promotions are they running?
Are there perks to shopping there (free drinks?)
What do they do to encourage repeat business (Coupons? Loyalty programs?)
Do they advertise via social media (and are you following them)?
Why are customers buying from them? Strike up a conversation with another customer: “I’ve never been here before—are the sandwiches any good? What do you recommend?” You’d be surprised how much information can be gleaned with simple questions.

Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
The holiday season is a crucial time for many small businesses: almost 20% of all retail sales take place during the holiday season, according to the National Retail Federation. Savvy small business owners have probably been preparing for the season for months—setting goals, reviewing last year’s performance, and planning any special promotions.
An upfront investment now could pay off big in this busy season—but only if you have the cash on hand to make that investment. Here are five questions to ask yourself to figure out if you need financing to tackle this holiday season:
1. How much will I need to spend on marketing?
You may need extra cash to spend on special promotions, but make sure those marketing dollars go as far as possible. Social media is a free and relatively easy way to let people know about seasonal promotions.
If you already have a loyalty program, you can use that to help boost foot traffic. Using an app like Promos, from the Clover App Market, you can push discounts, one-day sales, and other promotions right to your loyal customers’ mobile phones. And an analytics program like Clover Insights could help you see where most of your customers live, so you can focus your advertising on specific neighborhoods.
2. Do I need to increase production capacity?
If you’re going to be pumping out hundreds of extra cookies for the holidays, or running promotions that will draw in a lot of new customers demanding lattes, you might need extra equipment. Look at last year’s sales to see whether you might need to lease another espresso machine or even rent some extra space.
3. Will I be selling more inventory?
Analytics are crucial here. What sold best last year? Programs like Clover Insights can show you exactly what sold, when. That way you can stock up now on your most popular products. You could even create a gift guide to steer customers towards whatever you have on hand. Gift cards can also help you manage your inventory—you’ll get some cash up front that you can use to stock up on product.
4. Should I invest in technology?
When your stores get busy, the last thing you want is a long line holding things up. Make sure you’ve got the state-of-the-art, efficient tech solutions you need to keep things running smoothly.
E-commerce is also an increasingly important part of the holiday season. The National Retail Federation expects online holiday sales to increase as much as 10% this year. Setting up an online store doesn’t have to be expensive or time-consuming. For example, the Sell Online app from the Clover App Market can help you set up an online store quickly and easily, for only $50 a month.
5. Do I need more staff?
There’s no doubt that the holiday season is a busy one. But taking on extra staff is a big—and possibly expensive—decision. Look carefully at the analytics for last year’s holiday season. Clover Insights can help you figure out if you can change staffing patterns to meet increased demand, rather than actually hiring new people. Apps like Timeclock from Homebase can help you, and your employees, manage a demanding schedule. Employees can check their schedules on the go, and if the schedule needs to change, they can be alerted with a text message.
If you do need financing to help meet the needs of a busy season, there are plenty of options. A bank loan or line of credit is often a reliable, affordable choice. Alternative online lenders can get you cash quickly. Businesses that process payments through First Data can also take advantage of Clover’s cash advance program. You could get up to 100% of your monthly average credit card sales—and the cash could be in your account in just a few days.
In our “5 Questions” series, we boil down the questions you should ask and answer to help you make the right calls as you run your business.

Small business owners are some of the busiest people there are, and their schedules are full of essential tasks to do or oversee. Because of this, performing tasks outside of what is required to keep their businesses running might feel like a luxury.
But there are a number of business activities that, while they fall outside of the realm of essential day-to-day work, should still be high up on the list of things small businesses need to do in order to win. One of those activities is finding, and making sense of, data about how businesses around them are performing, and understanding what basic customer behaviors are driving that performance.
Here’s why having this information is no longer a luxury for small businesses.
You need data in order to run fast in the right direction
There’s no way around working hard to make your small businesses successful. But it’s important to make sure your and your team’s efforts are going towards the right goals, and that you’re pulling the right levers to hit them.
Understanding the basic behaviors that drive commerce for similar businesses near you — like how many credit card transactions they process, and how much average customers are spending — can help you wrap your mind around what your business needs to do in order to stay on par, and even exceed, your competition’s performance.
Knowing this information can help you prioritize your daily operations: should you focus on getting more employees to handle higher volume, or on training employees to upsell on more expensive inventory? Should you add coffee to your menu to appeal to a broader base of customers, or would it be better to go with pastries? Making these decisions based on data, and not assumptions, makes it more likely that your hard work will actually help you increase revenue.
There are now many more fronts in the battle for customers
Insights into what’s working for different types of local businesses can help you size up your competition, enable you to benchmark your performance, and empower you to understand what’s possible for your business.
Small businesses need this type of data now more than ever. Competition isn’t a new reality for small businesses, but technology is making it easier for consumers to consider your business alongside your competition. Small businesses that serve local clientele are competing not only for foot traffic, but also competing on social media, online rating sites, and in delivery services. Having a sharp understanding of how competitors are performing is becoming a basic matter of survival for small businesses.
Competitive data is easier to get than ever
There was a time when getting your hands on business insights–and in particular data about local businesses–was tricky and expensive, if it was possible at all.
That’s not the case anymore. Clover, for example, offers a free app that lets small businesses see revenue and customer volume data for different types of businesses in their area, in addition to apps for Clover customers that show a detailed view of their own customers’ habits. Facebook and Google’s advertising modules let local businesses get a sense of consumer preferences, demographics and interests, all the way down to the zip code, and for free.
Having this type of data so widely accessible, and in some cases free, presents businesses with an unprecedented opportunity to better understand their local competitive environment. And with their competitors able to easily access the same information, using this data might quickly move from being a competitive advantage to business-as-usual.
Wise business owners will make this a habit now.

Read all posts in the series here on the Clover blog.
Understanding basic concepts behind revenue and expenses can help small businesses make more profitable marketing decisions.
Total sales are comprised of three variables: the number of customers, the average amount spent per transaction, and the frequency that each customer purchases an item. As businesses think about strategies for increasing their revenue, they should break down these strategies to one or more of these variables to see which of them has the best chance of driving up overall revenue.
Increasing customer volume
The more customers a business has, the higher sales will be. In light of this, there are standard ways to increase customer volume such as:
1. Tap local markets. Foot traffic and nearby office complexes can be great resources to grow a customer base. Flyers, hawkers, signage and music are great ways to catch people’s attention and draw them inside.
2. Try new promotions. Promotions can help pull in traffic by offering deals worth stopping in for. For specific ideas, check out 5 Simple and Inexpensive Marketing Tips.
A less obvious way to increase volume is to improve business efficiency. Faster lines are attractive to customers, especially during rush or peak hours. There are several ways to do this:
3. Increase staff. Coffee shops that offer quick service in the morning before work are more likely to attract and keep loyal customers. Consider whether the cost of an extra person or two during your two-hour peak time will enable you to do enough business to justify the cost of staffing up.
4. Expand revenue per unit of space. Restaurants with more tables can accommodate more customers during the dinner hour. This is true for any service industry, such as more stations at a hair salon.
5. Add more ways to buy. Curbside pickup, self-service kiosks, preordering food, online check-in, or even online sales are several ways a business can increase efficiency and, therefore, increase the number of customers they service. Think about how much capacity you’ll need to add in order to take advantage of each of these tools.
Increase the Average Ticket Size
Ticket size is the average amount customers spend with each visit or transaction. The most obvious way to increase ticket size is to increase prices, but that can backfire especially in businesses that are very price-sensitive. Here are a few other ideas to increase the amount each customer spends.
6. Feature more profitable items prominently. Restaurants can feature items like high-margin cocktails, wines and desserts. Retail stores can feature profitable items prominently in window or floor displays and in promotions.
7. Display impulse items near check-out. Catch customers when they are in the buying mood by featuring small, but attractive items right as they are paying.
8. Train staff to upsell. The best sales staff ask questions to find out more about the customer and why they are making a purchase decision. Knowing the problem a customer is trying to solve helps you sell more and offer a more customized, customer-focused experience.
9. Encourage staff to cross-sell items. Is it a gift? Perhaps they need a gift card or wrapping paper. Does that dress match a belt or earrings? Do they want a croissant with their coffee? Maybe they’d like a flavor added to their drink. Do they need socks or shoe cleaner for their new shoes? Whatever they are buying, point out obvious additions to their purchase.
10. Bundle items to increase the likelihood of buying more. Bundling items suggests combinations customers might not have thought of and subtly encourages them to buy more. Instead of offering free drinks at a bar, offer beer buckets with ice for a small additional fee or finger food. Offer a cheese pairing with a wine tasting, or perhaps a taster dish meant to be shared with small amounts of each dessert. Bundle Discounts and other bundling apps can help set up this kind of promotion easily.
Increase the Frequency of Sales
A third way to increase overall sales is to encourage current customers to make purchases more often. Punch Card Rewards and other loyalty programs aren’t the only way to increase the frequency of sales. Here are a few other ways to increase the frequency of sales:
11. Offer monthly subscription services. Determine whether any of your products or services could be offered as a monthly subscription service. Massage Therapy, for example, offers a monthly rate that encourages customers to think of their services as a wellness strategy, not a once-in-awhile luxury item. Cafes can offer something healthy like a daily vitamin smoothie or a heart-healthy lunch special.
12. Reward early service. For services that are known repeats, encourage customers to come in early. For example, women who color their hair typically come back 6 weeks later to treat their roots. Salons can encourage them to come in week 4 instead of waiting a full 6 weeks. If they consistently do this the salon will get 4 more sales over the course of a year.
13. Organize and remind customers. Simplify your customers’ lives by helping them organize their purchases and plan ahead. For example, instead of waiting until taxes are due, accountants can offer a monthly financial check in with customers. Not only will this spread business into off-peak time periods, it may be a service customers are willing to pay more for. Birthday reminder emails are a great way for florists and other businesses to get repeat business.

Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
The problem: You’re not maximizing revenue within your retail space.
 The possibility: Buddy up with another business.
When it comes to running a small business, proprietors know there’s one cost that towers over all others when it’s time to do accounts payable: the monthly lease payment.
Essential—by definition—to restaurant and retail businesses, having a physical space in which to meet and serve your customers makes many of the new, trendy business models like food trucks or pop-up shops out of reach for those who’ve chosen to stake their claim to a corner on Main Street, USA and build a business from the ground up.
But what if those niche models weren’t so out of the question for small businesses with physical storefronts?
We’re talking about colocation: the idea that instead of trying to keep other businesses and their customers out of your showroom, you invite them in via some mutually beneficial arrangement, whether it be a single evening event, a seasonal consignment, or a long term sub-lease of some space on your floor.
Below, we’ve outlined a few scenarios for your consideration. Perhaps now is the time to ask yourself if a colocation arrangement is right for your business.
Seasonal Pop-ups
For those not quite sure if a long term partnership on space is right for their business, starting out with a seasonal “pop-up” shop is a good way to test the waters—especially during a part of the year when business is slow. Think bringing in an artisan soup chef with gourmet grilled sandwiches to your ice cream shop during the winter. Or custom mountain bike gear and maintenance to a ski shop in summer.
Key consideration(s): What’s my business’ personality? And that of a potential partner business? Do they mesh well?
Copacetic Clientele
Another avenue to colocation bliss is partnering with a very different kind of business that serves the same clientele. Washington, D.C. business Busboys & Poets has opened multiple locations across the city by offering D.C.’s arthouse crowd a restaurant, bookstore, lounge, and theater—all under one roof. Consider bringing in an artisan art supplier to your coffee shop, or vintage clothier to a hip salon.
Key consideration(s): Who’s my crowd? What other things do they enjoy? Emphasize psychographics more than traditional demographics when thinking about these partnership.
Location, Location, Location
The classical arbiter of value, the key to a mutually beneficial colocation arrangement could be where your business is situated. A central-city bar that draws an after work crowd but is a ghost town during breakfast and lunchtime hours might make a great co-working space—especially if said bar has history. The alt-weekly headline pretyt much writes itself: “Tech bros find cooperation, camaraderie in turn-of-the-century watering hole.”
Key consideration: What are the merits of my location? How might those characteristics attract a partner business?
Double Duty
It takes certain essential capital investments to get most small businesses off the ground, namely specialized machinery and equipment. And it’s often difficult to pay for all that equipment when first starting out as a new small business. So why not take advantage of that fact and rent that equipment (and the space it inhabits) to a fledgeling business in off hours? A daytime printshop could host nighttime printmaking classes or an independent, small-run publisher. Or a brisk weekend brunch spot could act as a commercial prep kitchen for food trucks during the weekdays off.
Key consideration(s): What else can my equipment make? Who else can it serve?
Innerspace
Perhaps one of the best known, yet still underutilized, colocation strategies is monetizing those unused nooks and crannies. Whether that means providing shelf space to house a local artisan’s wares, or allowing a favorite artist to hang their work on your restaurant’s walls, sharing your space with businesses of this kind can bring an interesting aesthetic to the table and a few extra dollars to your pocketbook. Or you could rent that unused show room or loading dock out back for fashion or music events. It’s up to you to realize the untapped potential of your space.
Key consideration(s): Who in community needs space to sell product/service and doesn’t have it?

news_98,news,5 questions to ask before adopting a new social media platform,"Starting and engaging in social media is free, but building and maintaining a strong social following can be time consuming. Businesses should carefully consider a platform before diving in.…",30-11-2016,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/should-my-business-adopt-this-social-media-platform/,"This post is part of our “5 questions” series, helping merchants ask the right questions before making key business decisions. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
Pew Research reports that nearly two-thirds of the United States population is active on social media, making it an intriguing way to increase word-of-mouth marketing and get more exposure for small businesses. Starting and engaging in social media is free, but building and maintaining a strong social following can be time consuming. Businesses should carefully consider a platform before diving in.
Here are five questions businesses should ask and answer before starting a presence on a social media platform.
1. Do we have a dedicated resource to post unique content at least three times a week?
According to Business Insider, only about 25 percent of Twitter users log into their account at least once a month. Carefully consider whether you have the time or resources to keep up a cadence of posts that are tailored to the platform you’re using. Adopt a platform only if you have the resources and strategy to use it on a regular basis.
2. Will this social media platform reach my target audience?
Consider the demographics of each social media platform and whether it represents your target audience. According to Pew Research, Facebook is used by 71 percent of American adults, including 56 percent of internet users aged 65 and up. The same study shows the Twitter population to be slightly younger, more college educated and more often living in urban areas, whereas Pinterest tends to attract more women, especially ones who are interested in arts, crafts and cooking.
Know your target demographics and determine which social channel they are likely to engage in. (Need help on determining your target audience? Here are 8 steps to get you started.)
3. Is my content strategy ready to launch?
Each social platform is subtly unique with its own tone, demographics and type of content that works best. Using the exact same content on Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram is not going to work well.
Before signing up for a social platform, determine the goals of your social campaigns, who you’re trying to reach, what is most likely to interest them and what type of content will work best in that channel. Develop a plan on what to post and how frequently. Will you post daily lunch specials? Photos of fans? Featured merchandise? Quotes that convey your brand’s character? What content is most likely to engage your customers, and what is your plan for creating that content on a consistent basis?

4. Will this platform help us generate leads in a trackable way?
Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin are great because they can feature links showing engagement, click-throughs, and even which customers purchase products online. Instagram is highly visible, but can’t include clickable links in individual posts and is therefore harder to track.
Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin offer paid promotions, or “sponsored content,” to help you get in front of new customers. Instagram also allows you to advertise, but does so through Facebook’s self-serve interface. Facebook and Linkedin can be very effective at generating leads and building up your email lists. Think about what your goals are for each social network, and whether you’ll get the information required to tell you that you’re succeeding,
5. Will this platform help us “own” the lead?
Having a large following on social media is great, but consider that a short-term goal. Although customers can “follow” your business, your posts won’t necessarily show in their feed. Or they could abandon their account or move to a new social platform.
Building a following should be the first step toward a long-term goal such as building up your contact database. Ultimately you’ll want full contact information so you can reach customers and prospects through other marketing channels. Consider how social media helps you build “owned” assets like email and postal mailing lists, or downloads of your own mobile app. Clover apps, such as Promos, can help you collect contact information for customers and build up your mailing lists.
In our “5 Questions” series, we boil down the questions you should ask and answer to help you make the right calls as you run your business.

Explore more better business tips and tactics here on the Clover blog.
In general, the calendar presents most businesses with a number of opportunities to make a good impression on the public and be festive while drawing in customers to their store or shop. From Valentine’s Day to Independence Day, Halloween and the holiday season, each year offers businesses multiple opportunities to roll out the red carpet, put on some festive music, and clear inventory with a half-off sale.
But if holidays are the only times of the year a business is leveraging what’s going on in the world to bring customers into the store, they’re missing out on many of the other kinds of events that happen in a community—meaning missed opportunities to capture surges of new revenue and missed opportunities to expose the business to a high concentration of new customers.
Whether your city is hosting something as large as the Super Bowl or part of the NCAA tournament, or your shop is located along a parade route or fun run, being ready to take advantage of the opportunities—and all the new faces—an event brings can mean big things for your small business. Below, we offer some tips on how to get ready for the big day, whatever that day is:
Be prepared.
One of the biggest parts of being ready for an event is actually knowing an event is happening. That means getting on local chamber, government, and news mailing lists to stay aware of events. Follow local media outlets (alt-weekly papers, radio stations, etc.) on social media to stay aware of more underground and eclectic events that might be happening in your area.
Buddy up.
When something big is happening in the neighborhood, it might be a good idea to partner with neighbor businesses, block associations, and suppliers to pool marketing and operations resources, increase capacity, and generally share the load on event day.
Know the rules.
Sometimes big events like Super Bowl, NBA or NCAA finals, and the World Series have special rules for vendors doing business near the event. Know those rules inside and out to ensure everything stays up and humming on the big day.
Know who’s coming.
It’s important you’re aware of exactly who is coming to any event so you’re able to shift marketing and offerings accordingly. For example, how you talk to the Knitting Guild Association conference attendees will be very different than NASCAR fans. Know your audience.
Plan logistics.
It’s important to schedule plenty of time to setup and teardown. Consider practice runs and having hour-by-hour action plans (like when to replenish ice, schedule breaks, etc.), as well as beefing up on additional management resources and workers.
Capture new customers.
Big events bring plenty of new faces into your business—-make sure you capture them as customers. Push your loyalty program, hand out fliers with a discount for online purchases, or create special-edition merchandise to increase revenue opportunities and keep those new customers as customers in the future.
Go small.
If your shop isn’t exactly close to the event, consider taking your show on the road and being a vendor at the event itself. There are a number of affordable mobile POS solutions that offer the flexibility and mobility of a smartphone with the security of a traditional point of sale.

Whether an event is large or small, the key to making the most of whatever might come is to be prepared. By keeping your finger on the pulse of your neighborhood and city, you can be ready, to take advantage of the many new faces, and capture the revenue that comes along with them, that an event might bring.

Welcome to our monthly roundup of research small businesses can use to do business better.
When consumers shop for gifts:

Consumers embraced the official start of the holiday shopping season. In 2016, more than 154 million people shopped over the Thanksgiving weekend, an increase of 3 million from last year. National Retail Federation Thanksgiving Weekend Survey
44 percent of shoppers made purchases online, while 40 percent hit brick-and-mortar stores. Of those shopping in-store, 75 percent braved the Black Friday crowds to bargain hunt. National Retail Federation Thanksgiving Weekend Survey
In a respectful nod to Thanksgiving itself, just 7 percent of consumers headed to stores before 5 p.m. on the actual holiday, a steep 19 percent drop from last year. National Retail Federation Thanksgiving Weekend Survey
Small Business Saturday was a big hit amongst consumers: around 112 million bought something at a small business on the day after Black Friday, an uptick of 13 percent from 2015. National Federation of Independent Business and American Express
Cyber Monday continues to grow in popularity as well. Shoppers spent a record $3.39 billion online, a 10 percent increase from 2015. Adobe Digital Insights
Those picking up gift cards for presents tend to shop later in the holiday season. 39 percent of Americans plan to buy a gift card during the month of December; 26 percent of those anticipate procrastinating and making their purchase right before Christmas. Bankrate Money Pulse Survey

What to know for the coming year

Almost half (45 percent) of small businesses already use social media to promote a product or service, with Facebook as the most popular platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Instagram round out the top five). SCORE Since 78 percent of consumers report being influenced by social media, small businesses should increase their use of the various platforms in 2017. PwC
Next year, digital gift cards will continue to grow in popularity. In 2015, 69 percent of merchants gave consumers this option; this year, that number grew to 72 percent. The offerings will increase in quality as well, with more businesses giving customers the ability to choose the dollar amount to load on the card, to pick from numerous designs, to schedule delivery, and to print it out at home. GiftCards.com
Group giving—where multiple people contribute towards the purchase of a gift card for one person—is anticipated to continue growing in popularity. Currently, 41 percent of people report being interested in this option. Retail Gift Card Association
Adults spend an average of 5 hours each day using their smartphone. As mobile usage continues to rise, SMBs will need to respond accordingly with mobile friendly sites and apps. KPCB

“We’re proud to hit this important milestone – not only because it reflects the popularity of our Clover devices among business owners, but because it also represents the power of the Clover platform,” said Dan Charron, EVP of Global Business Solutions at First Data. “Through our open platform, we are making it possible for business owners to customize their point-of-sale device to go far beyond simply accepting payments, to playing a critical role in daily operations.”
Stephen’s new restaurant will feature several Clover devices, including Clover Stations, Clover Mobiles and the recently-debuted All-in-One Clover Go. The Clover devices will help keep traffic moving through the main dining room of the restaurant, as well as at the takeaway window. Stephen plans to use Clover Mobiles to ‘line bust’ and is also considering adopting order display screens for their kitchen.
The opening of the restaurant is a big change for Stephen, who until recently worked in the corporate world and is settling into his new life as a small business owner. With his partners, he is committed to creating a special experience for customers by sharing his passion for the tradition of barbecue.
For Stephen, BBQ has always been a part of his DNA. His mother is from Texas and his father is from Georgia, so it comes as no surprise that Stephen will serve pork and beef barbecue in both southern and Texan styles at his restaurant. According to Stephen, the key to great BBQ is wood smoke–he even sources pecan bark from his family’s farm in Central Georgia.
“We are excited to be the 500,000th Clover customer and can’t wait to use the devices,” said Stephen. “One of the reasons we decided on Clover is because we know it can grow with us, and that it can save my time in managing the business, freeing me up to do what I do best: great BBQ!”
Stephen and his partners have their eyes on growing the business well beyond the location that just opened, moving into catering and opening other locations. As DAS BBQ grows, Clover will continue to grow right alongside the business.

Read all posts in the series here on the Clover blog.
Today many retailers, from mom-and-pops to big box chains, are incorporating loyalty programs into their traditional marketing mix.  With 69% of Millennials engaging with a loyalty program and 70% of those being happy with those loyalty programs (Blackhawk Network, 2016) right now, it appears there is little sign of slowing down for the loyalty trend.
But with so many players getting into the action, and nearly 30% of Millennials rating “too many programs to keep track off” as one of the top three things they dislike about loyalty programs (Vantiv, 2016), some small businesses are going above and beyond to find creative ways to keep their most valuable customers coming back again and again in the form of special membership programs.
Membership programs go a step beyond traditional loyalty programs to excite and motivate long-term regulars, high-value clients, and potential regulars of both types by providing a special “elite” status to which customers can aspire.
By structuring and presenting these elite, often hush-hush, membership programs in creative ways, small businesses can provide incentives to these valuable customers that will drive additional spend and visit frequency, often to great effect.
Below, we’ve outlined a few membership program ideas small businesses are employing today:
1. Offer high-value customers first dibs.
Fashion retailers and restaurants can offer their most engaged customers special events to get a “first look” at a new season’s fashions before they go out on the floor, or a chance to sample new menu items, or a new menu entirely, before the general public. The benefits to businesses are two-fold: they delight a group of engaged customers who will rave to friends and co-workers about the wonderful event they attended, and they offer businesses the opportunity to do market research on what will be a success and what could be improved.
2. Set up a bottle club to entice connoisseurs.
Many oenophiles (wine lovers) and whiskey connoisseurs love the status and atmosphere offered by bottle club membership programs. In bottle clubs, customers pre-pay for a bottle that’s kept in a dedicated spot on the shop or bar’s premises. This is often behind the bar, but some proprietors go as far to offer these exclusive members secret entrances to exclusive lounges in which to drink. Word-of-mouth alone about the exclusive whiskey bar behind a false bookcase make these clubs a big success for many businesses.

3. Remix the restaurant experience with around-the-world/family/holiday dinners.
The pop-up restaurant trend has been exciting diners for several years now, but some restaurants are taking it a step beyond offering after-hours service to exclusive crowds.
Chefs pull out all the stops bringing in industry friends to serve off-menu exclusives of cuisine often a world away from the restaurant’s traditional faire. In addition, some are offering family-style dinners behind closed doors on holidays or other special occasions, allowing diners huge multi-course dinners in a more relaxed and creative setting.
4. Create a ‘Century Club’ to recognize your regulars
Somewhat more in the realm of the “neighborhood” bar or restaurant, century clubs offer the multi-times-per-week regular points for buying every product in a category or the most extreme item: offering customers special status for eating a giant plate of extra hot wings, over-sized burgers, drinking a beer from every tap, or visiting a certain number of times in a year—say 100—is enough for many customers to aspire to feats of consumption greatness.
In return, they’re offered a picture on the wall of fame, exclusive merch, a dedicated table, or other special perks that give them bragging rights among friends and family.
While a traditional loyalty program is very often a great first step to bringing back valuable repeat customers, membership programs are the way to take your loyalty marketing into the big leagues. Remember, making a membership program exclusive, the rewards valuable, and the experience creative, can pay dividends in terms of buzz and additional spend in a big way for today’s small businesses.

If you’re the proprietor of a bar or restaurant, you know you have a million things to juggle on any given day: inventory, staff, front and back of house. But amid all that chaos, you never take your focus off your products and service—and what they mean to your customers. Like right now, chances are you can easily name your top selling product. Go on—say it out loud. See how easy that was? Now, think about your strategy for using that product to grow your business. Might not come as easy. And that’s why you’re reading this article. Our goal here is to define the purpose of product strategy and highlight several different ways you can use it to improve your product offerings and help you craft more relevant marketing messages.
So, what is product strategy? In short, it’s creating or offering new products, or repackaging existing products, to better appeal to existing/new customers. In simpler terms, it’s taking your number one go-to (app, entrée, dessert, whatever), and finding a new angle to help it become even more attractive to your target audience. As you explore your product strategy, it’s important to keep an eye on your competitors and consumers. Why? Because your competitors are more than likely doing all they can via product strategy as well. And your customers’ response is the best way to tell if your evolved product strategy is working. They’re very vocal about change, whether good or bad.
According to Chron.com, there are three ways to approach product strategy, with each listed approach requiring a more aggressive attitude. As with anything business related, one size does not fit all. It’s important for you to take a deep dive into these approaches to find the one that works best for you, your customers and your goals.
Product modification
As the name implies, this strategy starts with an existing product and involves looking at ways to evolve it. Think of the “new and improved” formulas you see for foodstuffs all the time. For your restaurant, this may entail taking a product like chicken wings and finding an enhanced way to present them so as to continue to please existing fans of the dish while possibly capturing new users as well.
Product diversification
This is the proverbial practice of embracing new horizons. The focus here is on moving beyond your existing menu in an effort to develop a new product for a new market. McDonald’s is a master of this approach, trying everything from offering pizza to lobster rolls to complement their stalwart burger and fries menu. For you, this could mean adding a Mexican dish to an American menu or something similar. Again, just consider what would resonate most with your customers.
Read more: Marketing & Promotions tips and tactics
Revolutionary Product Development
As we mentioned earlier, this strategy requires the most aggressive attitude because it’s all about thinking outside of the box. Revolutionary products are those that fulfill a never before met need. Lay’s is a great example of this. They have a wildly popular stable of potato chips, but they’re constantly innovating new flavor profiles for their chips, and then actively marketing them and soliciting consumer feedback about the most popular. It has the potential to be a very successful roadmap for you to follow.
In closing, it’s clear that tapping insights is the way to help merchants like yourself implement these strategies. In order to maximize your product strategy, it’s imperative for you to glean insights from many different aspects of your restaurant, from your top-selling products to purchasing patterns of your VIP customers and more. Whatever path you choose, know that we’re here to support you in implementing your preferred product strategy going forward.

That’s why it’s incredibly important for small retailers like you to plan and execute marketing campaigns that your customers will not only notice, but take advantage of and appreciate.
The best marketing plans start with good data. While you probably have a system in place to collect and store customer data and transaction data to some extent, you may not be putting all those numbers and information to good use. Unfortunately, knowing how to leverage your data to come up with ideas that will resonate with your customers isn’t easy.
As long as you have strong customer and transaction data, you can gain valuable insights into your business that will help you better understand trends in your sales as well as who’s buying what, how much they’re spending and when they’re spending it. Armed with this information you’ll be able to make the best decisions for your business this holiday season, and year round.
Make Your Data Matter

1. Use it to guide your buying and merchandising choices
Buying the right product in the right amounts is the key to retail success. By reviewing sales by product category and brand you can adjust your inventory based on average monthly sales of each product. Take the time now to review your Nov/Dec 2015 sales by product so you can confirm you have enough stock on hand of last year’s bestsellers. Also, consider creating merchandising displays of these items, placing them in front of your store and promoting them as “Holiday Favorites.” You can also promote these products in your social media marketing to spur sales.
2. Use it to Improve customer relationships
Having loyal customers is critical to your growth. By examining your individual customer data, you can personalize your holiday promotions. For example, you can identify your most loyal customers over the past year and create a special holiday shopping event just for them as a thank you – stay open late, offer refreshments, music and a small discount as an incentive. As an alternative, create and mail out a one-time customer appreciation coupon that they can use anytime during the holiday season.
3. Use it to build more meaningful promotions
Consumers today are looking for brands that pay attention to their buying habits and use that knowledge to deliver promotions that will be relevant to them. Instead of having a generic “Holiday Sale,” a better approach is to identify groups of customers who continually purchase a specific brand or product from you to create a targeted campaign that promotes an exclusive offer only for that specific product/brand. Over the course of the holidays, you can create multiple targeted campaigns to generate traffic and sales throughout the season, rather than just during the “sale.” Since 40% of consumers say they would rather buy from retailers who personalize their experience1, the ROI of these types of campaigns is significant.
The Right Technology Makes all the Difference
The holidays are a good time to review how you are using your data and determine whether you need to start the new year with a plan that will enable you to build your brand and grow your business. Thankfully, there are many products available that can be seamlessly integrated into your POS system that can not only collect data for you, but deliver it to you in a way that’s easy to understand so you can better utilize it to make immediate, actionable plans and long-term business decisions.

They are cheaper than full-time employees and offer businesses more flexibility. These benefits are part of why we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of part-time jobs in the United States: according to the recent U.S. Labor Department employment report numbers, nearly 20 percent of the workforce in the United States are now part-time workers.
But increasing numbers of part-time employees also present unique challenges: Part-time workers tend to be less committed than full-timers, there is higher turnover, and often workers are less skilled. Here are a few ideas for overcoming these drawbacks, getting the most out of your staff, and helping them get the most out of their time with you:
1. Set sales goals.
Many people have an innate desire to do a good job, and the best employees are always striving to do better. Help employees achieve success by defining what a good job looks like specifically in their role. Try setting sales or revenue goals. This gives workers something to strive for, and helps them relate their daily work to overarching business goals. Clearly stated goals also establish a baseline for coaching and performance discussions later on.
2. Share accountability.
It can be difficult for part-time employees to feel like they are part of the business. Encourage staff to think like owners by asking them to take charge of specific business challenges. Make sure the challenge targets a problem you’ve noticed. Assign someone to come up with ideas to reduce waste, another to lower costs, someone to market via social media, and someone to take on filling appointments. Make sure to empower employees with tools. Making people accountable for outcomes, not just tasks, makes them accountable for real business results.
3. Make it a game.
There’s no reason work has to feel like work. As soon as employees have goals, incentivize them with friendly contests. For example, with Perka you can start a contest to see which employee signs up the most customers for a loyalty program.
4. Train staff regularly.
Every month, identify processes and tasks that could use improvement, and come up with creative ways to train staff. Salons can offer employee makeover night to train new services and experiment with new looks. If you’re a bar or restaurant offering a new special, have a contest to see who can make it the fastest without help.
Try reversing roles during a role play so staff have the opportunity to experience the business from a different perspective. For example, let a beleaguered bartender re-enact the worst customer experience ever. It will let them vent and help the team brainstorm how to improve the customer service experience going forward. Switching up roles will also give them insights into how to improve things, and will encourage them to teach each other tricks for faster or better service.
5. Ask, don’t tell.
There are few faster ways to engage employees than to ask their opinions. Share business concerns with staff—like how to increase ticket sales, encourage newsletter signups, or get new customers, and let them know you’ll be asking for ideas in your next staff meeting so they have time to think about it.
Also, make sure to ask employees in one-on-one meetings whether they have hidden talents they’d like to try out in the business. You may have a social media influencer on staff, or a brilliant marketer. Discover what they are most passionate about and encourage them to use their favorite skills at work.
6. Promote from within.
Employees who can envision their future at a business tend to perform better than workers who feel their job is temporary or a dead end. Reward high-performing employees by promoting them. Celebrate their performance and loyalty to help inspire other employees to higher performance.
Likewise, reward superb customer service ratings. Don’t just honor individuals. Often good customer experiences are a team effort. Promoting high-performers and delegating some of your work to them helps free you up for more important tasks.
7. Honor flexibility.
People often choose to work part time to help balance work-life conflicts. Honor these concerns by trying to adapt as much as possible to their schedule or by coming up with flexible work arrangements. Let them trade shifts if they need to. Clover’s app Time Clock makes employee scheduling, swapping shifts, managing time off requests, and notifying employees of changes simple.

It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Along with holiday greetings and happy meetings come more shoppers and plenty of chances for small businesses to make lasting impressions. After all, 112 million shoppers hit the stores on Small Business Saturday. A Clover POS system and apps in the Clover App Marketplace can help SMB owners retain those customers and increase sales.
Here, three apps that will help grow your customer base—not just when the weather outside is frightful, but all year around.
HostBuddy
Even the most fervent shoppers need to take a break and refuel. But who wants to stand around waiting for a table when they could be swooping up BOGO deals at the shop around the corner? HostBuddy allows diners to seamlessly add their names to an eatery’s waitlist via a Facebook Messenger bot and alerts them via the social media network or SMS text when there’s an available seat. (There’s no need to download a third-party mobile app!) Guests can also use HostBuddy to pay their bill without waiting for the check.
The CRM (customer relationship management) tool, which can also be used by salons, makeup chairs, and more, also solicits feedback. Customers can provide ratings using an easy-to-understand scale. HostBuddy gathers all the data and creates analytics to help reduce overhead costs and increase revenue.
FiveStars
Want to reward loyal customers with discounts and free items without the hassle? Skip those annoying punch cards (which are always misplaced or forgotten at home) and expensive marketing campaigns by using the automated FiveStars app, which effortlessly integrates with your Clover POS system.
To sign up, customers only have to provide a phone number. In return, they’ll receive personalized messages and unique rewards via text, email, or push notifications. Through this targeted outreach, merchants can expect to receive up to 70 percent more traffic. Even better? Customers who use the app will spend an average of 15 percent more than those who don’t participate.
GiftFly
Each year, gift cards continue to grow in popularity. Offering them can be extremely savvy for SMB owners: 72 percent of customers spend more than the value of their card, on average making a purchase that’s 20 percent higher than the amount on the card. Yet less than 3 percent of small businesses sell gift cards online. Take advantage of this lucrative market by using GiftFly. With just one click, you can add the free eGift card platform to your Clover terminal.
GiftFly allows merchants to sell digital cards in-store and on their website 24 hours a day. Consumers can send and receive the cards via email, text, and even Facebook—saving stores the costly expense of physical plastic cards. Retailers can also use GiftFly to create seasonal, customized, or branded gift cards at no extra cost.

Why do some people find it so draining to always be “on”? What makes the nitty-gritty details of running a small business such a dreaded chore for many?
It all comes down to personality. Personality defines how people experience the world, approach work, and deal with others. While humans are complex, getting a handle on personal strengths and weaknesses can be a powerful tool for managing the business and employees.
The Hay Group created its powerful Inventory of Leadership Styles to better describe the archetypal traits and behaviors found in managers. In most cases, people are composites of all of the archetypes, but with varying proportional breakdowns. Emphasizing different parts of your personality profile to better suit specific situations is a crucial skill for efficient and productive management.
Coercive: gaining immediate compliance from employees
Leaders of this type tend to be firm and strong, sending a clear message of expectation and deliverables. They can, however, get mired in micromanagement of basic tasks, stifling innovation from the ranks.
Authoritative: providing long-term vision and leadership
Managers within this category can be inspiring, reaching all ranks of staff by showing how each fits into the larger goals of the company. Negative tendencies include a disconnect from daily responsibility or oversight in favor of the big picture.
Affiliative: creating trust and harmony
Affiliative managers tend to be more sensitive, which can be a major asset when recruiting new talent, or constructing teams or task forces. Sometimes, however, they can be manipulated or distracted by employees focusing on the emotional experience rather than the work responsibility.
Democratic: reaching group consensus and generating new ideas
Team-building is key for democratic managers. They tend to get buy-in from all ranks of staff by giving each of them a voice. Their downfall can be in a failure to meet goals set by upper management or a board in favor of meeting goals set by the team itself.
Pacesetting: leading by example and accomplishing tasks to high standards
Leading by example is always a great motivation for a team, and it’s always pleasant to work for someone who understands your commitment to the job. Potential pitfalls are being disconnected from workers, however, by being focused on your individual goals and deliverables.
Coaching: focusing on the professional growth of employees
Coaching managers have a great eye for talent, and are excellent at placing new staff, or helping workers rise through the ranks. It’s possible for them, however, to focus their efforts on a small subsection of their team, rather than managing their workforce as a whole.
Inside every manager is a multitude of personalities and managerial styles. Ideally, effective managers would take the strengths of each of these profiles while discarding the weaknesses, but like everything else, that work is a process.
For small business owners, the demands of the job require impossible clusters of traits: conscientious, caring, creative, gregarious, meticulous, a strategic thinker. But no one can be all things to all people.
Instead, by recognizing how personality impacts thoughts and behavior, small business owners can highlight strengths, fix problem spots, and get a handle on how to manage people in productive, authentic ways. Personality insights can also help owners understand and train employees.
Still better, small business owners can pinpoint those parts of the business they dislike or aren’t suited for. Hiring the right people can offset some weaknesses, while Clover apps can simplify unwelcome tasks—letting people focus on what they’re hardwired to enjoy.

Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
Business, by its very nature, is a cyclical beast, at times roaring to life with lines down the block, and at others hibernating for what can seem like a long, long winter.
It’s merely fact of life, but increasingly many savvy business owners are embracing the power of smart points-of-sale and the business analysis data they provide to turn slow times of day, like the post-AM rush at coffee shops, or slow times of year, like the post-holiday retail doldrums, to make the most of what have traditionally been simply referred to as a cost of doing business.
The great thing about all of the smart business intel that today’s point-of-sale terminals can provide is that they can offer pinpoint accuracy in detailing exactly when you’re busier and slower at different times of year.
But having the data is just the first part of the story. The real action lies in using that data to uncover the underlying reasons why those cycles might exist.
Knowing “when” is the first step to turning slow times around, but it’s not the the only piece to the puzzle. Knowing “who” is just as important.
There’s simply no bringing in new customers if you don’t know who the old ones are. It’s important to do some digging to find out exactly what it is about your brand customers find valuable. Ask yourself—or even better some of them—which new products would they be into and which would be a stretch?
It’s also important that you also do a little honest soul searching about your business: classic roadside diners are unlikely big-spend date spots, and neighborhood watering holes are an unlikely place for your city’s next hot disco dancefloor, so playing into what you do best while looking for nearby-but-untapped lanes is key.
With the ‘when’ and the ‘who’ firmly within your grasp, the next step is the ‘what’ you should do to move forward. Below, we’ve outlined several ideas to make the most out of slow periods at your small business:
Boost foot traffic with a surprise sale or timely mobile special.
Email can be good among certain segments, but for best results in promoting immediate action, push notifications are really the way to go. Sending a great special during slow times to the pockets of hundreds of your customers can help keep the grill hot and the drinks flowing during the long stretch post-rush.
Diversify your product mix.
Just because you’re a coffee shop doesn’t mean you have to stick to coffee. Get a panini press and some gourmet breads, meats, and cheeses to be the next hot lunch spot on your block. Or work to bring wine and beer into your shop and serve small plates to make the bistro transformation complete. It’s all about extending your brand in ways that your customers will appreciate.
Partner up with a like-minded business.
Scan your neighborhood and city for a business whose slow times align well with yours and consider co-location or cross-selling. These types of arrangements see business leverage differences in customer profiles and habits to maximize outcomes for two or more separate businesses.
Use downtime wisely.
Sometimes there are forces at work that are simply beyond your control—perhaps your location and traffic patterns make getting to your space tough for customers at certain times of day.
Don’t dawdle during your down time—spring into action by working smarter. There are a number of time-saving apps available with today’s smart point-of-sale systems that can make the work of one person seem like three. Find some that work for you and make the most of the time you do have.

Specifically, just how are you planning to take the lessons of 2016 and use them to create an even better 2017?
Sipping that first cup of coffee of the year, it’s hard to know where to start.
Do you think blue sky: translating big dreams into bigger plans, disrupting the market, overhauling your business, and rolling out an entirely new and exciting revenue stream to make your business (and you, as its proprietor) that talk of the town?
Or do you take the pragmatic approach, pouring over your books, sales data, website analytics, and loyalty program redemptions to find the hidden opportunities that have been lurking just beneath the surface of your daily operations–those you’ve just been too busy to take the time to ferret out and exploit to your benefit?
And then there’s the middle way–taking a dash of blue sky thinking coupled with a heavy dose of pragmatism to set achievable, smart goals to improve your business incrementally, moving forward week after week, growing day by day, until you’ve achieved what it is you set out to do.
When you set the right goals, make the right investments in terms of time and effort into your business, and target those quick wins, over time your business can end up making significant gains year after year.
Below, we’ve outlined a few simple goal-setting strategies that can help you map out a successful 2017:
Focus on real problems holding your business back.
Think about the nitty-gritty details that niggle your business day in and out. Maybe it’s some unnecessary costs that are killing your bottom line. Or perhaps it’s some some time-consuming task that just kills productivity. Or perhaps you’ve got a particular product category that could be improved. Whatever it is, find one or two or three, study them from all angles, and know the internal and external forces that keep you from making the most of each area.
Set SMART goals.
Everyone thinks they set smart goals when they’re planning for the future, but to set a truly SMART goal, it’s got to be:

Specific–define the problem, all the parameters, the important stakeholders, and the key factors.


Measurable–set specific metrics by which you’re going to measure success. Whether it’s time saved, money made, additional customers through the door–it doesn’t matter–it just has to be quantifiable so success or failure can be tied to specific numbers.


Achievable–it’s just as important to set goals that are actually within the realm of possibility. Sure, sometimes it’s nice to shoot for the moon, but if you’re really looking to make real improvements to your business, setting small goals and then achieving them is better than trying to hit home runs all day and falling short.


Relevant–key to setting a good goal for your business is ensuring that you’re focusing on the right things. For example, if you’re looking to reduce line times at your ice cream shop, hiring a new delivery driver might not be a helpful measure. Focus on the problem at hand, and then set goals that directly apply to it.


Time-bound–imperative to setting and achieving a good goal is putting an expiration date on it. That is, setting a period of time in which you’re going to implement your plan and take action on your goal. With a deadline looming on the horizon, and a set of key measurable metrics you’re working towards, you’ll be much more likely to achieve what it is you’re after.

Employ tools where it makes sense.
Many of those who start their own businesses have that old-school pioneer spirit where they feel as if they have to take on the world with nothing but true grit and elbow grease. bBut if you think you have to suffer to have a successful business, think again.
Today, savvy proprietors work smarter, not harder, and key to achieving your small business goals in 2017 is employing the right tools. Whether you need a hand managing time cards, running a loyalty marketing program, optimizing your menu, ordering everyday supplies, or any other of the million-and-a-half tasks a small business owner has to tackle each day, there are a number of apps  to help you manage the day-to-day so you can focus on thriving rather than just surviving.

news_111,news,Business problem turnaround: A smart wifi strategy for your business,"All types of businesses can benefit from providing free wi-fi for their customers. Here are distinct ways to use wi-fi to improve your business's service, boost loyalty efforts and grow your customer base.…",04-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/problems-possibilities-smart-wifi-strategy-business/,"This post is part of our Business Problem Turnaround series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
Not long ago, free Wi-Fi was considered a risky proposition, with technical problems and loitering customers heading the list of concerns. But today, the potential disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages.
According to a 2014 survey, foot traffic, time on premises, and amount spent by customers were higher in establishments that provide free Wi-Fi. From retail to quick service restaurants to car repair shops, many consumer-facing small businesses are capitalizing on these benefits, while others are preparing to jump on board.
To get going, here are some ideas on how to seize opportunities for all kinds of businesses.
Build clientele for quick service restaurants.
Peek inside many quick service restaurants, and you’ll probably see the usual diners who want a fast bite to eat. But another kind of customer has become increasingly common: mobile workers with laptops.
Today, 55 million Americans are independent workers, according to a 2016 study commissioned by the nonprofit Freelancers Union. This roving labor force is looking for spaces to connect, collaborate, create—or just get a change of scenery.
Restaurant owners who attract them with tables, outlets, and reliable and secure Wi-Fi report bottom-line benefits. Customers stay longer, buy more, and bring others through the doors.
On the flip side, a flow of chatty diners can clash with tables of quiet workers focused on their screens. To accommodate their different needs, restaurant owners might designate specific areas as Quiet Zones or Talking Zones.
Transform sleepy coffee shops into bustling Internet cafes.
When Starbucks ushered in unlimited free Wi-Fi to its 11,000 outlets, independent coffee shops had little choice but to follow. Many transitioned from laid-back spots for grabbing a cup of coffee into alternative workspaces for students and independent workers.
While the extra traffic and business is great, some people never want to leave. “Laptop squatters” can be especially problematic in high-rent urban areas. Many coffee shops and other businesses are experimenting with creative solutions—such as revolving access codes tied to purchasing requirements, laptop rates, reserved seating, and more—to free up tables and boost overall sales.
Repurpose restaurants into co-working offices during off-peak hours.
Even some full-service restaurants are tapping into the alternative workplace trend. Rather than letting their restaurants languish before the dinner crowds arrive, some owners are renting out workspace to the laptop crowd. Wi-Fi service makes the transformation easy.
Facilitate business meetings with enterprise-level Wi-Fi.
Whether face-to-face or via video chat, having a client meeting space is vital to independent lawyers, programmers, writers, and others without traditional offices. For business owners, that means providing strong Internet service and adequate electrical outlets.
While many small businesses offer consumer-grade Wi-Fi similar to what people have at home, enterprise-level service can be the better bet for handling a wealth of devices that need higher bandwidth, speed, and reliability. Consider making a small investment in enterprise-level Wi-Fi, and reassess how many outlets the location needs to keep laptops charged.
Encourage customers to make decisions using online reviews.
When it’s time to choose between brands or justify a higher price tag, online reviews can seal the sale. With storewide Wi-Fi, customers are more likely to linger longer, make sounder decisions, and stay satisfied with their purchases.
And how many marketing efforts can top customers tweeting about the store, sending “checking in” notices to Facebook, or posting product pictures to Instagram?
Make Wi-Fi part of the branding and loyalty efforts.
Free Wi-Fi offers unique opportunities to get the word out. Using a custom Wi-Fi network name, such as “Tip-Top Laundry Free Wi-Fi,” helps publicize the brand and brings customers in. Many people filter businesses based on free Wi-Fi, and head to the ones with the services they need. A Wi-Fi guest portal also provides a way to advertise offers when customers log into the network.

With laptop-wielding freelancers growing in numbers and smartphones everywhere, few businesses can afford to limit online access when customers enter their doors. With a little thought and some technical assistance from the digital natives among the staff, anyone can implement a smart Wi-Fi plan that enhances customer numbers, loyalty, sales, branding, and more.

news_112,news,5 questions to ask before hiring a manager,"Hiring a manager for your small business is a big step and expense, but it can also take some day-to-day tasks off your plate and free up time. Here are five questions to ask yourself before doing so.…",05-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-hire-manager/,"This post is part of our “5 questions” series, helping merchants ask the right questions before making key business decisions. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
Being an entrepreneur is more than a full-time job. It’s a passion. And it can easily take over your life. The idea of hiring someone to take some of the day-to-day tasks off your plate may be appealing.
But hiring a manager for your small business is a big step. It’s a new expense, of course, but it also means trusting someone else to be at the front lines of your business. Before you make such a crucial hire, it’s worth stepping back and asking yourself if this is really the right move at the right time.
Here are five questions to ask before you hire a manager:
1. Do we have multiple locations?
If you’ve got several locations, or if you’re thinking of expanding, hiring a manager makes a lot of sense. You can only be in one place at a time, after all. Employees need a consistent leadership presence to guide them, and someone to turn to when they run into problems. You don’t want staff texting you whenever they have a question! Customers also want someone they can talk to if things go wrong. Having an on-site manager gives everyone the reassurance that someone (in the building) is in charge.
2. Am I a good manager?
This business may be your baby, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re the best person to train and manage employees. Maybe you’re more of a big-picture kind of person. Maybe you’re a creative designer, a great planner, or you have a strong intuitive sense of what customers are looking for, but managing people just isn’t one of your strengths. It’s OK! Not everyone can be a great boss. If you aren’t, you can still hire someone who is.
3. Am I a part-time entrepreneur?
If this business is still your side hustle, it’s worth thinking through when you actually want to go full-time. Do you want to dive right into day-to-day management, or would you rather hire someone to handle the details of keeping the business running and hold onto that outside income stream for a while?
4. Am I needed elsewhere?
As a founder, you may need to spend a lot of your time meeting with potential distributors, vendors, or partners. You’re the visionary here; your time is the most valuable asset you have. Your time may be better spent making those crucial connections than managing employees or even connecting with customers. A manager could help free you up to spend your time more strategically.
5. How does a manager fit into my strategic plan?
A lot of business owners just wait until they can afford more staff—then as soon as they can pay a manager, they hire one. But ideally, a manager should help you grow your income, taking day-to-day responsibilities off your to-do list so that you can focus on the high-priority items that will help you grow. Of course, you can’t hire staff if you can’t pay them. But hiring a manager should be a strategic, as well as financial, decision. Just having the cash in the bank isn’t enough of a reason to hire, and the fact that a new hire would be a financial stretch isn’t necessarily enough of a reason to wait.

The key to making a big new hire work out for your business is always going to be finding the right person. But before you start the work of searching for a new manager, it makes sense to stop and ask yourself how this person fits into your overall plans for your business and for your work-life balance.

He’s found a way to balance the creative work of a stylist with the responsibility of a business owner, maintaining a complex system of booking, payments, and retail.

A defining characteristic of successful small business owners is the ability to fulfill a number of different functions within the staff. Early on in a business plan, and often throughout the life of a business, an owner or co-owner assumes responsibilities in management and planning in addition to the craft or service their business is built around.
Tony Westenhaver is no exception. As the owner of Tonto Hair Salon in Denver, Colorado, his primary role is that of stylist, and he keeps a busy client load.
“The thing about being a small business owner is that not only do i work behind the chair 50 hours a week just doing my personal business,” Tony says, “but I have the shop business to take care of as well.”
Tony isn’t the only multi-faceted worker at the salon. Pierce covers reception in addition to doing hair. As a frequent user of the register and Clover point-of-sale system, he says, “It’s been an ongoing process of keeping everything fresh. We like to change things up a lot here.”
With a team that busy, it’s crucial to utilize systems to maximize efficiency. “We thought that a new point-of-sale would help alleviate a bit of the time taken per transaction,” says Pierce. “We were looking to cut costs as well as since we were bringing in new products all the time, and Clover allows us to do that.”
It’s not just the speed and ease of transactions, however, that make Clover a time-saving device for Tonto. Tony relies on the bookkeeping aspects of an electronic point-of-sale to track his business metrics as well.
He shares, “You know, what I liked best about [Clover] is that at the end of the week, it’s the reporting processes on the machine that makes life easy for me. I can look at daily totals… weekly totals… and tax reports. It just makes all of those things much easier for me.”
Pierce is pleased at how the device manages inventory, saving countless hours of tedious work and allowing for more creative time. “Even when you are entering in products that you’ve just received, it’s simple. Time is pretty tight here anyway. We keep simplifying, and that helps keep things running smoothly.”
For Tony, these time-saving steps allow him to be a stylist first. “There’s no question, it makes my life a lot easier. For me to spend the time I spend behind the chair, anything I can do to cut time elsewhere creates a lot less stress for me and helps to balance my life a little bit.”

news_114,news,Be It Resolved: Starting a New Business,Thinking about starting a new business? Make sure you answer critical questions in these three potential blind spots first.…,10-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/resolved-starting-new-business/,"With the new year comes resolutions galore—eat better, workout more, maybe work less. Whether personally or professionally, the list goes on and on. But what about entrepreneurs out there looking to start a business in 2017? What kind of insight do you need to help get your vision off the ground and make 2017 a year to remember? Your friends at Clover understand that starting a business is never easy. And, although it may seem daunting, we can help you on your path to making your dream come true.
For starters, know there are three categories of questions you must examine in your due diligence. We break it down into personal assessments, business planning and logistics, and legal matters. Let’s take a look at what each entails.
Personal Assessments
Striking out on your own is an incredibly exciting proposition. But it definitely isn’t for the faint of heart. Ask yourself these questions to gauge your readiness for the tasks at hand.
1. Are you a self starter? Motivated? Resilient? When you’re your own boss, everything that needs to get done rests on your shoulders. Make sure you’re confident in your ability to accept and act on that range of responsibility.
2. What’s your financial situation? Do you have enough money to pay your personal bills as you get your business off the ground? Starting your own business often requires deep and prolonged financial sacrifices. Knowing that the owner is often the last to get paid, it’s important to be ready for these realities before you get started.
3. What’s your appetite for work? Entrepreneurship requires long hours, often twice that of a typical 40-hour work week. It’s important you steel yourself for the physical and emotional rigors of pursuing your dream.
Business Planning and Logistics
Now that you’ve established your personal readiness, let’s take a quick look at some the questions about the business itself.
1. Are you meeting a clear business need? This probably goes without saying, but unless your product or service answers this question in the affirmative, your chances of success are very limited. Do your research to ensure what you offer will be sought after by your target audience.
2. Speaking of, have you clearly defined your competition and do you know your customer? These questions are discussed a little more in depth here, but you need to understand who you’re competing against (both locally and nationally). You also need to develop a very specific picture of who you’re targeting. It can go a long way in helping devise an effective marketing plan.
3. What are your operating costs and budget? This ties in closely with #2 above. Financial concerns are often the most worrisome aspect of starting a new business. By taking time to figure out how much your product costs to produce as well as what kind of operating capital you need for every day expenses, you’ll ease your fears and put yourself on solid ground.
Legal Matters
This is the least fun stuff to talk about, but the most important to do. Without solid legal footing, your business won’t be able to function.
1. What’s in a name? Is it unique? Does it need to be registered? And what kind of corporation does that name represent? You can find more answers to help you here.
2. How taxing is it going to be? Bear in mind that the government always gets its cut. Knowing your obligations up front helps make this as painless as possible.
3. Do you have your permits, licenses, and insurance? Being successful as an entrepreneur often involves dotting i’s and crossing t’s. But again, without these items, it would be legally impossible for you to operate your emerging enterprise.

There are a lot of comprehensive lists that tell you what you need to do to get up and running, but we hope this one gives you a quick snapshot of all the relevant things you need to consider. It’s a new year, and the possibilities are endless. Be confident in your endeavor and, as always, let Clover know if we can answer any questions. We’re rooting for your success!

Here are 5 topics you should be reporting on in order to make the right decisions about where to take your business next.…",11-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/like-big-guys-performance-reporting/,"Learn more about the processes, initiatives and habits of enterprise businesses, and how you can adapt those processes to help your small or medium business run better.
Performance reports are a critical aspect of running a business. They can indicate how strong sales are at any given moment, whether a business is running ahead of last year, and even track things like inventory, best-selling products, and which employees sell the most. The ability to track key performance measures is now a competitive advantage. McKinsey Global estimates that using data and information in your product launches and business decisions can improve your profit margin by 60 percent.
Here are 5 simple ways to use data to gain insight into your business.
Identify strong products or services.
Take a look at what products are selling well and consider why. Are there new markets for these products? Are there complementary products you can cross-sell when promoting them? If your business involves service, find promotions to entice them to increase the frequency of visits.
Identify weak products or services.
Take a close look at your weakest selling products and services and your return on every sale they make. Are they worth carrying? Would they work better with adjustments? If it’s a new product, was it advertised enough?

Discover new customers.
Take a look at popular businesses near you—can you attract new customers by taking advantage of your location? Clover’s free Insights app lets you look at businesses in the neighborhood to see their most popular days and times. This can be a great way to identify whether your store hours need to be adjusted. If a local business is bringing in a ton of commuters early in the mornings or at the end of the business day, perhaps catering to those hours will improve business for you as well. Is there a popular local bridal boutique? Perhaps your business can supply Bachelorette or Bridal party specials. Is there a daycare facility next door? Consider offering child-friendly items or an area where children can play while customers shop. Check out this blog series by Clover to learn more about using Insights to improve sales.
Uncover seasonal fluctuations.
A close look at sales by month will likely show fluctuations and seasonal patterns. Forecasting seasonal dips can help businesses determine how many staff members to have on hand and whether it pays to keep a business open during particular times of year.
Determine best locations.
Examine the net revenue of each location to determine which location is performing the best. Then dig deeper into the data to discover why. Are most of the sales during a particular time of day? Is a product flying off the shelves at one location, but not another? Or is a particular employee selling more than her peers? Analyzing the data can help you determine whether to close a location or whether to experiment with adjusting product placement or other variables. Even better, some analytics will let you research a location before opening a branch to see whether it’s likely to be profitable.

Information is power—make more informed decisions by taking advantage of performance reports. For more ideas on how to leverage data to improve business decisions read: Let Data Drive Your Sales This Season.

news_116,news,Be It Resolved: Getting paid,"As different payment methods proliferate, getting paid as a small business owner is more complicated than it sounds. Here are 5 areas to look at if you’re considering a payment policy overhaul for the new year.…",12-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/resolved-getting-paid/,"It’s a simple idea—at first glance, too simple to count as a business goal for the new year. But as different payment methods proliferate, getting paid as a small business owner is more complicated than it sounds. And making payments a priority in the new year could pay off big time for your small business. Here are 5 areas to look at if you’re considering a payment policy overhaul for the new year:
1. Mobile payments.
Most consumers aren’t using mobile payments…yet. But those who do use them are very attractive customers. Almost a quarter of millennials make a mobile payment at least once a week, and high-income consumers are even more likely to use mobile. Meanwhile, more than half of all consumers are aware of the mobile payments trend. With young, wealthy consumers leading the way, adoption of mobile payments is likely to continue to grow. If you’re not already accepting mobile payments, make 2017 the year you add this increasingly popular option.
2. Gift cards.
Like mobile payments, gift cards are really popular among young consumers. They’re convenient for customers—an easy gift to buy and one that most people love to get. They’re also great for your business. They can bring new customers through the door, and they encourage people to spend more once they’re in the store. If you’re using a modern POS system, they’re also easy for your staff to ring up, and they automatically generate a lot of useful customer data. If you don’t currently offer gift cards, now’s the time to start.
3. Chip card technology.
If you’re not able to accept chip card technology, you probably know you should be. Merchants who still can’t accept chip cards are now liable for fraudulent purchases, and businesses that were slow to adopt the new tech have already felt the pinch. If that’s not enough reason for you to update your tech, think of your customers—as chip-card technology becomes more and more widespread, consumers are more and more aware of the additional security it offers. If you haven’t already, now is the time to protect your business and please your customers by offering chip card processing.
4. Back-end processing times.
It’s good for business to make it easy for your customers to pay you, and it’s great for business to make sure that money gets into your account as quickly as possible. Seemingly small mistakes, like using a different bank for payment processing than the bank where you have your deposit account, can delay getting funds to you, and those delays can add up. Take some time early this year to review your payment processing systems and make sure they’re state-of-the-art and optimized for speed.
5. Loans.
Even when business is great, credit can be crucial to keep things running smoothly. And when you do need credit, you want it quick. Better to investigate your options now, so you know where to turn when you need funds. There are a lot of options today that can get cash into your account in as little as 24 hours, but in some cases you’ll pay extra for speed. Take some time early this year to compare marketplace lenders, peer-to-peer lending, the Clover cash advance system, and other funding options, so the next time you need extra cash, you know you’re getting the best and most convenient deal possible.

Payment processing may seem dull in comparison to designing a new storefront display or starting a new social media marketing plan. But a well-run payments system can actually help attract new customers. And when your business is running smoothly, you, and your staff, can spend more of your time keeping your customers happy.

news_117,news,Why businesses should consider adopting mobile payments,"Mobile payment technology isn’t quite mainstream yet, but there are reasons businesses should consider incorporating the option into their payment mix.…",16-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/why-businesses-should-consider-adopting-mobile-payments/,"Mobile payment technology isn’t quite mainstream yet, but there are reasons businesses should consider incorporating the option into their payment mix.
Businesses, particularly small businesses, have been slow to adopt mobile payment technologies like Apple Pay. Apple doesn’t charge any additional fees to merchants for Apple Pay, but there are some disincentives that may be holding business owners back, like the perceived hassle of training staff on a new system, or the need for some merchants to upgrade older point-of-sale terminals.
The incentives to change may be harder for business owners to see. But a closer look will show plenty of reasons to add mobile payments to the options you offer customers.
Adopting mobile payments is a down payment on the future
First of all, consumers expect mobile payments to become more common in the future. According to a recent survey by Accenture, consumers expect a 60% increase in mobile wallet adoption by 2020. Right now, cash and cards are still by far the most common ways to pay, but the use of cash fell 7% from 2015 to 2016, while consumer awareness of mobile payment options grew.
Mobile payments customers are an attractive target market
Right now, only about 1 in 5 consumers makes mobile payments on a regular basis, according to Accenture. But the early-adopter consumers who do use mobile payment options are attractive customers. Consumers who have made mobile payments are more likely to be millennials or Gen-Xers; they’re more likely to be highly educated; and they’re more likely to have bank accounts, according to research by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
These early adopters like using their phones or watches to make payments for a number of reasons, according to Pew Research. Young consumers like getting electronic receipts emailed to them, getting rewards, and the convenience of mobile payments that can be easily linked to budgeting apps to help them avoid overdrawing their accounts. Young consumers have their smartphones with them all the time. It’s increasingly natural for them to want to do everything—order lunch, shop for clothing, hunt for a new apartment, pay a friend back for drinks last night—on their devices. Mobile payments are just part of this larger trend.
Businesses might want to avoid being seen as standing in the way of new tech
Given all these benefits for consumers, it seems likely that more people would be using mobile payments if more businesses offered the option. Consumers are expecting to use mobile payment methods more in the future–will merchants hold them back?
If your small business uses modern point-of-sale terminals like the Clover system, you already have the capacity to accept Apple Pay. Most already have the capacity to accept contactless payments, and the back-end processing software to make adoption of mobile payments virtually seamless. And if you’re a Clover partner, we’ve got staff ready to advise you on how to train your staff through the transition.
Why not position your business as an early adopter of mobile payment technology? It’s a way to offer added convenience to some of your most desirable customers, and demonstrate that your business is ahead of the curve. And if you’re with Clover, adoption will be easier than you think.

1. Get the Word Out
There are many ways to get the word out about your business—social media, email, even a good old-fashioned sidewalk hawker. One often overlooked method is to reach out to reviewers, local listing services, bloggers, and other community resources. Getting mentioned or reviewed in these arenas can really help spread the word locally about your business. If you’re a restaurant or eatery, ask customers to review you on Yelp, Google Business, and other review sites. If you’re a local store, consider whether there’s a news angle that might interest local reporters. For example, letting local artists exhibit on the walls, a night when local bands can play, or you only use locally-sourced products. Contact the local Chamber of Commerce, Town Hall, and library to see if there are places you can advertise or post flyers for free.
2. Solve a Problem
If you’re in a business district it’s a no-brainer to advertise catering services for meetings, discounts for employees, or small “Thank You” gifts for employees who did a good job. Business districts also have a natural flow of traffic, before and after work, and during lunch. Brainstorm ways to capitalize on this traffic by offering pre-commute specials starting at 4:30, lunch specials, or ways to pre-order and pre-pay so they don’t have to stand in line. Solving problems for customers, like how to squeeze in lunch or get home faster, inspires customer loyalty and regular business.
3. Reach the Hard-to-Reach
Sometimes expanding your customer base is as simple as offering delivery services. Market delivery options to assisted-living and senior centers, or target working parents by leaving marketing materials in local daycare centers. These customers are likely to appreciate the convenience of delivery and are often willing to pay a premium for it. Tourists and other travelers are another market for delivery services. Hotels and resorts typically offer information on local businesses as a service to their guests. Ask hotel managers whether they would include your menu of services, either in the rooms or at the front desk. You can use Zuppler Online Ordering to accomplish these tasks and more with direct integration into your Clover system.
4. Start an Email List.
You don’t have to offer discounts and coupons to establish an email list. Consider instead offering compelling content that people will gladly exchange their email for. Every business has unique knowledge they can share. Dry cleaning services can, for example, offer tips on caring for delicate fabrics. Retail stores can offer tips on choosing products, style guides on choosing clothes to flatter your shape, or ideas for choosing the perfect gift.
Once you have an email list, use automated email marketing services, like Mail Chimp or Constant Contact, to send out birthday promotions and other personalized messages. Marketing works best when the messages are personalized and relevant to the customer. By integrating purchases and customer information with your automated marketing system, you can send targeted special promotions like inviting your biggest spenders to exclusive sales. Apps, such as Abreeze Link for Constant Contact or Mailchimp, connect your systems seamlessly and make personalized marketing easy.
5. Take Advantage of Free Resources
The local Chamber of Commerce, state government websites, and libraries often have free resources for small businesses. Vendors you work with, like banks and insurance companies, will likely also have free information. The Clover blog, for example, is a great source of ideas to bring your business to the next level. Even better, The Clover App Market is like having your own team of experts to make your business more successful. Whether you’re looking to implement a loyalty program, offer an online waiting list, or simplify social media promotions we have apps to get the job done.

news_119,news,Business Scenario: Key employee quits at an inopportune time,A dreaded scenario for any small business: a critical employee leaves at the worst time. This article will take a look at several tactics you can employ to help you weather an unforeseen storm.…,18-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-key-employee-quits-inopportune-time/,"Imagine this: business is booming at your New Jersey bar. Even though your team is small, everyone knows their role and responsibilities, ensuring everything works like clockwork. You’re feeling pretty much invincible on one of your biggest nights: Bruce Springsteen’s final show playing just across the street. And then, it happens—one of your best people quits, leaving you instantly shorthanded. What do you do?
Even though this is a very specific example (that really did happen), the lessons learned are applicable to a broad range of small businesses. This article will take a look at several tactics you can employ to help you weather an unforeseen storm.
1. Stay calm and utilize your resources.
This may seem obvious, but the instinct in the above scenario is usually to panic. And, while you may have the urge to be angry at the departing employee, nothing is to be gained from that. Hopefully, your management is cross-trained and can hop into any role on your team, be it kitchen work, front of house, retail inventory, and more. To keep managers in shape, rotate them into each department of work from time to time, so that if there is a crisis, they’re ready to go. Likewise, as owner or lead, you should be able to perform any role in the pipeline to prevent congestion in an emergency like this one.
2. Establish thoughtful redundancies.
It’s obviously much easier to cope with the situation if you’re not trying to mitigate the issue on the fly. You’ve trained your employees well. Make sure you have an itemized list of the responsibilities and tasks each staff member controls so that they are easily reassigned. Information or skill should never lie with one staffer alone. If one link in the chain is removed, all information should still be easily accessed. For example, records involving orders in process should be readily available to multiple eyes.
3. Write and know your contingency plan.
Establish a strong contingency plan for an under-staffed shift—not a theoretical plan, but literally a list of actions to be taken to keep business in motion in desperate circumstances. If something happens and you aren’t in the building, you can direct a staffer to find this list and take concrete steps to help until you or someone else is available for further support. Readiness is key
4. Lean on the Clover App Market.
Automation can save the day when you are short staffed, and the Clover App Market is a fantastic resource for small businesses looking to find reliable solutions for a lot of common tasks. You’ll find a suite of Homebase apps that cover staffing and schedule management, customer relationship management apps from BuyFi that can provide crucial record-keeping, Abreeze Link for effective email communication, allowing for quick announcements on changes to menus, hours, or services available, and many more.

You know better than anyone that success in small business is never by accident. Hopefully this article gives you the tools and advice you need to be ready for the unexpected among your staff. As the old saying goes, “Luck favors the prepared.” But by being properly prepared, you’ll never have to worry about luck being on your side.

Welcome to our monthly roundup of research small businesses can use to do business better.
E-commerce is king.

Whenever, wherever…the convenience of shopping online is what attracts shoppers to the world of e-commerce. During the third quarter of 2016, e-commerce sales in the United States reached $101.3 billion, an increase of 4 percent from the previous quarter. U.S. Department of Commerce
During the next five years, the categories anticipated to have the fastest online shopping growth are pets, garden supplies, art, consumer electronics, and sports equipment. Apparel, computers, and other electronics will continue to rack up the most web sales. Forrester
Small business owners recognize the importance of technology, but almost half are significantly hampered by the cost of implementing it. Clover point-of-sale hardware and software offers merchants the ability to customize and upgrade their e-commerce business affordably. Goldman Sachs
For e-commerce sales to grow even more, business owners need to improve the mobile shopping experience. Currently, conversion rates are significantly better on desktop than mobile: 26 percent of items placed in a desktop shopping cart are purchased compared to just 16 percent on mobile. Adobe Mobile
E-commerce sales are predicted to reach almost $500 billion by 2018. eMarketer

Mobile grows in popularity

Shoppers are in love with their mobile devices, using them for everything from taking photos and tracking fitness to, of course, making purchases. During the third quarter of 2016, 20 percent of all sales happened on smartphones and tablets, an increase of almost 4 percent year-over-year. comScore

Here are 8 apps that can maximize your working hours.…",24-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/resolved-find-time-2017/,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that Americans have five hours of leisure time each day. Yet, many small business owners would say that they have far less than that, spending most—if not all—of their waking hours focused on work. After all, being an entrepreneur requires you to wear countless hats. But it doesn’t have to be that way.
For small business owners, 2017 is the year of reclaiming valuable time. Clover and its app market streamlines time-consuming tasks, freeing up minutes (or even hours) of your day to focus on the more creative aspects of growth or other things you want to do.
Here are 8 apps that maximize your working hours, giving you new found time to do with as you please.
Employee management

You can’t live without your employees. But managerial duties can consume large portions of your days. Sister apps Time Clock and Schedule take the load off your shoulders, automating various tasks like schedule distribution (via email and text message), time-off requests, and timesheets. These tools also handle tricky monetary tasks such as declaring cash tips, integrating credit card tips and labor cost reporting.
 If you’re the owner of a salon or other business where customers make appointments (like a tutoring business or a personal shopping service), you know how important it is to maintain a perfect calendar. Instead of taking on the extremely time-consuming task of building an online calendar, Salon Scheduler does the work for you. View appointments for all your employees, create predetermined time frames for each service, and set worker commissions all in one spot. It’s customer-friendly as well, sending automatic text reminders in advance of appointments.
Small businesses don’t have separate human resources departments like large corporations do. Rather, it’s likely the owner or a senior member of the management team that handles important, yet seemingly never-ending tasks related to onboarding employees and benefits. Gusto Payroll Integration automatically collects forms like I-9s and W-4s, creates an employee directory, tracks vacation time and integrates it with your payroll system, and automates local, state, and federal tax payments.

Inventory management

The typical grocery store is stocked with an average of 39,500 products. Your business might stock significantly fewer items than that, but staying on top of inventory can still be overwhelming. Shopventory eases this task, tracking SKUs and providing reports of sales complete with trend analysis. Upgraded versions monitor stock at multiple locations and handle purchase orders—keeping you in the know about your growing business without devoting all your time monitoring its goods.
In the ever-changing retail and restaurant climates, nimble small businesses are able to adapt, maximizing profit in the process. To do this, owners and managers must be able to monitoring sales in real time, which can be tricky unless they have the proper data analytics. Using easy-to-comprehend charts and bar graphs, Dashboard provides metrics such as orders per hour, sales per customer, category of sales, and more. No longer do you have to wonder where your sales stand after a few hours or 10 days into the month; this app provides that detail of information at your fingers (whether you’re using a smartphone, tablet, or computer).

Financial management

Offering a daily special can be a great way to attract new customers and develop loyalty with existing ones. The downside? Changing the price on an item every day can be extremely time consuming. Price Changer automates the process, increasing or decreasing an item’s cost on command. Its level of customization is extremely high—giving business owners the ability to schedule different prices for specific time periods in the same day. The app keeps it simple: changing the price instead of calculating a discount, which could be confusing for a customer or store employee.
Cash can be complicated. A customer can pay and an error is made when making change; a manager can forget to note that they removed greenbacks from an overflowing drawer. The app Cash Log neatly tracks all these transactions in an easy-to-read table, noting which employee made the transaction and when and the reason why.

news_122,news,3 things to consider when structuring your loyalty program,"Today’s loyalty programs are designed to maximize ROI in terms of cost, time, and effort. Here are several items to consider when setting up and running your loyalty program so you can bring your most valuable customers back more frequently.…",25-01-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-things-consider-structuring-loyalty-program/,"Though you may have not always have been a planner in your personal life, it’s a fact that you have to become one once you own a small business.
Sure, at the beginning, you may have been a free-spirited artist looking to make a living off of your craft. However, the minute you decided to get serious about making money doing what you love, you began to undertake round after round of careful planning.
And when it comes to starting and implementing a loyalty plan, the same approach applies–careful planning.
Sure, you could print up some buy-nine-get-the-tenth-free punch cards–and that would certainly be a functional approach–however, you wouldn’t be making the most of today’s loyalty program technology.
With the ability to be flexible to your type of business, to assist with promoting specials, and to assist with some low-level customer relationship management, today’s loyalty programs are designed to maximize ROI in terms of cost, time, and effort, as long as you know how to structure the loyalty program in a way that’s going to benefit your business most.
Below, we’ve outlined several items to consider when setting up and running your loyalty program so you can make the most of your time while bringing back your most valuable customers more frequently.
1. Deciding punches vs. points
The first thing most people try to decide when starting a loyalty program is whether they’ll award and reward loyalty based on visits/frequency or amount spent. To choose, there’s a fairly easy rule of thumb to apply: if your store/shop is a low-ticket business, like an ice cream parlor or pizza by the slice, choose punches/frequency. If it’s more large ticket, like a clothing boutique or sports outfitter, go with points/ticket value.
2. What items should count?
Deciding what to apply credit for depends on what kind of program you have. If it’s points, this decision doesn’t matter–your program is based on ticket value. That is, unless you sell a lot of a singular high ticket item, for example, you’re the only store that sells Gucci handbags in your area and you can’t keep them on the shelf. You might want to exclude those from your loyalty program–certainly something to consider.
But when it comes to a punches/frequency program, keep it simple: choose the item you sell most and use that. It’s what brings people in, and the idea of earning more will keep people coming back.
3. What items should be offered to loyal customers?
Again, here, if you have a punch/frequency-based program, keep it simple and offer the item you sell the most. If you’d really like to treat your best customers, offer a bonus after they hit multiple multiples of however many you’re requiring for redemption–if it’s the 10th free, at 30th offer 2 free, at the 50th, pay their whole ticket (within reason). Like that.
On the other hand, if you’re a points-based program, the name of the game is value. Your best customers–those that are in a position to earn your reward–they spend a lot of money with you, and that loyalty should be rewarded. Perhaps something nice on the house from last season’s collection. Or a significant discount on their next visit. Whatever it is, don’t be cheap. These are your most valuable customers–remember to treat them accordingly.

Clover Rewards lets you create a fun, effective loyalty program within minutes. To learn more, visit the Clover App Market.

Every entrepreneur is always looking for ways to improve their bottom line. Both the handheld and countertop versions of Clover’s POS help them do just that, affordably enabling store and quick-service restaurant owners to accept various methods of payments and to stay on top of employee matters, among other business-related tasks.
Now, these three apps make it even easier for Clover users to manage stock, generate reports, and sell their wares online.
Top Up: Purchase Orders
Without technology, tracking your inventory is a labor-intensive task that can overwhelm even the best small business owner. The Top Up: Purchase Orders app by Abreeze Technology automates the process—adding and deducting as sales, returns, and restocking occurs. Enter your vendors into the app and select the items that you want to track, as well as the maximum and minimum amount of each you want to keep in stock. When a hot seller starts to run low, Top Up automatically reorders the item by creating a purchase order to send to the applicable wholesaler. (You can also create manual purchase orders using the app.) When the shipment arrives, receive it, and your inventory is updated accordingly.
Easy Reports
Today’s technology can provide entrepreneurs with valuable information on how to take their business to the next level. But organizing big data into usable reports can be tricky and time-consuming, not to mention expensive if it requires manpower or a unique computer program.
Small business owners can log into Easy Reports by Zoomify using their Clover username and password. The app organizes sales data by item, date, or sales person, for example. Once the app’s filters are set to your preferences, save them for your next visit (saving you valuable time), then compile your sales data and receive reports complete with easy-to-read tables, pie charts, and bar graphs. To incorporate the data into other reports or financial documents, the app enables you to export the information into Excel, CSV, or PDF.
Sell Online
These days, simply being a brick-and-mortar merchant doesn’t cut it. You’ve got to have a presence on the web. If you aren’t tech savvy, hiring a developer to build your online store can cost a pretty penny; do it yourself and risk angering customers if the site isn’t intuitive or if purchases go awry.
Instead, opt for Sell Online, which can be used with your Clover POS. With one click, it adds e-commerce to any website or blog—including those sites created on platforms like WordPress, Wix, and SquareSpace. Sell Online can also be added to your social media pages (Facebook, Tumblr), giving your store a marketing boost for little cost.
Sell Online is user-friendly for both merchants and shoppers. It fully syncs with your inventory, so there’s no danger of angering a shopper by selling her a product that is no longer in stock. And it’s perfect for today’s mobile shopper, since it supports purchases made on smartphones and tablets, in addition to those made on computers.

No matter what your business is, find solutions to help it run better in the Clover App Market.

news_125,news,Business problem turnaround: How one bar turned a location challenge into a new revenue driver,How one business turned a sticky location problem into a significant revenue stream.…,01-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-one-bar-turned-location-challenge-new-revenue-driver/,"This post is part of our Business Problem Turnaround series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
When sizing up a location for a new business, owners take a number of factors into consideration—that is, aside from the all-important cost per square foot.
Things like foot traffic, demographics of the neighborhood, parking and traffic patterns, the history of the site, the stylistic fit for the business, proximity to competition and complementary businesses, zoning and ordinances on the site, and utility costs often play huge roles in the process.
But what do you do when one of those seemingly positive factors turns out to be a handicap—or at least not as advantageous as you’d originally thought?
Let’s examine an actual case study of a sports bar near a major metropolitan center.
When the owner was choosing a location for his new business, and the leasing agent showed him the location in to which he’d eventually move, he thought he’d hit the jackpot for his new sports bar venture.
That’s because the location was within sight of the stadium where an NFL team played every Sunday in the fall.
In addition, it had a generous parking lot being placed on the edge of a shopping/business complex, making this location, in his mind, the perfect place for a sports bar.
Read more: Marketing & Promotions tips and tactics
But after they moved in, and a couple months pass, the bar didn’t become the packed pre-game warm-up bar that he and his colleagues had anticipated. After asking some customers, the problem became apparent:
Though the bar was somewhat close to the stadium, it wasn’t convenient for customers to walk to the stadium after they’d had a few drinks. The stadium access roads have high volume traffic and lacked sidewalks.
It’s easy to see the problem here, but the sports bar owner saw an opportunity. And thus the Sunday Shuttle Service was born.
The owner contracted with a local transportation company to drive customers to and from the stadium, bought some branded vehicle wraps as to let other football fans know the free shuttle service—and the bar itself—existed each time they dropped off a load of customers curbside at the stadium, and bought some radio spots on the local sports talk station.
By just the next weekend, business had picked up significantly. The week after that, they ran out of parking two hours before game time.
The point of the story is that when an issue presented itself, the owner didn’t despair. Instead, they got down to business, thinking creatively about how that challenge might be turned on its head, and into a success.

news_126,news,5 questions to ask before building a website,"Creating a beautiful, effective website that drives business can seem like a formidable project, but considering a few key questions before building (or upgrading) your site will greatly improve customer experience and results. Here are 5 questions to focus your efforts.…",03-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-building-website/,"This post is part of our “5 questions” series, helping merchants ask the right questions before making key business decisions. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
Creating a beautiful, effective website that drives business can seem like a formidable project, but considering a few key questions before building (or upgrading) your site will greatly improve customer experience and results. Here are 5 questions to focus your efforts and make your website more effective:
1. What’s the most important thing your website should convey?
According to Nielsen Norman Group, new visitors to a website spend on average less than a minute reading the site and only scan about 25 percent of the text on a page. That’s not long, and first impressions matter. The first question you should consider is what you want them to know about you even if they only spend a minute on your site. What does your brand stand for? What do you sell? Knowing the answer to this question will help you determine the navigation, content, and overall feeling of your site.
2. What do customers want from your website?
While customers often come to websites for basic information such as prices and a list of services, today’s websites are more than just an online brochure. Customers don’t just want to find a business address, they want directions and an interactive map. They don’t want to see a digital catalog, they want to know if you have that particular item in their favorite color and size in stock at the store near them. Customers expect a level of self-service and interactivity from websites, and they expect to be able to use it anywhere on a mobile device.
It’s unlikely you’ll be able to meet customers’ every wish, but some of these features are easy to create. Start the process by checking out competing stores and the features on their sites. Then make a list of the types of things your customers may want to do on your site. Here’s a short list of possibilities to start brainstorming:
· Make purchases online
· Put in an order
· Make a reservation
· Check in when they arrive or are waiting for an appointment
· Track an order
· Add their names to wait lists
· Chat with customer service
· Leave reviews
· Check their loyalty perks
While not everything on your wish list will make it onto your site, it’s important to view your site as an extension of the overall customer experience and as a business booster. Small changes, like being able to order a coffee while getting off the subway, can turn your business into a local favorite. Offering e-commerce can drive sales outside your local region, and offering push messages letting customers know appointments are available can help fill slow periods.
With a wishlist in hand you can begin research on how difficult it is to build a site with these features. Some website builders go beyond designing a mobile-friendly site. Clover Online Store, for example, can help you create a secure e-commerce website that integrates with your inventory and analytics systems which simplifies many business processes.
3. What key content will attract customers?
A free and effective way to attract new customers is to offer unique, relevant, and useful content. Content attracts customers who may not be ready to buy, but who are researching something online and find your site organically. Compelling content also gets shared via social networks marketing your business through word-of-mouth. For example, a hair salon might offer advice on hairstyles based on the shape of a person’s face. An organic eatery could offer advice on clean eating and a 30-day challenge that includes specials from their menu. This is known as “top-of-funnel” marketing—making potential customers aware of your business and helping them associate it with your product or service. When they are ready to buy, they are more likely to use your business.
Consider your best customers—what types of content attract them to your products and services? Ask customers what they were thinking about when they made the decision to purchase or come in. Also consider what information you can put online that would cut down on needless calls, such as holiday hours.
4. What action do you want customers to take?
Part of good website design is anticipating what customers will want to do, making it easy for them to do it, and eliminating the “noise” of other options. Every page on your site should have a primary call-to-action—such as Buy Now, Request a Trial, or Book an Appointment. The call to action should be obvious, visible, and related to the content on the page. Thinking through the purpose of each page simplifies site navigation.
5. How will you keep the website updated?
Cool features on a site are only cool if they work and are kept up-to-date. Features that don’t work will only frustrate customers. Plan out how you will maintain and update the site on a regular basis. Assign this responsibility to someone on your team and make sure they have tools to make updates easily. It’s a good idea to do a monthly audit of the website to make sure the information is current and reflective of your business.

news_127,news,Getting ready for festival season,The holidays are over. The high foot-traffic summer months are still on the horizon. How to use the relatively quieter spring to plan for festival season.…,06-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/getting-ready-festival-season/,"The holidays are over. The high foot-traffic summer months are still on the horizon. But as a small business owner, you know that any downtime you get is time you can use to plan ahead. So why not use the relatively quieter spring to plan for festival season?
Festivals can happen at any time of year, but they tend to be concentrated in the warmer months, from May to October. In Milwaukee, for example, while there are festivals throughout the year, the vast majority take place from June to September, with 15 events in June alone, including the Milwaukee Highland Games, Pridefest, Polish Fest, Juneteenth Day, and the Lakefront Festival of Art. Businesses need to start planning early in order to get any needed permits or permissions, and to adequately publicize their involvement.
Why bother going to a festival? Attending a special event is a brand-building opportunity. It shows off a business’s connections to the community. A festival aimed at a specific demographic gives you a chance to build goodwill and loyalty with that segment of the population, and potentially expand your customer base. If some of your core products are seasonal, such as iced coffee, ice cream, or street food treats, going to a festival can help you double down on sales during your peak months. Particularly if you’re a one-location business, a public event can give you a chance to reach a new geographic area. You can even use it as a test-drive for expansion to a new location.
Use your lead time to make great choices so you are sure to have maximum impact from a special event. Here are 5 things to do before you set up a booth at a festival:
1. Choose the right event.
Some festivals celebrate a particular segment of the population, some draw a broad cross-section of the community. Some center around a run or other athletic activity, some are all about food, music, or art. Some are smaller, niche events, and some draw in enormous crowds. If you’ve never attended an event like this before, a smaller event might be a good place to start. Look into the different events offered in your area and think about which ones might draw the kind of crowds you’re looking for.
2. Evaluate the opportunity.
If this event has been running for at least a couple of years, talk to some business owners who’ve participated in the past. Did they meet their goals? Was it a good marketing opportunity? Did they learn any lessons they’re willing to share? If this is a new event, participating is more of a gamble. Talk to the event organizers to see if they can offer you anything, such as a discount on fees or a mention on promotional materials, to sweeten the deal.
3. Do your homework.
Contact the event organizers and figure out what kind of paperwork you need to fill out, where you can set up, and what restrictions there might be on your booth or display. You’ll also want to figure out how much you need to sell to break even in terms of staff time, materials, and fees. What are your goals in terms of marketing, generating new leads, and driving traffic to your store after the event? Setting specific goals ahead of time will help you determine whether the event was worth it after the fact.

4. Make a marketing plan.
Of course, you’ll want to publicize your involvement ahead of time so your loyal customers know where to find you at the festival. You can do this with in-store signs and on social media. You’ll also want to plan out how your booth will draw attention on the actual day—what will your signage look like? Can you have staff working the crowd? Can you do any kind of demonstration that will draw the eyes of passersby? Think about what customers will take away from your booth. Try to leave people with a business card, sticker, coupon, or something else that will remind them to visit you again later.
5. Take care of the technical details.
If you’re going to sell off-site, you’re going to want a foolproof system that won’t slow your staff down or discourage customers. If you have a Clover system, a Clover Mobile or a Clover Go are great options for event-based sales. You can accept payments anywhere—even if you’re offline—and all sales data will flow back into your central POS system, so you capture all that valuable customer information.
A festival can be a great opportunity to market your business to new customers and make some sales. But preparation is the key to getting the most out of any opportunity. If you’re thinking of setting up shop at a community event, make sure you’re prepared to unlock its full value.

Spend a few hours outfitting your Clover with these apps and personalizing them.…",07-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/get-rid-clutter-improve-business-efficiency/,"Winter’s cold weather and snow can drive even the most motivated to hunker down and keep everything running on autopilot until springtime buds appear on the trees. But savvy businesspeople that use this dreary (and often, slow) time to do a thorough spring cleaning of their business practices get a jump start on their competitors.
This daunting task can be made easier with a Clover point-of-sale system and its app market, which is stocked with numerous tools that help your company run more efficiently. From automating your inventory to streamlining your employee scheduling and even monitoring various locations, getting rid of outdated practices and updating them with technologically advanced ones just makes sense. Spend a few hours outfitting your Clover with these apps and personalizing them. You’ll gain a stellar return on your investment for the long-term.
What entrepreneur would say “no” to a more orderly and more cost-effective way of doing business?
Time Clock
Maintaining a fully staffed store or quick-serve restaurant can be tricky and time-consuming. But even worse is having an understaffed place of business. Let technology help, and delegate your employee scheduling to this app. Have a worker that wants to trade shifts? Want a better—and consistent—way to track and approve time-off requests? Need to track clock ins/outs and breaks? Time Clock handles all these tasks and more.
Shopventory
A flurry of purchasing occurs in the weeks leading up to Christmas. After the holidays, merchants must endure a blast of exchanges and returns—leaving business owners unsure about their own inventory. Hit refresh on how you do inventory and outsource the tracking to this app. Use it to track items that aren’t moving as fast as you’d like and to know which products have the biggest profit margins.
Age Verification
You don’t want to sully your pristine reputation in the business community by selling age-restricted items to minors. But it can be next to impossible to remember exactly which SKUs require age verification for purchase. Instead of taking the time to memorize this information, rely on technology to do it for you. This app alerts cashiers when someone tries to purchase alcohol, fireworks, tobacco products, aerosol paint, and more. Use it to record a shopper’s age, or if you have a small add-on, scan the person’s ID and store it for future verification.
Commerce Sync
The Pew Research Center reports that half of Americans hate doing their taxes. That’s not at all surprising, considering how incredibly time-consuming and difficult the task is. Even if you have someone complete your returns, tax prep alone can take hundreds of hours. Drastically simplify the process (and make it virtually error-proof) with this app, which automatically transfers sales information into accounting software, like QuickBooks—giving you valuable time to focus on other areas of your business.
HR Resources
As the saying goes, the devil is in the details. And that’s particularly true when it comes to human resources. Major problems can arise if you don’t stay on top of specifics. So as a result, labor management is labor intensive. Maintain quality while reducing the quantity of time you spend on it by tapping the tools and documents accessible via this app. (Think: new hire forms, performance reviews.) Have questions about insurance coverage or employee retention? Hit up the app’s webcasts for expert advice.
Ping Me If
As a business owner, it’s imperative to stay on top of things. But if you’re constantly checking in to see how things are going, you’ll never get a break or take a vacation. (And we all know how healthy it is to take a breather from work.) This foolproof reporting tool seamlessly integrates with your Clover system and allows you to get away without worry. For example, it lets you know if a payment exceeds a specific amount, drawer cash exceeds a predetermined amount, an order remains open too long, and more.
Cash Track
You don’t want to micromanage your workers. But since your business keeps large amounts of cash on hand, you need to know what’s going in and out of your drawers. Instead of manning the register yourself, the Cash Track app tracks how much money each employee and/or register has during the beginning, during, and at the end of a shift. No longer will restaurant managers or owners be forced to spend hours late at night calculating tips; the app calculates how much each employee is due.

news_129,news,Enterprise behavior: Tracking employee performance,"The success of a business ultimately depends on the individual performance of each employee, so it’s important to create a process for evaluating and monitoring key goals to keep everyone on track. Here are a few tips for setting up an effective performance management process.…",08-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-tracking-employee-performance/,"Learn more about the processes, initiatives and habits of enterprise businesses, and how you can adapt those processes to help your small or medium business run better.
Regardless of how many hours a week your employees work, or how many years they have been on your team, it’s a good practice to have regular performance evaluations. The success of a business ultimately depends on the individual performance of each employee, so it’s important to create a process for evaluating and monitoring key goals to keep everyone on track. Here are a few tips for setting up an effective performance management process:
Set goals for employees
When employees first begin, part of their onboarding and training should include establishing specific performance goals so they know what to focus on. Goals can be performance-based (sell at least 5 cars this month), focused on quality or customer service (make sure customers wait no more than 10 minutes to be served), or they can be focused on organizational goals (allocating time to experiment and develop innovations). Regardless of the goal type, make sure goals are SMART—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant to the employee’s position, and Time-based. (Check out the Be It Resolved series for more information on goal-setting.) Goals should be periodically revisited and mentioned in team meetings to make sure they stay top of mind.
Hold team meetings
Another way to encourage staff to continually improve is to hold regular team meetings, even if it’s just 10 minutes before opening. Restaurants often do this to go over the menu for the day and to allow each person on the team to taste the specials. Holding an informal team meeting is a great way to remind employees what you’d like them to focus on, go over anything that has changed recently, and to give feedback on how the team is performing. Meetings also provide opportunities for employees to learn from each other and to celebrate positive behaviors.
At your next team meeting try asking some key questions that foster the right culture such as:

Does anyone have a suggestion for how we can encourage repeat business?
Did anyone try something new to increase sales?
Who would like to report a coworker doing something awesome?

Asking questions subtly lets employees know that you expect them to take ownership of the culture and to always be looking for ways to improve performance and the customer experience.
Set development goals to improve weaknesses
Employees in the same jobs or positions should be held to the same performance standards to ensure fairness. That said, every employee is slightly different and brings a different set of skills to the job. Each employee should have at least one development or “stretch” goal to improve a weakness. Ask the employee to identify at least one skill related to their job that they want to improve. This helps get buy-in from the employee and helps ensure the performance management process is a two-way conversation. Come up with an informal plan with the employee to help them work on the weakness: shadowing a more senior employee, taking a training course, or simply spending an entire work day practicing a skill. As with all goals, spend the time to identify behaviors or outcomes that will demonstrate progress so you know how to measure success.
Reward staff for meeting or exceeding goals
There’s a saying in performance management—you get what you reward. Goals will ultimately be ignored if employees are not held accountable for them, both negatively (through warnings) and positively (through rewards). Rewards can be financial such as a raise or commissions for sales above a target goal, but they don’t have to be. Non-financial rewards can be extremely effective at motivating staff. Consider using methods to engage and motivate staff such as offering time off, flexible hours, the ability to vote on the dress code, allowing them input on other mandatory policies, or discounts on products or services. Similarly, make sure to offer positive feedback when you catch an employee doing something well, especially if the task was difficult such as dealing with an unhappy customer. Positive feedback is a highly underestimated reward—it lets the employee know the boss noticed them doing something right and is an intrinsic motivator.
Establish best practices for your business
Look at your data to figure out which employees sell the best. Software, such as Clover Insights, makes this analysis easy, but you can also determine top-performing employees by examining who earns the highest commissions, the best tips, or who is working when the ticket sales are highest. Make it a point to be present when this employee is working, and take note of any behaviors the employee consistently does that appears to improve sales such as greeting customers soon after they walk in the door. Then ask the employees what they think they are doing differently. Often listening to front-line employees gives you insight into what works and doesn’t work in your business.
Once you have an idea of the key behaviors that help drive sales, train staff to follow the same process so the entire group improves. These behaviors should be part of employee goals.
Take note of what characteristics make this employee a top seller. These characteristics are what you should look for in employees when hiring, so make them part of the job description and vetting process. (See Taking the Work Out of Finding Great Employees and How to Use Personality Styles to Train Employees for more ideas on finding and coaching exceptional employees.)
Don’t be afraid to let some people go
Sometimes employees just don’t work out, despite your best efforts to coach them into higher performance. If it’s not working for you or for the business, ultimately it won’t work for the employee either, so don’t be afraid to let some people go.

Welcome to our monthly roundup of research small businesses can use to do business better.…",09-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-trends-research-roundup-millennial-customers/,"What are the experts, surveys and latest research reports saying about appealing to and retaining millennial customers? Welcome to our monthly roundup of research small businesses can use to do business better.
Who are millennials?

Millennials are now the biggest generation in the U.S., making up more than a quarter of the population. They’re already a big force in consumer spending, and their purchasing power will only grow: about $30 trillion will transfer from Baby Boomers to Gen X and Millennials in the next 10 to 40 years. Edelman’s 2016 Millennials and Money report
Millennials put a high value on having a balanced, healthy lifestyle. They want to understand the companies they’re buying from, and they are willing to pay a premium for products that are sustainable, healthy, and have a positive social impact. Nielsen: The Keys to Unlocking the Millennial Mindset
Millennials are overwhelmingly progressive on social issues. They resist being forced to categorize themselves by things like race, gender, or sexual orientation. National Retail Federation’s Millennial Moment

How Millennials Spend

Millennials spend more on eating outside the home than previous generations, but less on clothes and entertainment. Department of Labor: Spending Habits by Generation
They value experience more than accumulating stuff. That’s one of the reasons they love to travel–and they’re willing to spend on ‘treats’ and impulse buys when they’re traveling. Nielsen: Millennial Travelers Take Off to Shop
Millennials who engage with a brand are more loyal and more profitable than other customers–but they’re hard to win over. They’re just as likely to bad-mouth a brand as they are to sing its praises. A good digital experience is key to winning their loyalty, but you’ve got to back that website up with a great overall experience.

Millennials as Parents

A million millennial women become moms every year. They’ve waited longer than previous generations to have kids, and being parents is very important to them. About 60% of millennials say that “having children is central to their identity.” Pew Research Center
Hipsters—college-educated millennials in urban areas—tend to spend more on themselves, while millennials who are parents tend to spend more on other people. They’re also more likely than other consumers to make donations to causes they care about. PricewaterhouseCooper: 2016 Holiday Outlook
Millennial moms are more likely than other shoppers to comparison-shop, use coupons, look for sales, and find other ways to save money. Still, they’re not above a splurge: they’re equally likely to trade down to a cheaper brand and to ‘trade up’ to a pricier option. Most millennial women are increasingly using coupons and loyalty cards, but millennial men aren’t as likely to use these savvy shopping tools. McKinsey & Company

Get Ready for Gen Z

As millennials are becoming parents, the next generation of young consumers is already making their presence felt: Gen Z. They’re still young—many of them still get their spending money in the form of an allowance—but they already have an impact on buying decisions, particularly food and clothing. They’re digital natives, but they still mostly prefer to shop in stores, and they care a lot about the retail basics: getting good value for their money, having the items they want in stock, and so on.

news_131,news,Merchant Monday: Eyewear Excellence,"Technology can make it easier for entrepreneurs to connect with customers. Here are three ways Clover Mobile helps Richard Hatcher, owner of Eyewear Excellence, make personal connections with his customers.…",13-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/merchant-monday-eyewear-excellence/,"In our personal lives, technology can make it easier to stay connected to far-flung family and friends. It’s easy to maintain relationships when an update on a friend’s kid, cat, or commute to work is just a click away.
Technology can also make it easier for entrepreneurs to connect with customers. Social media and e-commerce mean you can sell to anyone, anywhere, anytime. And for Richard Hatcher, the owner of Eyewear Excellence, technology also makes it easier to connect with the customer standing right in front of him. Here are three ways the Clover Mobile helps Hatcher make personal connections with customers:
It allows him to move around his store.
Face-to-face conversations with customers are crucial when selling a product as appearance-defining as eyeglasses. “I don’t want to keep running back to the desk,” Hatcher says. Disappearing behind a desk to check prices or see if a frame is in stock in a particular color would interrupt his conversations with customers. With all that information at his fingertips, Hatcher can stay focused on making those personal connections that build loyalty—and make sales.
It’s seamless and unobtrusive.
The last thing you want when you’re talking to a customer is technical difficulties slowing you down. If you’re trying to figure out a complicated computer system, you’re not making eye contact with your customer. If your system is sluggish or prone to failure, that adds wait time and frustration to your interactions with customers. A simple, user-friendly, robust system like the Clover Mobile enables you and your staff to keep your focus where it belongs—on making that sale. “I don’t know how you can mess up with the Clover, honestly,” Hatcher says.
It’s a secret weapon.
“The Clover has helped me close a couple of sales,” Hatcher explains. A customer who needs her glasses to see can’t easily see herself when she’s trying on new frames. She might want to go get a friend to help her choose frames—and any time a customer leaves the store, that’s a sale delayed, if not lost forever. With the Clover’s front-facing camera, Hatcher can snap a picture of a customer, and then she can put her glasses back on and get a good look. “Now we’ve saved somebody that may not have come back,” Hatcher says.
The Clover’s camera may not have the same close-the-deal capability for every business, of course, but the dozens of apps in the app store make it customizable for any type of business. What will your secret weapon be?

news_132,news,CoinOut saves merchants the pain of change and keeps customers coming back,"With CoinOut, you can improve your daily efficiencies one transaction at a time, and focus on the things that really matter—your business!
…",15-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/app-feature-coinout-saves-merchants-pain-change-efficiencies-add/,"Learn about even more business apps from the Clover App Market that can expand your Clover device’s capabilities and help you get paid and sell more.
What if merchants could take a tedious business task that consumes an inordinate amount of time–counting, making, and replenishing change–and convert it into a delightful experience that lets merchants reach customers with a single click, and encourages their customers to come back and make repeat purchases?
Enter CoinOut. The innovative mobile and point-of-sale app, which launched in 2016, makes life easier for merchants through a digital piggy bank that makes cash transactions more seamless for everyone involved. As more consumers and merchants use CoinOut, the company has come up with ever more ways to make it an effective loyalty and communication tool for small businesses.
How it works
In a nutshell, cash-paying customers can use CoinOut to save their change using their phone numbers, rather than getting it back in loose coins or bills. If your business offers cash tips, customers can use CoinOut to pay those, too. And in a more recent development, customers can even use the coins they save to make additional purchases with CoinOut.
CoinOut has an integration with Clover that adds a “CoinOut” button next to “Credit” and “Debit” on the register or sale application you currently use to ring up a transaction. If a customer pays with cash, they can choose to “CoinOut” in order to save some or all of their change to their digital piggy bank in a seamless and straightforward transaction.
At the register, the merchant will hit the “CoinOut” button, then swivel the Clover device to the customer, who will enter their phone number to finish their completely coin-less transaction. (If preferred, the merchant can also key in the customer’s phone number on their behalf.)
Building loyalty, and an exciting new way to communicate, with your cash-paying customers
Creating a more convenient experience for yourself and your customers is one thing, but creating an easy pathway for getting those customers back to your business to spend more money is where CoinOut really makes a difference to a business’s bottom line.
Encouraging customer loyalty is one of the most important business activities merchants can undertake in this highly competitive landscape. In addition to encouraging better experiences for both customers and merchants, CoinOut can also help them create customer bonds that, until now, were often lost with cash transactions.
For example, if a customer who uses CoinOut chooses to receive notifications, merchants can pass along promotions, discounts, or simply a nice “thank you” note for visiting the store with a single click. Use this tool in real-time when business traffic is slow in order to get customers through your doors.
Customers have the option to manage their money in a variety of ways, including transferring it into their bank account, an Amazon gift card, or even donating it to charity. But they can also use that money to make more purchases at the business, not only by tipping with their CoinOut wallet, but also by making wholly new purchases.
The kicker: when a customer uses CoinOut to pay for purchases, merchants are not charged a processing fee on those sales. Merchants can also access real-time data about CoinOut sales directly within the app.
Win for the business, win for the customer: merchants get to cross one more tedious task off their lists, develop a loyal customer base and earn more money. As for the customers, they have more ways to pay or save, and yet another reason to love their local merchant.

Jeff Witten is the CEO of CoinOut, which makes cash transactions easier, better and more enjoyable by enabling consumers to save change to their phone. For businesses that have customers that pay with cash, CoinOut reduces the headaches associated with change and provides seamless, integrated and automated reporting to make life easier. Learn more at CoinOut.com, and try a free trial of CoinOut by visiting the Clover App Market.
CoinOut will promote your business via their social media channels to drive customers to your store. They ask you to send them a picture or tag them on Instagram (@CoinOut) so they can repost and get some more visibility for you!

news_133,news,Business scenario: How to fire an employee,"A few commonsense strategies, and advance preparation, can ward off the need to fire someone—or make it as painless as possible for everyone.…",15-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-fire-employee/,"Do you have a sinking feeling that an employee isn’t working out? Is it time to let the person go, or is there some way to turn the performance around?
While no one likes dealing with problem people and behaviors, few business owners can escape them—whether it’s too many absences, trouble interacting with customers, or red-alert actions such as taking money from the till.
While we’re not HR or legal experts, a few commonsense strategies and advance preparations can ward off the need to fire someone—or make it as painless as possible for everyone.
Help employees get on track.
First, think about the environment employees are stepping into. “Nobody comes to work to make mistakes,” writes HR pro Liz Ryan on Forbes.com. “When something goes wrong at work, it’s a learning experience.” And that means for the boss, too.
Are expectations clearly stated and reinforced? Have employees received proper training? While training time is always tight, people still need to know what they’re supposed to do and how to do it.
Yet many are genuinely unsure, as they bumble from mistake to mistake trying to figure out the job. More instruction and more patience from the managerial side can be just what they need to succeed.
For employees trapped in a personality/job mismatch, better communication or training won’t solve the problem. Assess their strengths and weakness using employee performance reporting, and consider reassigning them to new roles, if possible.
Evaluate how big the problem is.
While the magnitude of the problem dictates the response, even smaller offenses can turn into big issues that drag down sales and morale.
One common reason people lose their jobs is missing too much work. While an occasional absence with a good explanation may be acceptable, repeatedly failing to show up needs attention. Talking to employees to find out what’s going on, collaborating to create workable schedules, and allowing staff to swap shifts are small steps that can help.
If problems like absenteeism persist, most HR pros recommend progressive discipline. That means taking incremental steps to alert employees, whether part-time or full-time, that their behavior needs to change. The process might start with a verbal warning, proceed to a written warning, then a suspension, and finally termination, each thoroughly documented in writing to avoid legal exposure.
When it’s really bad, act swiftly.
Other problems, though, such as stealing, drinking on the job, and harassing coworkers or customers, require an immediate response. In these cases, progressive discipline is far too slow. The employee must be let go quickly and clearly. Resist engaging in arguments with the employee.
Firing someone for cause requires equally quick communication with the team. Be transparent and calmly tell them what happened, without recriminations or gossipy details. Don’t breach anyone’s privacy, but also don’t let rumors fester.
For many employees, especially high-functioning ones, removing weak teammates creates a more positive workplace and alleviates frustration. “The most common complaint of unfair treatment in the workplace comes from management’s failure to deal with poor work behavior and poor performance,” notes a human performance expert.
In sum, be compassionate and try to help when you can. But be brave and act swiftly when you must.

news_134,news,5 ways payments technology is transforming shopping,"Here are five ways that payment technology is enabling better, smoother transactions for customers—as well as smarter insights into buying behavior for merchants.…",16-02-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-ways-payments-technology-transforming-shopping/,"As a sponsor of National Merchant Day, First Data is excited to help merchants both big and small discover all of the new ways payment technology is evolving for the better. With that in mind, this post will take a look at five ways that payments technology is enabling better, smoother transactions for customers—as well as smarter insights into buying behavior for merchants.
It’s become clear that payments technology is way more important to business success than merely allowing merchants to accept credit cards. In fact, this somewhat innocuous, ‘under-the-hood’ functionality is a surprisingly large differentiator for merchants seeking to provide an outstanding shopping experience for customers. Without further ado, let’s examine the five ways payments technology is transforming shopping—and what that means for you and your business.
1. More convenience
When it comes to shopping, easy is everything. Now, more than ever, customers want to shop how, when, and where they want. So, how do you deal with the ever-expanding expectations of being able to pay using smartphones and mobile devices? You start by choosing payments processing that has the capability to accept technology like Samsung Pay and Apple Pay. Once you’re able to consistently deliver a shopping experience that embraces various customer preferences, you’re well on your way to securing lifelong customers. (More on loyalty in a bit.)
2. More security
With the proliferation of hacking, phishing, and scamming in today’s marketplace, security continues to be of the utmost importance. That’s why it’s so critical for your business to accept EMV chip cards. What’s at stake if you don’t? Card fraud liability, for one. (And, depending on the amount of the transaction, that’s no small matter.) But it goes far beyond just protecting your business from liability. It’s also become equally important you address customers’ growing concerns about the security of their credit card information. Knowing your business has made the transition to this more-secure payment platform is one more reason security-minded customers would choose to do business with you rather than risk it elsewhere.
3. More connection
For most merchants, return customers are the lifeblood of their business. The equation is simple: customer shops store + store rewards customer = happy customer returns. The best way to capitalize on this fact is to ensure you have a loyalty program in place. Luckily, most of today’s smart payment terminals have loyalty programs already built-in, like Clover Rewards. It makes it easy for you to set up a system that helps you treat your customers to the personalized deals and attention they crave. It even lets you customize rewards with a points- or punch-based system and then choose rewards and loyalty levels that match your goals—and your customers’ tastes. Loyalty programs can revolutionize your approach to customer relationship management.
4. More engagement
Much in the same way a loyalty program rewards return customers, a gift card program can be instrumental in helping win new ones. How? They allow someone who might be outside a business’s target audience to come in and do business with a store or shop to give a gift to someone they love. Not only do they attract new customers, but it’s widely understood that customers are more likely than not to spend over and above the value of their gift card. Clover Gift Cards is a simple way to let your business sell digital and plastic gift cards. Again, it’s all about choice in the shopping experience—the more you offer, the more customers you’ll attract and engage.
5. More innovation
As you well know, apps make the world go around. But did you know it can be especially true for merchants? Check out some of these payments innovations and see how they’re transforming the shopping experience.
· Paywiz makes bill-splitting easier for consumers, while retaining individual customer insights and reducing associated headaches for merchants.
· Sezzle is a debit card that rewards like a credit card.
· Happy Returns is fixing the broken e-commerce returns process.
· CoinOut makes cash transactions easier by enabling consumers to save change to their phone—no more fumbling around the cash drawer.
Any one of these by itself could dramatically influence how customers perceive your shopping experience. But combining them leaves you empowered to make your shopping experience as pleasant and as memorable as possible.
As payments technology continues to evolve, it’s important for merchants to stay abreast with the latest and greatest. You’ll deliver more convenience, security, connection, engagement and innovation than you ever thought possible.

As with everything Clover, our goal is always to help you get paid, sell more, and run your business better. That’s why we’re constantly updating the Clover App Market with apps to do just that. For this month, we’d like to highlight three of the new and updated apps now available through your Clover device.
Gusto Payroll Integration
Who doesn’t want easier payroll integration? With its easy-to-use payroll software, friendly US-based customer support, and focus on helping your business stay compliant, it’s easy to see why more than 40,000 companies across the US have chosen Gusto.
Gusto lets you automate local, state, and federal tax payments to help with compliance while letting employees self-onboard with automatic collection of I-9s, W-4s, and direct deposits. It also gives you a single system of record with an intuitive employee directory and document storage along with easy time-off tracking that integrates with your payroll. Best of all, Gusto seamlessly integrates with financial software like Quickbooks, Xero, and Freshbooks.
Although the app is free to install, it does require additional onboarding once a Gusto connection has been established via Clover. Clover merchants receive a special free trial, so try it out and see how much time it saves you.
Order Timer
Running your restaurant better comes down to how efficiently you can place and process orders. That’s why there’s Order Timer. It shows the front and back of the house how much time is left for them to make an order, ultimately improving customer satisfaction by getting orders out in a timely fashion.
Order Timer lets you set up timers based on days of week and time of day, as well as using different durations based on busy and slow times. It features a lot of the same functionality as the “Orders” app, but with additional features. Order Timer reminds you that the second most important attribute of a fast food business is how fast the food is prepared—the first, of course, being taste.
Health Plans
Providing healthcare for employees continues to be a hot-button topic. Health Plans puts individual health insurance plans at your fingertips and allows employees to access health insurance plans directly from the Clover device.
It’s now easier than ever for you to instantly compare more than 12,000 individual and family health insurance plans to find the one that’ll save you the most money. You can read over the easy to understand plans, benefits, and premiums, and then determine if you qualify for big government discounts. And if you have any questions, you can talk to a health insurance expert anytime.

These are just three of the more than 150+ apps in the Clover App Market. Feel free to check these out, or go browse more. Whatever you find is sure to help you get paid, sell more, and run your business better.

On Employee Appreciation Day, business owners and managers around the country do something a little extra to show their employees how much they appreciate their hard work.
If you haven’t decided how you’ll celebrate yet, we’ve got a few ideas you can deploy on this day, and whenever else you want to do a little more to show your employees how important they are to you and your business:
1. Order (or cook) some food and serve your employees
If you’re short on time, it’s okay to keep it simple. Throw a pizza party after work (or before, if you’re running a restaurant), or cook something special for your team. Does your mom have the best mac and cheese recipe in the world? Or the best brownies? Show your employees you care–and show off your unique talents in the kitchen–by sharing something personal with them.
Another approach: partner with fellow local business and plan a family meal or gift card swap. That way, they can learn about your business, you can learn about theirs, and everyone feels like they are appreciated. A true win/win.
Either cooking, ordering in, or restaurant swapping, sharing food is a great opportunity to serve your team with the same enthusiasm they serve customers every day.
2. Plan a team-building activity, like an escape room.
A fun team activity is a great choice, especially if you’ve got younger employees. Escape rooms, bowling nights, batting cages or laser tag tournaments are some options your team is sure to love, and help to increase employee satisfaction and team bonding. Depending on your budget, you may even consider inviting your employees’ family members to join in on the fun.
3. Help your team reach their goals with some fun “continuing education.”
Plan a wine tasting, a butchery class, or the like — it’s a fun way to broaden the horizons of your employees, and it could even help your business. Maybe there’s a budding sommelier or butcher on your team!
4. Volunteer together.
Find a local cause your team supports, and plan a day of giving back. It’s a free team building activity that also helps your community. Consider setting up a group volunteer trip to a local animal shelter, food bank, or nursing home. And don’t feel shy about sharing your good work on social media — your customers will probably appreciate knowing that you give back.
5. Showcase your team’s special talents and make them the star.
Maybe your cashier is also a yogi and can host a yoga class for your other employees. Or maybe your server does woodworking on the side and can teach the basics. It’ll take a bit of research, but most likely, members of your team have some unique talents beyond being great employees.
If you’ve got one or two employees willing to showcase their talents, plan an afternoon around them. If the talents aren’t quite teachable, or if you’ve just got a whole lot of employees to feature, host a talent show.
No matter how you choose to celebrate your staff on Employee Appreciation Day, we know they’ll appreciate it. But start planning now — Employee Appreciation Day is March 3rd.

Here’s how he used technology to deliver top-notch customer experiences through his company, Cheaper Than A Geek.

Chris Barber has always loved computers.
Twenty years ago, he was tinkering around at home and decided to build his own computer from scratch. Two weeks later, he was finished—and he was thrilled. But he was decidedly less so when it soon broke down and he couldn’t figure out why. After taking it to a local repair place, he experienced terrible customer service and felt dramatically overcharged. He was appalled by the entire experience and thought he could do better. It was in that moment that Maryland-based Cheaper Than A Geek was born.
Now, two decades later, Chris proudly sports the title of Chief Nerd. It means a lot to him, mainly serving as a reminder to always focus on delivering customer service first and foremost. In fact, his entire business is built upon the notion of helping businesses and consumers make technology work for them at an affordable price. He likens it to a fireman saving the kitten from the tree. By being real and approachable with their customers, Cheaper Than A Geek has helped fill a void in the IT space by ensuring a positive customer experience.
In the last five years, the industry has changed dramatically. Part of that change has come with how Cheaper Than A Geek does business itself. Of course, they’re still dedicated to ultimate customer service and satisfaction. But they’ve tried to streamline their processes. And, by switching their point-of-sale system over to Clover Go, they were able to do just that.
By its very nature, Cheaper Than A Geek is mobile. They have to be out in the field in order to better accommodate the active lifestyles of their customers. By embracing Clover Go, they’ve found an easy-to-use system that allows them to speed through their customer transactions while maintaining the highest levels of card and data security. And because the associated fees are so low, they’re also seeing a higher return on investment.
As a technology resource, Cheaper Than A Geek was also fortunate to beta test some of the Clover Go apps and interfaces. Chris said he was impressed with how much First Data took his suggestions to heart. In fact, the current dashboard owes some of its polish to the talented nerds at Cheaper Than A Geek.
Today, they also use the Clover Insights app to provide snapshots of their business performance. It’s allowed them to shift from monthly to weekly to daily reports. They’ve found this more granular approach helps the business run better and helps them customize their workflow accordingly. As Chris says, “What doesn’t get measured doesn’t get managed.”
As they work towards the future, Cheaper Than A Geek has set some lofty goals. They want to go from their current state of being the most awarded IT firm in Maryland to being the largest IT provider in the country, and believe their Clover system can help them get there. With its real-time, actionable information, they’re able to track the effectiveness of their marketing efforts by completing the feedback loop to know how they generated each customer.
Armed with reliable technology and reliable vendors, Chris believes his business is doing its part to happily humanize the IT world. Knowing his Clover Go always works, he can approach each day confident in his ability to deliver on Cheaper Than A Geek’s brand promise: ultimate IT customer service for less.

Since then, the couple has learned a few lessons about how to make a successful small business run even better. One of their biggest takeaways: sometimes there’s great power in simplicity.

Many times when small businesses get started, there’s a period where proprietor’s eyes can be bigger than their appetites when it comes to technology investments.
This was the case for Justin & Brie Henshaw at their business Fuse Frozen Yogurt in St. Simons Island, Georgia. While it didn’t take long for the couple’s original concept to take off with customers, the first point-of-sale system they tried was way more than they needed.
For small businesses, there is power in simplicity for business technology
“We used to have a very in-depth, very complicated, very expensive system that we used to use, and I wanted to find a better way,” said Justin of their first point-of-sale.
After seeking a much simpler solution in Clover, things began to run much more smoothly.
Often, the problem with many enterprise-scale point-of-sale systems is that there is just too much functionality. While it might be able to do everything under the sun, they can also be a beast to manage, requiring more overhead from already-strained small business owners and managers.
But with a much simpler, streamlined solution, small businesses can focus on the one or two features that really make the most sense for their business, allowing them to focus on the functions that are most important to their growth.
Fuse used gift cards to build both a following and loyalty
At Fuse, that meant focusing on gift cards.
After looking into the gift card options available with Clover, Fuse found out just how important gift cards could be to bringing in new customers and bringing old ones back.
“The more research we did into gift cards, the more we realized having a gift card option allows us to reach a lot of new customers, but also we have a lot of really loyal customers that it brings back in more regularly as well,” said Brie.
In addition to the new customer marketing that gift cards can accomplish, and the added bonus of word-of-mouth marketing that will almost always follow, there’s an additional way that gift cards can help market a small business: loyalty marketing.
Just as Brie said, gift cards can be instrumental in bringing in regular customers more often–they’re a way to reward regular customers on the spot, and can also be used in lieu of cash refunds, ensuring that even if a customer leaves without a purchase, they have an incentive to come back to spend again another day.
For Fuse, the keys to unlocking success at their shop were simplification and focus. By paring down functionality in their point-of-sale, and then focusing on the most beneficial elements for their business, Fuse was able to expand their customer base, bring regulars back more often, and offer customers more ways to pay–making this St. Simons small business a sweet success.
The lesson for small businesses: pick one or two tactics to get new customers or bring existing ones back, and master the ins and outs of those tactics.

But acting too rashly can do more harm than good. Here are six ways to manage negative reviews for the betterment of your business.…,01-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-turning-complaints-phenomenal-customer-service-experience/,"This post is part of our Business Problem Turnaround series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
No one likes getting a negative review. They can leave business owners feeling desperate to turn the situation around and restore their reputation before it hurts the business financially. Poorly handled situations can escalate to a negative online review very quickly, so it’s important to prepare staff and have a complaint policy in place. Here are six ways to avoid negative reviews.
1. Establish a complaint policy.
Complaint policies help businesses respond quickly and appropriately to customer complaints so they are less likely to escalate.
A basic Complaint Policy includes:

How to record a complaint. This may seem obvious, but employees should write down not just the negative experience, but the contact information of the customer as well. Some complaint policies require the customer to fill out the complaint in their own words. Other policies require the manager to facilitate recording the events objectively.
What to tell the customer. Customers should be briefed on how the complaint will be handled and when to expect a response. This helps set up the customers’ expectations and reassures them that they are being taken seriously.
Who should be notified. Make sure that employees know to inform the manager on duty of any grievance as soon as it takes place. The chain of command should be very clear. The manager should approach the customer and apologize for the negative experience and offer to help.
How the investigation should unfold. If a complaint deals with a service rep or staff member, that employee should be given the chance to let their side of the story be known. This part of the investigation
What actions are appropriate. Is there a satisfaction guarantee? Does the customer get their money back or store credit? Having a policy helps empower employees to resolve the problem immediately and can help restore the relationship quickly.

2. Make the complaint policy public.
Make it easy for customers to communicate their dissatisfaction. Customers should know exactly how to contact managers (without having to ask) to lodge a complaint. Clover Feedback allows customers to have a conversation with the manager to report issues and get them resolved privately before they get out of hand.
3. Investigate all complaints.
Don’t wait for a complaint to make it to social media review sites. Ask customers if they are happy with the products and services and listen carefully to what they say. What is a minor complaint to one customer may be a big issue to another. Even when a complaint is unfair, businesses can often learn from a negative customer experience. They can develop ways to ensure stellar customer service or even innovate new products and services to meet customer demand. A full investigation helps managers experience a business the way a customer would to predict and avoid potential negative experiences before they happen.
4. Train the staff.
All employees should know how to handle a negative experience. They should be trained to lodge, investigate, and resolve problems professionally. Don’t just review the complaint policy with them—role play a few common negative experiences so employees can practice how to handle unhappy customers. The more practice they get, the better prepared they will be for demanding customers.
5. Monitor all review sites.
Come up with a strategy to make sure you’re continually monitoring the key sites such as Yelp!, Facebook, TripAdvisor, and Urbanspoon so you can respond to bad reviews swiftly.
6. Continually review the customer experience.
Customer complaints are a great source of valuable feedback. They give insight into the expectations and frustrations of customers. The better you understand your customers’ needs the better your customer experience will be, so think like an undercover boss and experience the business the way your customers do.
Taking these six proactive steps will help prevent negative reviews before they happen. Stay tuned in this series for more advice on how to handle negative reviews.

news_141,news,5 questions to ask before booking private events,"Before your business jumps into hosting private events, make sure you’ve got a solid plan for pulling them off. Five questions to ask before you take bookings.…",02-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-booking-private-events/,"This post is part of our “5 questions” series, helping merchants ask the right questions before making key business decisions. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
Do you ever host private events? If you’re running a successful restaurant or bar, chances are good that at least one customer has asked you this question. And even if you’re working in another industry, you may have gotten the question from a customer who just loves your space, or has a unique idea for a corporate retreat or an offbeat wedding.
Private events can be a great way to promote your business, build deeper connections with your best customers, and boost revenue on a traditionally slow night. But there are plenty of potential pitfalls to watch out for. Book the wrong night, and you might lose revenue, or alienate regular customers who suddenly can’t get their usual Friday night dinner reservation. Bungle the planning, and you’ll generate bad word of mouth that could affect your underlying business.
Before you jump into hosting an event, make sure you’ve got a solid plan for pulling it off. Here are 5 questions to ask before you book a private event:
1. Where do private events fit into your marketing strategy?
A private event can be a great way to showcase what your business does best and connect on a deeper level with some loyal customers. A couple who holds their wedding reception at your restaurant is likely to come back for regular visits, assuming everything goes well. And event guests who haven’t visited your business before will get a great introduction to who you are and what you’re capable of.
If this is your first time hosting an event, look at it as a test case. This could be a great way to promote your business, but only if you work all the angles. Who from your staff will be on site during the event? What opportunities will you have to promote your business or make connections with potential customers? If you’re hosting a corporate cocktail party, you might have a chance to hand out coupons or mingle and chat with the guests. If it’s a wedding, explicit promotion will feel tacky—the quality of your service will have to speak for itself. Whatever the type of event, ask in advance if you’ll be able to use photos in future promotions or on social media.
2. Who’s organizing, planning, and managing the event?
You’ll need to answer this question on both sides—who from your own staff is running the show, and who’s the point person on the customer’s side. It’s best to designate one point person on each side, so that the lines of communication are clear and nothing gets lost.
Planning an event can be a stressful and nerve-wracking experience. Keep in mind that your customer is likely to be anxious about getting all the details in order and making sure guests have a good time. Constant communication should be your goal. Never make the customer chase after you for information.

3. Are you charging enough?
If you’re closing your business during a time you’d normally be open to the public, you need to make sure that you’re charging enough to cover your lost revenue. Make sure you check a community calendar to ensure you’re not closing your bar on the night of the big game, or otherwise giving up on a big opportunity.
Of course, you’ll also want to figure out what hosting the event will cost you, so your fee covers staffing, food and drink if you’re providing it, and so on. Shop around in your area to make sure that your fee is in line with what similar venues in your community are charging.
4. What’s your timetable?
Especially if you’re new to hosting events, make sure you’re giving yourself plenty of time to plan. Make a calendar for when key decisions will be made and milestones will be met and get your client’s buy-in, so everyone understands what has to be done, when. Don’t forget to build in time for the client to test out any audio-visual equipment they’ll need. If any outside vendors are involved (for food, beverages, equipment rentals, and so on), build in time for those vendors to walk through the space and talk to your point person about what they’ll need. And always add extra time to your calendar in case any problems come up.
5. Have you covered all the details?
Before you move forward with an event, make sure you understand all the legal requirements. If you don’t normally serve food or alcohol, do you need to get any new insurance, or a liquor license? Will outside vendors’ insurance cover damage to your facilities or injury to guests while they’re on the property? Will your event be in compliance with building codes, fire safety, etc.?
You’re going to want to create and sign a formal contract with the client outlining who’s responsible for what, including who is insured to cover what liabilities. Get a deposit when the contract is signed to cover your costs in case anything goes wrong—and ensure the client is serious.

news_142,news,6 tips for standing out on St. Patrick’s Day,More than half of Americans join in on St. Patrick’s Day celebrations each year. Here are six ways to celebrate the popular holiday at your business.…,06-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/standing-st-patricks-day/,"This post is part of our Marketing & Promotions for small business series. Explore more better business tips and tactics here on the Clover blog.
St. Patrick’s Day is more than shamrocks and green beer.
More than 1,500 years ago, a young man left Roman England for the Emerald Isle. Today, Saint Patrick is celebrated in both quiet and raucous celebrations across the world, a testament to the great journeys and global influence of the Irish.
In the United States, census data shows that nearly 40 million people claim Irish ancestry, with many concentrated on the Northeast coast. On March 17th, that cultural tent grows even larger, with more than half of Americans join in on St. Patrick’s Day celebrations.
This gives merchants a great opportunity to attract new customers and build relationships with regulars. According to the National Retail Federation, consumers in the United States spend $4.4 billion on St. Patrick’s Day—a spring boost not just for bars and restaurants, but also retail stores and other establishments.
What twists can be added to make the celebration memorable? Here are some off-the-beaten-path ideas to draw people in and forge stronger relationships with existing clientele.
Delight the kids with a great story.
Children and parents alike appreciate a break from their routines. Traditional Irish storytelling can lure them into a bookstore, gift shop, or other retail location, while providing a welcome half-hour of entertainment. This library of children’s stories is a great place to find ready-to-read folklore and tales of adventures that will capture imaginations.
Hide four-leaf clovers in your store.
Scavenger hunts are another fun activity for all ages. Hide four-leafed clovers, either downloaded or stenciled on paper, in nooks and crannies throughout the store. Send people through the aisles in search of a lucky clover. Winning customers might receive discounts, coupons, or treats as rewards, while merchants plant memories in customers’ minds.
Start the meal with soda bread.
Many restaurants offer traditional items such as shepherd’s pie or Irish stew on St. Patrick’s Day. But any food establishment can add a touch of Ireland with a simple starter such as Irish soda bread. With buttermilk as a key ingredient, this no-fuss bread is a staple of Irish diets.
Offer an alcohol-free option.
While the whiskey and beer flow freely on St. Paddy’s Day, not everyone wants booze with their festivities, particularly designated drivers. Creating a special green “mocktail” for non-drinking revelers lets everyone get in on the fun, while signaling safety and responsibility.
Bring on the fiddles.
Irish folk music is some of the most foot thumping, heart soaring music ever written. Bars and restaurants might consider booking a group to perform during peak hours, while any location can pipe in tunes. Check out YouTube’s many live recordings from the Irish pub scene, or download free fiddle songs to create a spirited playlist.
Offer discounts for wearing green.
Nothing says St. Paddy’s Day like something green. In fact, wearing green is the single most popular way that Americans celebrate the holiday. Tap this long-standing custom by offering 5% discounts to any customer wearing a green item. It’s an easy way to say thank-you for frequenting a business.
While Friday, March 17, marks St. Patrick’s Day, the month offers other holiday tie-ins as well. Check out the March promotional calendar to locate opportunities to celebrate. And get a head start on the year’s event planning by reading the latest research about holiday buying trends and projections for 2017.

news_143,news,Business Problem Turnaround: Dealing with bad reviews (Part 2),"Negative online reviews can feel like a nightmare come true, and responding to them carelessly can haunt you. Here are 7 things you should never do when responding to online reviews, and what to do instead.…",08-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-dealing-bad-reviews-part-2/,"This post is part of our Business Problem Turnaround series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
Negative online reviews can feel like a nightmare come true. Unfortunately, some merchants give in to the impulse to respond in kind. A negative review won’t, in and of itself, sink a business, but how you respond to it can haunt you. Customers know you can’t please everyone and that not all reviews are real or reasonable. The way you respond to reviews is important, and customers expect you to be professional. Here are 7 things never to do, and what to do instead.
1. Don’t delete the post.
Unfortunately, some merchants believe they can simply delete the bad review and the problem will go away. Deleting bad reviews seems like an easy way out, but it can easily backfire. Dealing with a bad review openly gives a business credibility. It gives the business a chance to shine and demonstrate they have superior customer service. Remember: customers post public reviews because they want to be heard. Deleting their post takes away their voice and is likely to make them even more frustrated and determined. Trying to hide a negative review might even inspire a troll who turns a one-off negative review into an entrenched public battle that can further hurt your reputation. Unless the post is defamatory it’s much better to be transparent that there was a complaint and that you did your best to address it. Customers know that occasionally there are mishaps or just plain ornery clients. Leaving the original complaint and trying to address it openly adds credibility to the other, more positive reviews of your business.
Do encourage everyone to leave reviews.
Ask for reviews as a regular part of doing business. Put up signs or put notes on your receipts. While it’s considered bad practices to specifically ask for positive reviews, having many honest and fair reviews will minimize the damage from a negative review. Consider appealing to loyal customers with a sign that says: “We rely on word of mouth—please let us know how we’re doing with a review.”
2. Don’t ignore it.
That will only send the message that you don’t care.
Do respond as soon as possible.
Bad feelings fester when not dealt with in a reasonable amount of time. Demonstrate your dedication to good customer service by responding promptly. A customer complaint about an incorrect order or a mistake can be easily resolved with a quick message back: “We’re so sorry—please come back and we’ll make sure we get your order right.” Even better is to encourage customers to communicate with you privately, for example engaging in a private discussion with a store manager using a free app such as Feedback.
3. Don’t argue.
Focus the conversation instead on uncovering what triggered the customer’s response and rooting out what really needs to be addressed to make them happy.
Do validate their response.
Focus on the customer’s feelings first. Show some empathy and connect with the customer emotionally. Acknowledge and validate their response to the situation, even if it seems overblown. A quick— “Oh no, that must have been really frustrating,” or “I can see why that might’ve been confusing” can help disarm anger.
4. Don’t try to resolve complex issues online.
If a customer complains about an employee or something more complicated than “you forgot my fries,” you should try to investigate and resolve it in private, not on a public site where every word is recorded.
Do get into the details…privately.
Apologize, sincerely and succinctly, online. Keep the public response short, courteous, and concerned: “I’m so sorry to hear you left unhappy. Please contact me—I’d like to talk to you more about this.” Make sure to invite the customer in to resolve the issue in person. It’s easier to read a person’s mood and responses when you can see their body language, and people are often less aggressive face-to-face than on an anonymous site. If the conflict is happening on the shop floor, say “I’m really sorry that happened. It’s loud here—why don’t we step into my office where it’s quiet and I can hear you better,” or “If you don’t mind I’d like to take some notes for my manager—can we go to my office for a moment?”
5. Don’t respond to jibes.
Ignore remarks that are meant to get a rise out of you. Instead, make it a point to use neutral language that is not likely to provoke an emotional response.
Do take the high road.
Accusations bring out the worst in everyone. No matter how heated the situation is, respond calmly and politely. Reassure the customer that you’ll address the problem and try to keep the conversation focused on positive outcomes. If the customer is making defamatory or subjective statements about the staff or products, sometimes a neutral statement like “can you clarify what you mean by that,” or “I’m not sure I understand—tell me more” can give you the details you need to deal with the situation effectively.
6. Don’t debate small details.
Let the customer talk and actively listen to what they say, even if it seems inaccurate.
Do get to the root of the issue.
Ask the customer to start from the beginning and walk you through what happened. Hearing the full story in the words of the customer will help you uncover expectations and new opportunities to make things right. It can also reveal ways to turn the situation into a superior customer service experience. Is the customer upset because the dish had something in it that wasn’t on their diet? Perhaps it’s an opportunity to create new specials or you replace the dish with something custom for the customer. Was the customer trying to find the perfect birthday gift? Maybe a return or money-back guarantee isn’t as satisfying as a one-on-one consultation resulting in the perfect gift.
7. Don’t assume the complaint is a one-off.
Fully investigate the issue to see whether your business is meeting your customers’ expectations.
Do thank the customer.
for being open and honest with you. It’s far better to have a customer tell you directly then hearing about it online or through the grapevine. Thanking them also ends the interaction on a positive note.
Every business has moments where they didn’t perform up to customer expectations. Take negative reviews for what they are—moments to reflect on your business and make it better. For more advice on how to avoid negative reviews check out our other post in this series.

Check out our monthly roundup of research that will help you make your business better.…,14-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-trends-research-roundup-developing-great-employees/,"What does the research say about developing great employees? What training programs or managerial actions are most effective? Check out our monthly roundup of research that will help you make your business better.
Who’s focused on training–and why?

Finding qualified workers is hard–41% of small business owners say it’s hard to find the workers they need, and a third of them say workers would prefer jobs at bigger companies. Perhaps as a result, more small business owners (38%, compared to 23% in 2014) are saying they’re planning to invest in training and employee development. Bank of America Small Business Owner Report, Spring 2015


Retail businesses of all sizes are offering training and leadership development programs for their employees. In one survey, 59% of retail organizations said they offer leadership development programs, and almost 75% said they help pay for external training programs for staff. Retail Council of Canada

Are your employees looking to leave?

Employee turnover has been increasing over the past couple of years as the economy slowly improves. In one survey, 70% of workers who were a high turnover risk said they felt they would have to leave their company to advance their careers. In other words, when workers don’t see an opportunity to advance, they’ve got one foot out the door. Towers Watson 2014 Global Workforce Study


According to Gallup, 51% of workers are actively looking for a new job. Top reasons why workers leave jobs include looking for opportunities to advance, not liking their manager or the company culture, and, of course, pay. Gallup


What keeps people sticking around at a company? The number one thing people say they look for in a job is the opportunity to do the things they do best. Workers also value stability, work-life balance, and working for a company with a great reputation. Gallup

How to keep employees engaged

Giving your employees opportunities to use their strengths at work is crucial. Workers who use their best skills every day are six times more likely to be engaged employees. According to Gallup’s research, lifting up  workers’ strengths is more effective than trying to help them improve on their weaknesses. Gallup


Managers make a huge difference in employee engagement. Great managers are good communicators and meet regularly with their direct reports, and they set clear goals for employees, so workers always know what’s expected of them. Harvard Business Review


In order to effectively train your staff to improve, make sure your managers have enough time to focus on employee development. Make employee development plans customized to individual workers, and give them ownership over their own advancement plans. Harvard Business Review

The bottom line

Unfortunately, not everyone has the talent to effectively manage people. Only about 10% of people have the talent to lead employees to excellent performance. Gallup


Focusing on employee engagement and making sure your staff is happy isn’t just a nice-to-have. Happy people are actually 12% more productive at work–so a happy worker is a better worker. University of Warwick

But opening a second location can often bring surprises. Before signing that new lease, we’ve jotted down a few things to consider to make sure you get off on the right foot.
Hire a manager.
Having a second location can be more than twice the work as having one. Sure, you’ve timed the drive down to the minute at multiple times of day from your current location to the new one—planning ahead for that eventual emergency—but it’s physically impossible to be everywhere at once.
It’s important to know what questions to ask when hiring that second location’s manager, so look for some advice to ensure you get the job done right the first time.
Create infrastructure to manage inventory and staff across locations.
Nobody loves doing the arduous task of tracking inventory, but with the inevitable inability to keep all the plates spinning yourself, it’s important you put a well-thought out plan in place to do the job across your multiple locations.
Fortunately, there are a number of sleek new apps available for just this purpose. For example, Shopventory helps multi-location businesses track inventory, optimize stock, and create condition-based inventory alerts and purchase orders. Additionally, it includes a convenient analytics dashboard allowing you to track profit margin by item, run reports across items, categories, and locations.
When it comes to managing staff or changing prices on an item, look to technology again. Apps like Multi-Location put business owners in control, enabling real-time pricing and menu changes, management of employees and remote scheduling, and more.
You’ll need to make sure customers come through the door at your new location.
Imperative to the success of your new location will be putting a plan in place to bring people through the door.
Marketing plans come in varying levels of complexity, from simple ad buys in search, social, and in local media, to a focused, content-centric social media plan leveraging valuable, branded content. A successful plan encourages your current audience to connect with new customers closer to the new store, and might even use a customer relationship management system to send targeted Promos to current customers that live closer to your new location.

Opening a second location isn’t an easy thing to do, but with the resources in the Clover App Market, it’s more streamlined than ever before.

news_146,news,"Thanks to Clover, Savannah food trucks accept cashless payments for the first time at the annual St. Patrick’s Day Festival","This year marks the 192nd celebration for the city of Savannah, and Clover’s debut as an official sponsor for the event. How Clover helped participating food trucks get paid and sell more.…",16-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/thanks-clover-savannah-food-trucks-accept-cashless-payments-first-time-annual-st-patricks-day-festival/,"Every year, hundreds of thousands of visitors travel from around the world to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day in Savannah. In fact, Savannah’s celebration is the 4th largest in the U.S., behind New York, Chicago, and Boston, with between three and five hundred thousand people attending the three-day festival. This year marks the 192nd celebration for the city of Savannah, and Clover’s debut as an official sponsor for the event.
Related post: 6 tips for standing out on St. Patrick’s Day
As part of the sponsorship, the festival’s food truck park has been outfitted with Clover devices, enabling those businesses – and the festival organizers – to take cashless payments for the first time. With the Clover hardware, businesses can not only accept card transactions, but also EMV or NFC-enabled payments. Additionally, the business owners are able to access the Clover platform, which includes a variety of solutions, including analytics tools, as well as more than 250 business management apps that are available on the Clover App Market.
One of the organizations benefitting from Clover is the Savannah Downtown Business Association (SDBA), which supports economic growth for local Savannah small businesses and organizes the annual festival. Festival goers are required to purchase a wristband from the SDBA, and those wristband sales sustain that non-profit’s activities year-round.
“The funds we generate St. Patrick’s Day weekend truly benefit our community throughout the year,” said Gina Peper, SDBA board member and one of the organizers. “Being able to take non-cash payments will be huge for us. Cash is often in short supply at the festival, and with Clover, we can now take non-cash payments, so that we won’t miss out on any opportunities to raise more money for our local businesses.”
St. Patrick’s Day is big business for the small business owners in Savannah, where that one weekend can represent a huge chunk of their annual revenue. In 2016, Savannah restaurants saw average ticket sizes rise for the third year in a row during the 10-day period surrounding St. Patrick’s Day, hitting $28.27—up more than $4 from 2014—according to First Data. Collected in a special First Data SpendTrend Report—a macro-economic indicator based on aggregate same store sales activity across the four million merchant locations First Data processes transactions for in the U.S.—First Data found St. Patrick’s Day offers local merchants a pot o’ gold as bar tabs and restaurant tickets rise for the holiday.
Savannah bars and restaurants should prepare for a rush. Last year Savannah bars saw transaction volume rise on St. Patrick’s Day by nearly one-quarter (24 percent) above average sales during the 10-day period surrounding the holiday, with an even bigger lift (42 percent) the Saturday following the 17th. Restaurants can also expect a rise, with 2016 transaction volume lifting 41 percent the Saturday following the St. Patrick’s Day holiday.
Jack Johnson of 6 Gear Dog House
Jack Jackson, of 6 Gear Dog House, is thrilled to be able to take cashless payments in his truck.
“My whole concept is around good food as fast as you can get it. Clover will be a huge help to us to keep our line moving, and to serve as many people as possible. I know Clover will be a huge help, especially since this is my first time at the festival!”
Daniel Cloutier of Molly MacPherson’s
Daniel Cloutier’s food truck, Molly MacPherson’s, does 47 events each year, but St. Patrick’s Day is by far the biggest.
“In the three days of the festival, we will serve thousands of people. It’s not uncommon for us to have a line of 45 minutes to an hour consistently throughout the day, based solely on the number of people in attendance and our truck’s popularity. It’s huge for us. I’m hoping Clover will help us to trim that time significantly, and now we’ll be able to keep better track of what we sell with Clover insights, so we’ll be better prepared for next year’s event.”
Lori Holland of Low County Lobster
Low Country Lobster’s Lori Holland makes thousands of lobster rolls for each year’s event, and is excited to be able to use Clover to make the St. Patrick’s Day frenzy easier for her customers and her staff.
“Our food is about the experience, and if I can make buying it easier, that just means more people are more likely to buy from us, which means more sales for my business!”
Chaz Ortiz of Chazito’s Latin Cuisine
Chazito’s Latin Cuisine focuses on authentic Latin fusion flavors, and has grown exponentially since starting with one food truck two years ago. While the other food truck owners at the St. Patrick’s Day festival are new to Clover, Chaz Ortiz has used it since he started his business. Initially starting as a hobby, his business then grew to one truck, followed by a second truck and finally a brick and mortar location, which he opened after last year’s festival.
“That’s how big this festival is for us. Literally, what I was able to make at last year’s event enabled me to open my restaurant, and I’ve had Clover since I opened. It’s grown with me as my business has grown. It’s so easy to use, and it’s easy for my customers. What more could I ask for?”

O’Brien knows that keeping customers happy means managing their entire experience, from the minute they walk in the door. It means keeping the shop clean and inviting, keeping up with the latest technology so that the payment process is quick and easy, and stocking the kinds of health-conscious options customers crave.
Most of all, it means speed. “In the morning, in a coffee shop, you really only have five minutes to get your coffee and get out, jump in a taxi, go to work,” O’Brien says. Cafe Grind serves anywhere from 350 to 700 people a day. And because the shop is located right next to the Jacob Javits Convention Center, the crowds get even crazier during New York’s ComicCon. “For five days, you have superhero after superhero,” O’Brien says.
When the crowds get crazy at Cafe Grind, the Clover system, and particularly the Clover Mobile, help O’Brien keep things moving smoothly. Here are four ways Clover Mobile helps keep customers happy at New York’s Cafe Grind:
It keeps the lines moving.
Cafe Grind is a small shop, and the line can get long in the mornings as the 9-to-5-ers queue up for their morning coffee. “Clover Mobile is a line-buster,” O’Brien says. When it’s busy, staff will go through the line with the Clover Mobile, taking and processing orders, so that the customer’s order is ready when they get to the counter. “They feel they’re getting taken care of faster, more efficiently,” O’Brien says.
It can go on the road. 
Cafe Grind has a substantial catering and delivery business. When staffers are out on deliveries, they can bring the Clover Mobile with them and securely process payments online. “It’s more secure for the customer because they’re swiping a credit card versus you writing the credit card number down,” O’Brien says.
It’s easy for staff to use. 
“Being in this business for 27 or 28 years, I’ve used many point-of-sale systems,” O’Brien says. “They’re all too many steps, very difficult, very hard to train the staff.” A Clover system is easy to set up—you can take a new unit out of the box and have it ready to go in less than 15 minutes—and easy to train staff to use, O’Brien says. And staff can use the Clover Mobile to clock in and clock out, snapping pictures of themselves each time.
It saves the boss’ time. 
The Clover Mobile system lets O’Brien manage business logistics on the go. With the Bills Sync app, O’Brien can scan his bills to upload them to his system and then automatically pay them from his phone. He can view analytics remotely, easily seeing how many customers have come in that day, how long it’s taken to serve each person, and what items are selling. “It takes about 5 to 10 hours a week away from what you’d be doing” in terms of managing logistics,” O’Brien says. “It lets you focus on the customers versus sitting in an office writing checks or counting inventory,” he says. With that extra time, “you can be on the floor taking care of your customers, making sure they’re OK, giving them better service.”

Time is at a premium in a business like O’Brien’s. The customer’s time is crucial—and O’Brien’s time is critical, too. O’Brien says he loves the Clover system, particularly the Clover Mobile, because it helps him stay focused on the customer. “No matter what you do, business is the same,” O’Brien says. “Be it restaurant, bar, hotel, coffee shop or clothing store, you’ve got to give the customer what they want, when they want it, in the best possible way, and at the best possible value.”

news_149,news,Negotiating conflict with employees,"Teaching your team to deal with differences constructively can make your workplace more dynamic and innovative. Here are three types of conflict in the workplace, and some communication techniques to help work through it constructively.…",20-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/negotiating-conflict-employees/,"Conflicts are an inevitable part of business, yet many managers avoid dealing with them hoping the problem will just go away on its own. This is a mistake. When not dealt with immediately, conflict can fester and become much worse. It’s better to facilitate a constructive conversation between employees and meet conflict head on. After all, conflict is not necessarily a bad thing—diversity of opinions and perspectives often reveal ways to strengthen the team and improve business. Teaching your team to deal with differences constructively can make your workplace more dynamic and innovative. Here are three types of conflict in the workplace and some communication techniques to help work through it constructively.
Owner-Employee Conflict
Emotions can run high when employees and bosses don’t agree, especially if the employee is concerned about losing their job. If this is a minor conflict, begin the conversation by reassuring the employee that you’re sure you’ll find a way to resolve the issue and that you value them as an employee. This will help reduce anxiety and focus the conversation on fixing the problem.
Review the situation as you understand it using neutral language and ask for confirmation that the facts are correct: “So if I understand it correctly the reason this keeps happening is you have trouble remembering all the steps in cleaning the bathrooms. Do I have that right?”
Let the employee clarify the situation from their perspective and then ask: “What can we do to help make sure this doesn’t happen again?” It’s important that the employee participates in coming up with the solution, but if they struggle it’s also OK to suggest a solution such as a procedure checklist, additional training, or an employee mentor. Once you agree on a solution, wrap up the meeting by asking the employee to commit to solving the issue and suggest a time to follow up together to see how the new process is working.
Employee-Employee Conflict
If the conflict occurs in front of customers, separate the employees and let them know you’ll set up a meeting to discuss it later. When you meet, share how much you appreciate their work and acknowledge that while you recently have encountered a stressful or frustrating event, overall the team works well together.
Then give each employee the opportunity to describe what happened. Make sure employees stay focused on the current event, and that they don’t start using language such as “she always” or “he never.” (If an employee has a habitual issue, that should be addressed in a one-on-one performance management meeting, not in a conflict resolution meeting.)
Once they are done, restate the problem as a process problem, not a people problem, and focus the employees on coming up with a resolution together. Here are some sample questions to focus the conversation:

Is there an adjustment we can make to our process that will prevent this from happening in the future?
How can we communicate better when things go awry so that we don’t let it escalate to this point?
If we all agree to handle it this way, do we think that will fix the problem?

End the conversation by getting the employees to commit to taking action. Ask: “Can I count on both of you to work together to make sure this doesn’t happen again?”
Once employees have agreed, let them know you will be following up with them one-on-one to make sure things have truly been resolved.
Conflict Resulting from Disengaged or Clueless Employees
Conflict with part-time or inexperienced employees often stem from misunderstandings about expectations and responsibilities. Part-time employees may have never been in the workforce before, may be completely new to your business, or may not be fully engaged in the job because it’s just something they do on the side. In these cases, it’s especially important to set expectations and job responsibilities as soon as possible to avoid tension and conflict. Ideally this is done during the onboarding period, but can be done later if employees are not meeting your expectations.
Pull the employee aside and say there are some improvements you’re hoping to make to the business and that you’re hoping they can help you. Start by talking about the values and culture you’d like to nurture. Perhaps you’d like to focus on creating an environment of respect for each other, providing exceptional customer service, or fostering a particular ambiance in your shop. Then discuss how their specific duties contribute to that experience. Clearly define the behaviors you expect from them. Make it clear how their work will be evaluated, and ask for suggestions on how to make the shop even better. When closing the meeting, ask for their commitment to making the changes you discussed. Follow up discussions like this with regular performance management meetings. (Check out this blog on tracking employee performance.)
Conflict doesn’t have to be dramatic and painful. Create a culture and work environment where employees are comfortable talking about frustrations before they become a serious conflict. Help them frame the conversation so that it is focused on making improvements for the future, not on what went wrong in the past.

news_150,news,New & notable in the Clover App Market: March 2017,Clover POS and the Clover App Market are helping small businesses operate more efficiently and improve their bottom line. Here are a few notable apps you might consider to help you get important jobs done on behalf of your business.…,21-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-apps-clover-app-market-march-2017/,"Learn about even more business apps from the Clover App Market that can expand your Clover device’s capabilities and help you get paid and sell more.
A 2014 study found that 59 percent of Americans are optimistic that future technology will make life better.
As many business owners can attest, that future is now. Clover POS and the Clover App Market are helping small businesses operate more efficiently and improve their bottom line. Here are a few notable apps you might consider to help you get important jobs done on behalf of your business.
EBT
A successful business does a standout job making each and every customer feel appreciated, regardless of socioeconomic status. The EBT app is a must-have for grocery stores, produce markets, and farmers market stands since it enables these businesses to accept electronic balance transfer (or EBT) cards—the form of payment used by those receiving SNAP, unemployment, or other governmental benefits. Card holders simply hand over their EBT card when making eligible purchases and merchants can instantly—and easily—complete the transaction.
The app is available at no cost to Clover users. It downloads quickly and integrates into any of the Clover point-of-sale systems.
Cleaning & Laundry
According to the Council of Better Business Bureaus, lost items are the number one complaint lodged against dry cleaners. Cleaning & Laundry keeps launderers and dry cleaning merchants from being buried by mountains of clothing and paperwork.
No longer do laundry businesses need to create individual paper slips for each customer or item. With a streamlined interface, the app organizes and tracks orders from drop-off to pick up. Customers’ information is digitized, enabling merchants to view and manage all active orders and past history, search by customer phone number or name, and manage pick up time.
There’s a 30-day free trial via Clover; after that, a basic subscription costs $9.99 per month. For an additional $5 monthly, merchants can upgrade their app and receive the ability to send SMS text messages to customers to inform them when their dry cleaning is ready.
BarPro with Age Verify
Laws vary from state to state, but the penalties for businesses that serve alcohol to minors can be hefty: fines of several thousand dollars and/or jail time. BarPro serves your business by confirming the age of patrons. Bartenders enter the birthdate listed on an ID, and the app’s quick verification system gives permission to drink (or not).
Those pouring drinks will love the app’s pre-loaded (and searchable) library of more than 16,000 drink recipes. Bartenders can mark recipes as “favorites,” and they’ll appear on the homepage, easing the process of entering orders. There’s also the ability to add customized instructions for making signature cocktails and to scale recipes when multiple customers order the same drink.

While there are many instances where you should work to smooth over a customer complaint, we’ve detailed a list of five things you should never say to a customer.
…",23-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-things-never-say-customer/,"Anyone who’s ever worked in customer service has heard the old maxim “the customer is always right.” And when you’ve got an angry customer reading you the riot act, it’s easy to be tempted to say and do anything in your power to make them happy.
While there are many instances where you can, and should, work to smooth over a customer complaint, we’ve detailed a list of five things you should never say to a customer, no matter how angry they are—or how valuable keeping their business might be.
“That’s not really my problem.”
There’s nothing that makes people angrier than hearing how little someone cares about their concern. Shirking responsibility for the customer’s situation, even if it has nothing to do with you, is a surefire way to create bad word-of-mouth from this customer to whomever will listen. Instead of indulging customers blaming you for everything under the sun, try to steer the conversation back to issues you are able to affect, so you’re taking a proactive stance to solve an issue rather than dodging the whole situation altogether.
“That’s against our policy.”
What the store policy consists of is of no concern to the customer in these tense moments. In addition to stopping a situation dead in its tracks, where the only resolve is an angry customer walking out, leaning on policy to fight your battle for you also makes you look like the low man on the totem pole rather than the big cheese running the show. Instead of talking about the things you can’t do, steer the conversation in the direction of the things you can. Working to resolve the situation with the tools you have available will have you looking better in the long run.
“Call me on my home number anytime.”
Though something you’re less likely to say to a heated customer, telling a demanding customer they can reach you anytime is a recipe for a disaster and is something you should never say. Offering personalized service is one thing, but work-life balance is already tricky for entrepreneurs. In the event that the customer you offer this privilege to is demanding, you will certainly regret making this offer. Before you say this, think again and just don’t.
“That employee is clueless.”
Your employees are your most valuable asset; they’re the people who take care of your business when you aren’t around. So they need to know you’ve got their back, and bad-mouthing an employee assumes the customer’s perspective tells the complete story. Your staff’s morale will rise and fall based on their perceived value to you, so try not to sell your people out in front of customers—it doesn’t send the message “you’re valued.” Even if your employee is in the wrong, it is your name on the door—which makes the you ultimately responsible for everything employees do.
“Competitor X stinks.”
There are ways to present your brand as being superior to competitors, but badmouthing them isn’t the same as highlighting your own company’s strengths. You never know who will quote your words on social media later. Plus, talking trash makes you look weak. Great brands don’t even think of mentioning the competitor, because in the mind of the customer, your brand should stand alone. Though occasionally tempting, take the high road. It’ll make your brand look stronger in the end.

news_152,news,3 amazing ways Clover businesses celebrated Employee Appreciation Day,"On Friday, March 3rd, business owners and managers celebrated Employee Appreciation Day. Here you can read the stories of how three Clover businesses honored their teams, brought to you by the good people at Homebase. …",24-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-amazing-ways-clover-businesses-celebrated-employee-appreciation-day/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. Read more employee management posts from Homebase and other Staffing & Human Resources articles here on the Clover blog.
A few weeks ago, we asked some Clover businesses how they’d be celebrating Employee Appreciation Day on March 3rd. We were blown away not just by the number of responses we received from owners planning a celebration, but also by the thoughtfulness of every response. Themes that emerged from what businesses did: giving their team members community service opportunities, and the ever-popular reward–feeding them.
Here are some of our favorites:
Gigi’s Cupcakes—Lafayette, Indiana
Emily, owner of the delightful bakery, took the opportunity to celebrate her employees while also celebrating her community.
“We bake all our products fresh each day–cupcakes, cheesecakes, cookies and more–and we bake a lot of love into them. At the end of each night I take donations out to servants within our local community, [including] police, firefighters, EMTs, social workers and teachers.
This year for Gigi’s Team Appreciation Day, Emily enlisted her entire team to help her bake and distribute an additional 500 mini cupcakes to Lafayette’s community servants as a thank you. The staff was paid for their service, same as they would be for a “normal” work day.
“Our Greater Lafayette area is full of amazing people and is an awesome community! It may not seem like this is for the team, but if you knew our team you would understand our personalities: spreading the cupcake love generates smiles, warms the heart and helps everyone feel like a bigger part of the team.”
Pigtails and Crewcuts—Greensboro, North Carolina
Children’s barbershop owner Angel planned to celebrate employees and customers alike on Employee Appreciation Day this year by engaging in a little cosplay, perfect for Pigtails and Crewcuts’ primary clientele of kids and their parents.
“We all dressed up as superheroes because my team is what makes my business super! I had their favorite lunch catered in and, because we work with children, we threw a huge superhero party for all the kids to spend time with their favorite superheroes.”
Norm’s News—Kalispell, Montana
Beth, the owner, really showed her love for her team on Employee Appreciation Day.
In her words: “I am proud of my employees—of what they learn here and how they are connecting with people. While I am their boss, I prefer to think of myself as their coworker. I employ 30-plus teenagers, and they deserved a fun night out on me!”
Beth turned their old-fashioned soda shop into a disco dance joint. Norm’s News added a disco ball and mood lighting, removed the tables for a dance floor, and brought in a catered food buffet.
“Today, technology and screens are the focus of too many teens’ lives. While appreciating all that technology has to offer, especially Homebase—as I firmly believe I would go clinically insane going back to pencil-paper schedules—I love that my teenage employees are gaining such important face-to-face skills on the job. The ‘We Are Family Silent Disco Night’ was an amazing opportunity for me to show my employees that I appreciate them and how they invest themselves in Norm’s News.”
The next Employee Appreciation Day is March 3rd, 2018, so start planning! In the meantime, how did you celebrate this year?

But there are a number of strategies any crafty small business can employ to help mitigate seasonality and make the most of what has traditionally been a slow time of year.…",28-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-boosting-offseason-sales/,"When it comes to most businesses, there’s usually a busy time of year and then a time when things slow down.
For some, the busy season comes during the holidays between Thanksgiving and Christmas. For others catering to warm weather products and activities, it’s the summer months for which businesses find themselves ramping up.
Regardless of whether your business is an ice cream shop, a ski chalet, or a seaside resort, the simple fact of the matter is that seasonality can be a real struggle to manage for many small businesses.
There are a number of strategies any crafty small business can employ to help mitigate seasonality and make the most of what has traditionally been a slow time of year. Below, we outline a few:
Diversify your product mix
The most important thing you can do if your main business doesn’t sell year round is find something that does. We can’t stress this idea enough: it’s important to diversify your product mix to ensure that your business can make it through the lean times.
For something like a swimwear shop, expanding your offerings to include light outerwear and workout gear can keep people coming through the door when the weather starts to chill. For a summer seaside resort, promoting “stormwatcher” packages during the winter months can help ensure you’re able to stay open year round.
Utilize your assets in creative ways
When thinking about how to maximize revenue during your off-season, it’s important to take stock of your assets—all of them. Your location, your shelf space, the square footage inside your storefront, your equipment-—just about everything aside from your inventory and utility bill can be repurposed in creative ways, if you can find the right partner businesses and the right angles. You just have to know where to look.
Find an un- or under-utilized lane and pounce
Just like when you opened your business the first time, one of the keys to being successful in your business’ traditional off season is finding a lane that no-one else is in and being first to market.
Perhaps you’re a books and gift shop that thrives during a more touristy winter snow season. Maybe diversifying into specialty comics and graphic novels would be a way to bring a whole new demographic through your doors.
Or maybe you’re a restaurant by a body of water that draws customers heavily during the summer months. Think about starting a food truck to bring your product to locals where they already are, year-round. Taking your gourmet savories to farmer’s markets, fairs, and construction sites could be the key to doing a brisk business during times when you’re traditionally slow. The key is knowing your market and seeing opportunity where others don’t.

Knowing when to end a promotion (and how to do it gracefully) is just as important as knowing when to run one. Here are some tips to keep your promotions working for you.…,29-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/what-to-do-when-a-promotion-is-too-successful/,"This post is part of our Marketing & Promotions for small business series. Explore more better business tips and tactics here on the Clover blog.
Promotions can help your business grow, but only if they are fully thought-through. Runaway promotions can cut into your profit margins or test your ability to keep up with demand. Knowing when to end a promotion (and how to do it gracefully) is just as important as knowing when to run one. Here are some tips to winding down promotions successfully.
Know when to stop a promotion
Promotions are exciting when they work, but keep an eye on results to determine when to pull the plug. Here are a few questions to help determine whether a promotion should be retired:
Did the promotion achieve its goals? If it isn’t achieving the results you were looking for, don’t be afraid to kill the promotion. If it’s working, but slowly petering out, it might be time to retire it and try the promotion again in a few months. (See our series on setting goals to plan out your next promotion.)
Are the results worth the efforts? If you’re selling widgets like hotcakes, but you’re not able to keep up, consider stopping the program until you figure out a better way to support it.
Are you making money or losing money? Not all promotions are designed to make money. Sometimes your goal is to increase leads in your email database or try out a new product. But all promotions take time and effort to run, so you need to determine a break-even point for every promotion. Marketers do this by estimating how much each lead is worth to them and weighing that against the time and costs of running a campaign. Take a look at average ticket prices and the likelihood of customers returning, and that will give you a good idea of how much a new customer is worth to you.
If you’ve decided a promotion is no longer working for you, it’s time to break the news to customers.
Quick recovery responses to disappointed customers
As soon as you decide to end a promotion, advertise that via social media, your website, and within your storefront using signs. Use upbeat language that focuses on how they can take advantage of future promotions. Here are some ways to break the news online:

“Whoa! Our buy-one-get-one promotion has already sold out! If you missed out, don’t worry, we’ll put you on the preview list for our next promotion. Sign up here.”
“Oh no! We’re out of stock on the items you ordered. We’ve ordered more and expect delivery on the 5th. Click here to confirm you’d like to receive it when it comes in.”
“Unfortunately the XYZ promotion has ended, but we’re planning more. Follow us on facebook to be notified when we’re running our next sale.”
“Thank you for shopping at Claire’s. This promotion has ended, but check out our current promotions here.”

If a customer is in the store and unhappy, apologize and offer a different promotion.

“I’m sorry, that promotion has ended. I can offer you 5% off our regularly priced items today since you’re a loyal customer.”
Or consider offering a freebie: “I’m sorry, we no longer have that in stock. How about a coffee on the house instead?”

If the promotion has generated a significant number of unhappy customers, consider recovering goodwill with a targeted promotion. Clover’s Promo app, for example can help you win back customers who were unhappy with an automated win-back campaign.
Tips to prevent future promotion problems
As soon as you wrap up a promotion and finish fulfilling orders, conduct a post mortem. Determine whether it was successful and worth running again, as well as whether there are things you should never do again. (Check out this post on how to learn from previous promotions.) When thinking through your promotional strategy, consider these tips to avoid being “too successful” again.

Limit the number of items a customer can buy through the promotion.
Give a specific end-date for the promotion.
Use language that gives you an out. “For a limited time only” or “While Supplies Last” aren’t just legalese—they help you gracefully back out of a promotion gone wild.

news_155,news,Six ideas for standout customer service,"Many merchants say that outstanding customer service is the goal for their staff, but truly great customer service delivers on a brand promise in a way beyond normal expectations. Here, we discuss six ideas for delivering an exceptional customer service experience.
…",30-03-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/six-ideas-standout-customer-service/,"When training staff, many merchants say that outstanding customer service is the goal—but how many are really, as they say, walking the walk?
Sure, most businesses know to do their best to treat their customers well—greet them with a smile and by name when they can, and provide a welcoming and warm atmosphere—but to deliver truly outstanding customer service takes a little more. Great customer service delivers on a brand promise in a way beyond normal expectations.
So how do you deliver “above and beyond” service? Below, we offer a few tips on how to tailor your customer experience to deliver truly outstanding customer service.
Know your customers
The first step to delivering an outstanding customer service experience is by giving them exactly what they want. To do so, it’s important to know things like who they are, what they like, when they shop, how they like to pay and beyond. To get this kind of deep insight, look to an analytics platform designed for small businesses, like Insights.
Do whatever it takes to deliver
To really stand out, it helps if customers see that you’ll do whatever they need to solve a problem. That means if they ask for something you don’t have, consider ordering it online and have it delivered to their house. Or perhaps it means driving to the next town over to pick whatever they need up. Even consider reaching out to a competitor across town. It’s stories like these, when a merchant truly goes the extra mile to deliver, that really stick out in customer’s minds and creates lasting loyalty.
Solicit honest feedback
They say that the customer service experience should be a two-way conversation. And key to fostering that conversation is providing your customers an open, honest, and most importantly, responsive feedback channel through which they can share with you. They are going to do it anyway, but on Twitter, Yelp, or Google. So why not foster the conversation in a less-public forum that says “We are listening. How can we help?” Being open to criticism and making honest efforts to correct any perceived mistake can go a long way in customer’s minds.
Reward people who say great things about you
It’s important that you’re a big supporter of the people who support you. When a new customer comes in and says they were referred to you by one of your regulars, give that regular a discount on their next visit. When somebody says something wonderful about your business on social media, surprise them with something special! It’s these kinds of moments that make your biggest supporters know that they can make a difference for you by sharing with their networks just how special you make them feel.
Reward your best customers
It’s also important to go above and beyond for the customers who are your most valuable. That includes people who spend a lot with you, and those who spend often—or even better, those who do both. To get a handle on who they are, provide them (and yourself) an easy mechanism through which you can track their purchases and reward them accordingly. To do this, look to technology like Rewards. Having a structured program in place to take care of your most valuable customers will make them feel great about spending with you while encouraging them to spend more often—a win-win for your business.
Comp customers when it makes sense
While you certainly can’t afford to be giving away freebies all of the time, you also can’t afford not to when the right opportunity presents itself. Comping a meal or a ticket when something goes wrong can mean the difference between a customer returning to try your business another day, or venting their frustration on social media. Conversely, it also makes sense to comp a meal when things are going right. Maybe your regulars are celebrating a big anniversary or a baby’s christening at your place of business—or maybe someone chose to propose in your establishment. Comping a round of champagne or a special dessert at these key moments can create the basis for a deep relationship that can last a lifetime with customers.

Read more employee management posts from Homebase and other Staffing & Human Resources articles here on the Clover blog.
The federal change to overtime may be dead, but over 20 states have new or changing overtime laws. Even the previous Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines are still getting companies into serious hot water—two Disney subsidiaries are facing $3.8 million in payments to employees for wage violations. To keep you informed, we’ve prepared a recap of the current status of overtime, future minimum wage trends, and a brief overview of the important and often overlooked details of the FLSA that got Disney into trouble with the DOL.
Federal Overtime Change Recap and its Future
Last year, companies raced to prepare for the massive change to the Overtime Law requiring all employees, whether hourly or salary, earning less than $47,476 a year to be paid overtime. Days before the law was set to take effect, a Texas District Judge issued an injunction halting the rule. Since that time, the Trump administration has issued a memo freezing federal regulations that have not yet gone into effect. Most recently, Trump’s proposed budget cuts include a 2.5 billion dollar reduction to the Department Of Labor (DOL) signaling less regulation and oversight through the DOL. It seems unlikely there will be an interest in pursuing the expansion of current overtime laws.
State Minimum Wage Increases
Nevertheless, many states continue to move forward with minimum wage increases; 19 states increased their minimum wage in December and January. A few more states have projected increases to minimum wage in July 2017. Click here for the full list.
A New Twist: Disney Princesses and the Department of Labor
Despite the consistency of policies, it is not time to rest easy. It is critical to ensure you are an expert in the FLSA and pay close attention to wage details such as procedures for paying employees for work performed outside of scheduled shifts, or wage deductions for employee expenses. Two Walt Disney subsidiaries will pay 3.8 million to employees for wage violations that included (i) deducting employees wages for uniforms that caused the wages to fall below minimum wage and (ii) failing to pay for some hours worked that some employees’ claim they were owed when working before or after scheduled shifts.
The FLSA guidelines require that no deduction be made from an employee’s wages that take the employee’s wages below minimum wage and overtime compensation for items that are considered for the convenience of the company. These Items include uniforms, tools, or even reimbursement for theft of company property.
Tip: Before ever deducting an employee’s wages, be sure to pay attention to the hourly rate equivalent that remains after those deductions hit.
Regarding payment for time worked outside of a scheduled shift, look at your company procedures and employee guidelines. The FLSA considers the wages paid to an employee for time worked to be their personal property, and a company cannot deny the payment of those wages because an employee did not follow clock-in procedures correctly or because they worked outside of a scheduled shift even if that work was without permission. An employee may be disciplined for not following procedure, but the wages earned for time worked are the employee’s property and the company cannot withhold payment. With technology stretching when and where employees are working, this question has become an increasingly difficult area for companies to protect against.

news_157,news,How to reassure your staff when business is slow,"When business is noticeably slow, employees tend to worry about their jobs. Business owners need to offer employees context and keep them focused on positive behaviors likely to improve sales. Here are 5 things managers should do to keep employees focused on the right things.
…",04-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-to-reassure-your-staff-when-business-is-slow/,"When business is noticeably slow, employees tend to worry about their jobs. Absent any insight from the boss, they begin to speculate about the future. It’s important for business owners and managers to offer employees context and keep them focused on positive behaviors likely to improve sales. Employees need to believe they can make a difference in the future of the company and their jobs. Research has shown that engaged employees are far more likely to believe they can make a difference to the bottom line, to reduce costs effectively, and to positively influence the quality of the products they create.
Here are 5 things managers should do to keep employees engaged and focused:
1. Encourage exceptional customer service.
One great way to keep your most talented staff engaged is to make them responsible for turning other employees into star employees. Consider incentivizing them to train and mentor other staff into high-performers. These employees often have subtle things they do to offer exceptional customer service without being intrusive or overbearing. It’s these little things that make for memorable customer service.
2. Educate staff on new products/services.
If there aren’t as many customers coming through the door, employees can still reach a target revenue by increasing the average ticket price of each customer. Think through which products or services bring you the most return and teach staff ways to actively promote it to people already buying from you. Fast-food restaurants have capitalized on this idea teaching their employees to sell a high-return product—soft drinks—by asking “Would you like to order the larger size for just $0.30 more?”
3. Incentivize the upsell.
Combine the previous two ideas with an incentive plan for a killer combo. Choose a product or services that is high-return for the business and have your most successful sales staff teach others how to sell it. Then motivate them with an incentive plan. This should be done carefully—some customers are sensitive to upselling techniques. Reward the server who sells the most top-shelf margaritas in a week, or the hair stylist who moves the most product.
4. Follow up with customers.
Ask employees to brainstorm a customer-outreach program. Can they take turns calling older customers (often out-of-reach for social media) and personally invite them back into the store for a promotion? Can they offer a free, personalized consultation during a typically slow time of day? Can they create and help promote a social media promotion? Perhaps they can call a customer who didn’t return to find out why—and entice them back with a special offer.
5. Encourage a team effort.
Train your staff to think like they are co-owners of your business—what would they do to improve business? What do they notice—within your storefront and in other stores—that might affect sales? Brainstorm promotions with them. How would they cut back costs? Employees often have ideas and insights owners miss because they are on the front line talking to customers.
Slower periods are often a normal part of business. Transparency, within limits, can help keep employee morale afloat during slower times. Share with them your initiatives and plans to improve things. Train your staff to take slow periods in stride and to focus on activities that can help turn things around. If the business is seasonal or has a natural cycle of ups and downs, encourage them to use the down periods as times to evaluate what they can do better and to plan for future spikes in business. What processes can they improve? What things can they do to speed up delivery and quality service during busy periods? What worked in the past and what should they try in the future? By keeping yourself and your team focused on positive activities you’ll keep the momentum moving in the right direction.

Yet most caffeine addicts hit up their favorite brewer between the hours of 7:30 and 9 a.m., after which foot traffic slows to a trickle. Here are 6 ways that coffee shop owners can perk up the afternoon lull.
…",05-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-populating-coffee-shop-m-rush/,"This post is part of our Business Problem Turnaround series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
With just about two-thirds of Americans drinking at least one cup every day, coffee is the fuel that kick-starts our mornings. Fortunately for coffee shop owners, 34 percent of those cups were bought outside the home in 2016, an increase of 4 percent from the previous year.
More and more consumers may be hitting up your cafe for their jolt of Joe—yet the vast majority of sales occur between 7:30 and 9 a.m., during which time your shop is bustling with regulars. After that, foot traffic slows to a trickle and is spotty the remainder of the day.
Here’s how to keep a steady stream of customers coming in and out of your door from open to close.
Accommodate “laptop squatters”
Encouraging people to use your shop as a coworking space is the easiest way to entice customers during non-peak hours. As we detail in our post “Business problem turnaround: A smart wifi strategy for your business,” a plethora of tables and chairs, comfy lounge seating, outlets, and fast, secure wifi turns your cafe into a workplace for independent workers, students, and those wanting to hold business meetings outside the office.
Offer private space
The majority of your accommodations should be for drop-in customers and solo workers. But as number of freelancers working from home and the number of traditional employees with flexible work environments increases, so is the demand for comfortable locations where someone can hold in-person meetings. Invest in built-ins, freestanding bookcases, decorative screens, or other room separating furniture to carve out a private area in a quiet corner or the back of your cafe. Charge a rental or reservation fee for the space and offer patrons the opportunity to order food and drink in advance so it’s ready upon their arrival.
Diversify your menu
Lattes and scones may be your top sellers, but to entice customers during off-peak hours, you’ve got to offer a wide variety of options beyond traditional breakfast fare. Busy workers will appreciate pre-packaged lunches that they can grab and go when in a hurry. (The bonus for merchants: Customers spend more when items are packaged together than if each is offered a la carte.) Others will appreciate the luxury of having a delicious, affordable lunch prepared for them.
Go the extra mile
Not only do customers want to go where everybody knows their name—they want to go where everybody knows their order. Create a subscription service that allows regulars to designate their favorites (collect the information via your website or an in-store form). Once ready, they can drop in and pick up their order in a designated area or an employee can run the packaged meal out to their car.
Offer classes
Teach members of your community what you do best: brewing the perfect cup, creating impressive cappuccino art, baking the best bread around, or perfecting a delicious quiche. These opportunities could be single classes offered occasionally, exclusive offerings available only to those booking private parties, or an ongoing series. Demonstrating your skills will cause them to appreciate your expertise even more.
Sell take-home products
What’s the next best thing to eating a tasty baked good in your cafe? Having a customer able to make it in her home. Package ingredients in kits so patrons can make their favorite products on their own. These kits will never replace your in-store product, but they’ll make your regulars feel connected and invested in your coffee shop. How could you ask for more?

Congratulations! But deciding what to pay yourself as a business owner can be tricky.
…",06-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-deciding-much-pay/,"This post is part of our “5 questions” series, helping merchants ask the right questions before making key business decisions. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
You’ve finally gotten your business to a place where it’s stable enough, maybe even profitable enough, that instead of throwing money into it to keep it running, you’re actually going to be able to take money out. Congratulations! It’s a huge step forward.
But deciding what to pay yourself as a business owner is, in many ways, even trickier than deciding what to pay your employees. With an employee, you’re going by the market rate in your area—whatever it takes to attract and retain the talent you need. But when it comes to paying yourself, you’re balancing your own income needs against the needs of your business. Here are five questions to ask when deciding how much to pay yourself:
1. How much do you need to live on?
Burnout is a serious risk for entrepreneurs, and if you’re working crazy hours and struggling to support yourself, you’re only going to burn out faster. If you want to stick with your business for the long haul, you need to pay yourself a salary that’s sustainable. Be sure to build in the ability to take modest vacations and save for retirement. Both are crucial parts of building a lifestyle that you can sustain for the years it’s going to take to achieve your goals.
2. How much can your business afford to pay you?
Of course, there’s what you need and there’s what the business can afford. Maybe your salary needs to start small, and you can plan on giving yourself a raise as you hit certain growth targets. Make sure you don’t over- or underestimate what’s possible based on one good or bad year. If you’ve been operating for several years, look at your average revenue to calculate a reasonable salary that the business can sustain through market fluctuations. If you’re a newer business, talk to other business owners in your area or a mentor from an organization like SCORE to figure out what you can expect as your local economy expands or contracts.
3. What are your long-term goals for the business?
It may be tempting to maximize your payout now that your business has the cash to throw around, but if you’re aiming for significant growth in the next couple of years, you’ll want to save some of that cash to hire more employees, buy or rent more equipment, or whatever else you’re going to need to meet your goals. On the other hand, if you’re hoping to cash out or retire soon, then you’ll want to talk to an accountant about what makes sense from a tax perspective—earning more now, or later.
4. Can you take a draw on top of your salary?
Depending on how your business is structured, you may be able to take what’s known as a draw or distribution from the profits on top of your salary. On the plus side, you don’t have to withhold payroll taxes from a draw. But a draw could also set you up for greater scrutiny from the IRS, so be sure that you don’t artificially deflate your salary to inflate that draw.
5. What’s reasonable for your industry?
If your company is structured as a corporation, and you’re an officer of that corporation, the IRS requires that you get “reasonable compensation” for your work. If they find you’re underpaid, you and your business could be in trouble. Do some research to figure out what you might earn as an employee of another company in your area so you know you’re in line with what’s “reasonable.”

news_160,news,6 tactics for unifying the front and back of house for restaurants,"To ensure a steady flow and a positive communication between the front and back of house in a busy restaurant, there are a few things that need to be agreed upon and protocols that need to be put in place.…",07-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/6-tactics-for-unifying-the-front-and-back-of-house-for-restaurants/,"There are many moving parts in a restaurant—chefs developing recipes, line cooks mastering their art, servers trying to make diners happy, and general managers trying to keep the whole operation afloat.
While their jobs might differ, everyone should be working toward the same purpose: to see the restaurant succeed, work in a positive environment, and create an experience everyone can be proud of. But sometimes ideas for how to get there can get differ among the disparate teams responsible for making a restaurant work.
Without a flow of communication and procedures in place, the front of the house where customer engagement happens, and back of house where the “product” is literally being cooked up, can be on two different pages, making the entire restaurant operation seem disconnected and unorganized. To ensure a steady flow and a positive experience, there are a few things that front and back of house need to agree on and protocols that need to be put in place.
Agreeing on the “catch”
Every restaurant serves a specific need and has it’s own unique concept. In order to ensure restaurant success, the kitchen and the dining room must be unified on the overall concept of the establishment. Once the concept is developed and agreed upon, restaurants should convey the message consistently across all channels including:

Restaurant design
Type of cuisine
Food presentation
Menu design
Elevator pitch

From point-of-sale to back-of-house
POS systems have many functions that can strengthen communication between front and back of house. However, restaurants must know what these tools are, and agree between the front and the back how they will use their POS system to communicate.
Tools such as the Kitchen Display App, which is available in the Clover App Market, allow users to send orders submitted through the Clover Register or Tables app directly to the kitchen. The app allows orders to be routed based on preparation location and/or order type. If an order is late, the app will send an indication, allowing everyone to be on the same page about orders and their status.
Getting on the same page about the menu
One of the most important points of communication between front of house and back of house is about the restaurant menu. First and foremost, servers have to be knowledgeable about the menu, and the kitchen needs to keep service staff informed. The kitchen and the dining room have to be on the same page about what the menu items are, which allergens to be aware of, and which items can be substituted.
Often times, communication snafus can occur when servers try to make substitutions or adjustments to a dish that the kitchen can not accommodate. The kitchen staff must make sure that servers know exactly which substitutions are possible and how to communicate that to the kitchen during service.
Inventory management
Managing inventory of restaurant goods often falls on the shoulders of the kitchen staff, but the front of the house must also be aware of any inventory shortages or droughts. If items are missing or in short supply, there must be a way to communicate this with the service staff.
For this reason, back of house cloud-based tools such as SimpleOrder are key. Back of house management tools give anyone with access to the system a bird’s eye view of kitchen activity, from purchasing to menu pricing to exact inventory counts. This way, the general manager has access to inventory data and can view any shortages. The more transparent inventory is across all channels, the more likely that nothing will be overlooked and staff will be alerted.
Quality control and customer service
Another aspect that the front and back of house should agree on is how dishes should be explained to guests. Restaurants also have to determine protocols on how to deal with dishes that are sent back. What is the restaurant’s policy and how are servers expected to deal with unhappy customers?
Establishing point of contact and chain of command
During a busy service, few things are worse than having ten people come into the kitchen to relay information. In the most organized and efficient restaurants, there is one person assigned to relay information between front and back of house. Often, this is the general manager or the shift manager. Having one person in the front to pass information to one person in the kitchen ensures that service won’t be hectic and whatever the issue is, it will be dealt with.

SimpleOrder is a world-leading online inventory and purchasing platform, optimizing restaurant back-of-house operations, from the purchase order to the point-of-sale, for more than 1,500 locations in 14 countries. Integrated with a Clover POS, SimpleOrder Automatic Inventory reduces inventory levels for each dish restaurants sell and streamlines stock replenishment in real-time.

news_161,news,How to maintain charm in a high-tech world,"Can a decidedly old-fashioned business maintain - or even extend - its charm by using more technology? Surprisingly, the answer is yes.…",09-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/serving-up-a-scoop-of-21st-century-customer-service-with-a-sprinkle-of-old-fashioned-charm-on-top/,"You know the type of place. A staple in your hometown that’s looked the same and served the identical, delicious plate of chili-cheese fries, Coke float, or bagel with a schmear of cream cheese your entire lifetime. The owners know all their regulars by name and welcome every new customer like it’s the first 70-degree day after a long, cold winter.
Ted & Wally’s ice cream parlor, located in Omaha, NE, is one such institution. (As their website states, “it’s an Omaha tradition.”)  Opened in 1984, current owners Joe Pittack and his sister Jeanne Ohira (both born and bred in Nebraska’s largest city) bought the business from its original proprietors 15 years ago, after scooping ice cream themselves for four years. “They wanted to keep it in the employee family,” says Joe, sharing that they received a personal loan from the former owners in order to make the purchase.
Located in Omaha’s Old Market (which houses only locally-owned, small businesses) since 2001, Pittack says that despite moving locations and adding outdoor seating, “everything is the same,” right down to the menu, tables and chairs, and countertops, which were moved from the old site. In keeping with tradition, Ted & Wally’s ice cream base is made from scratch, using a family recipe containing eggs, milk, sugar, and cream. Sticking with the “in-the-family” theme, many of its ice cream ingredients are sourced from local family-owned groceries, bakeries, orchards, and farms. The ice cream is even frozen in old-school White Mountain ice cream freezers using ice and rock salt. (Doesn’t that remind you of your childhood days?)
Key to retaining that old-fashioned magic, however, is smarter operations discreetly enabled by technology. Ted & Wally’s had been using an old push-button register to ring up all its customers — charming, but laborious. But with customers’ chocolate cones melting as they waited in line to pay, Pittack decided to upgrade his POS system to Clover. Using Clover, Ted & Wally’s gets ice cream devotees in and out efficiently. Customers no longer have to put up with a bottleneck at checkout. “Now we can run multiple credit cards at a time; before we could only do one.”
The small size of Clover devices also helps create a better experience for customers. “We’re handing cones and money across [the countertop] and we need that space,” says Pittack, explaining that a large checkout device isn’t efficient for Ted & Wally’s.
Customizable apps have also freed up time in Pittack’s busy schedule. Previously, he’d spend an entire work day processing employee timecards (workers’ shifts marked by a punch clock) and divvying up tips. Using the app Time Clock by Homebase, the job is now complete in half-an-hour, carving out valuable time that he can devote to making personal connections with customers. Other apps are enticing, too, like Clover Rewards which allows loyal customers to earn free perks they love – while giving merchants greater visibility into their best customers’ buying habits. Rewards enables all staff – not just the owner, who knows all the regulars personally – to recognize VIP customers instantly and treat them as such.
Pittack loves Homebase and the convenience it offers, and he knows that his employees will appreciate it as well, especially since it enables them to switch shifts easily. However, he struggles with getting them to sign up via email invitation. “It’s great, but you guys gotta take action,” he says with a chuckle.
Since Ted & Wally’s maintains its vintage look and product, the parlor’s customers probably won’t notice its new POS system. But they’re certain to take note of Ted & Wally’s outstanding customer service — an old-time offering that’s much appreciated by anyone receiving it.

…",17-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-clover-app-market-april-2017/,"Learn about even more business apps from the Clover App Market that can expand your Clover device’s capabilities and help you get paid and sell more.
It’s the nature of business that things are constantly changing. Clover helps entrepreneurs manage the shifting needs of their business, yet stay lean. With a thriving app marketplace, Clover allows merchants to add or replace apps as they need them. Here are some exciting new additions and updates to Clover’s offerings.
SimpleOrder
Restaurant owners spend most of their time and energy on the dining room floor or in the kitchen making sure dishes are delectable and customers are satisfied. While keeping a steady stream of happy customers coming through the door is crucial, so is making sure you have everything you need to make those dishes. Seemingly small issues, like over-ordering items or excess waste, if not monitored carefully, can dramatically affect the bottom line. With an inventory and online purchasing app such as SimpleOrder, owners can keep track of these things automatically and re-order items quickly so they never run out of key ingredients.
SimpleOrder integrates with your Clover device and calculates how much of each ingredient you’ve used as you put in orders. This tracks all elements of a good meal from chickpeas to napkins and alerts owners to low inventory before they run out of something. When building a menu or deciding specials, chefs can check real-time market fluctuations to price dishes accordingly. Even better, owners or chefs can re-order key items directly with a click of a button right in the system. SimpleOrder will also calculate how much food inventory gets wasted so owners can uncover money-draining issues before they affect revenue.
Cues
Delivering consistent, quality service can be challenging if you have high turnover, or if business is brisk and employees are doing everything they can just to keep things moving. Yet it’s the little things that customers often remember, from a hostess opening the door for them to mints delivered with the bill. Cues offers owners the opportunity to set up useful reminders that will pop up on their Clover device throughout the day.
With Cues restaurants can send automatic messages to hosts and hostesses when servers access the payment screen alerting them that a table is almost ready for the next customer. Owners can schedule reminders, like when to clean the bathrooms, when to go on break, or when to change menus from breakfast to lunch. Cues can also be used to reach business goals. Simply set up cues to remind cashiers to mention promotions, ask for feedback, or encourage customers to post reviews.
Whether creating cues for clover-based actions or timed events, this app is a great solution for improving your customer service, training new staff, or just keeping things consistent during busy periods.
Register Lite Plan for Clover
Register Lite isn’t an app…but it’s an important addition to the Clover line of goods and services. Register Lite is an affordable, cloud-based software plan available for merchants with only a single terminal for payments. It’s a simple, less expensive solution for businesses that don’t need a full Clover station, but want to take advantage of the resources that Clover offers.
Register Lite replaces an antiquated cash register with a device that allows you to track inventory, manage employees, connect with customers, and more. Merchants can customize it with apps from the Clover App Market so they can grow the business paying only for the apps they need. Like all Clover plans, Register Lite accepts all forms of payment and offers fast, secure payment processing backed by First Data. Learn more about Register Lite here.

If you’re running a business, chances are you’ve got a lot going on: customers to service, employees to manage, inventory to track—and any number of other things calling for your attention. Efficiency is a top priority. With so much happening around you, why let crowded countertops cramp your style?
This post will take a quick look at three points to consider in keeping your store’s countertops as clutter-free as possible.
First things first.
Remember the old shampoo commercial that gave birth to the adage: “You never get a second chance to make a first impression?” Believe it or not, your countertops — along with the overall cleanliness of your shop — is one of the first things customers view when they enter your store. If your counters are jammed full of point-of-sale machines, receipts, or whatever other clutter you like to keep close at hand, it looks messy and unprofessional. If you’re selling food or drinks, “messy” might also suggest unsanitary – not good for business. Keeping countertops as clean and clear as possible ensures a great first impression.
Go with the flow.
It’s your business, so your store operations should absolutely be able to work the way you want. This includes how your point-of-sale system is set up. Obviously, being customer-friendly is likely your top concern (meaning don’t have lots of wires criss-crossing the space or getting in customers’ way). 
But you should also consider how your countertop set-up looks, feels and functions for your employees. It’s worth noting that clutter constantly signals to our brains that our work is never done. De-cluttering is a state of mind, and one that you should embrace for the good of your customers, employees and business.
Pull double duty.
Think your counters are designed only for customers to put their goods onto while they check out? Then you might be missing out on a hidden opportunity. Your store counter is prime up-sell space. Think about it: your customer is already in the buying state of mind. (That’s probably why they’re standing at the counter in the first place.) It makes sense to leverage that space to push an offer, encourage repeat business with a loyalty card, or offer relevant impulse purchases. 
Now that you’ve pondered these three points, perhaps you’re realizing it’s time to ditch the wires, bulky register, receipt printer, and PIN entry device in favor of something a bit more…flexible. Like the Clover Flex, for example. It’s the full-featured device that meets all your payment and POS needs — and fits even in tight spots. With all the latest technologies embedded in a single portable device, you’ll free your hands, your mind and your countertop for the things that really matter.

news_165,news,Business accelerators: Hosting private events for VIP customers,"Regulars keep a business in business, which is why savvy entrepreneurs nurture relationships with their best customers. Make your best customers feel special: Here are 8 tips to hosting an unforgettable VIP event.
…",18-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-hosting-private-events-vip-customers/,"If you’re familiar with the 80/20 rule, you know that it’s the regulars that keep a business in business. While you may already know the critical value of knowing your best customer, here’s something you may not have considered—loyalty programs, if not done right, can feel automated and don’t differentiate your business from most other retail stores. Savvy entrepreneurs look for more personalized loyalty perks. Hosting a VIP event, for example, is an excellent way to make customer feel special, create an intimate experience that customers will remember, and get valuable insight into why they buy from you.
Here are 8 tips to make your next customer event unforgettable.
1. Give them a reason to come.
While discounts are a popular reward for loyal customers, they aren’t the only way to entice customers to come to your event. For many fashionistas, being an early adopter of a new style is desirable, so heighten the sense of exclusivity by emphasizing the ability to see and buy new styles before they hit the racks. Use events to introduce new lines, styles, colors, or seasons. Make it invitation-only and when your shop is closed to everyone else.
2. Make it fun.
Allow VIPs to bring one guest with them. The event will feel more intimate and fun if they have a friend with them, and this helps introduce your products to new potential VIPs.
3. Glam it up.
Set out some wine or champagne, and a few tasty hors d’oeuvres. Relaxed customers are good customers. Consider having a stylist suggest accessories, or a quick hair adjustment for photos.

4. Create photos opps.
Make your best customers feel like super models. Hire a professional photographer to take pictures of clients in the new items of clothing. Take a video of them walking the catwalk in your latest styles and make a video for your website. Still shots and short video clips can be used on your social media feed. Not only will this help market new looks to others on your social media pages, it’ll make your clients feel like rockstars, and heighten the sense of relationship between you and the customers. Just make sure everyone participating signs a release document.
5. Make it viral.
Customers can be shy about sashaying down a runway, so make it irresistible. Offer a free outfit to the person who gets the most “likes” on social media post-event. This is a great way to get word-of-mouth advertising organically.
6. Make it personal.
Buying is an emotional decision: People buy clothes and other products because of the way the products make them feel. Making them feel like runway models not only encourages them to try on new styles, and see how great they look in your new clothes, it’s also is also a way to highlight your stellar customer service. Offer as much one-on-one service as possible. Give them a personal stylist who will help them choose the style that works for their body type.
7. Tailor it to them.
Let’s face it—no matter how beautiful the clothes are, they likely won’t fit everybody perfectly. Bring in a tailor who can show customers that a few simply adjustments can make the styles look even better and more tailored to them. Rather than offering a discount, consider offering vouchers for tailoring services.
8. Encourage big sales.
If you’re going to discount, make it count. Now that you’ve whet their appetite with a fashion show, tempt big spenders with a special offer such as $50 off $500 or more.
Before wrapping up the event, encourage VIPs to suggest future events that would be particularly compelling or useful for them. The key to a successful event is making it fun for your loyal customers, so get feedback.

news_166,news,4 advantages to switching to a pay-at-table model,Paying the check can easily become a point of needless delay at restaurants. Take a quick look at four advantages of embracing a pay-at-table model.…,18-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/4-advantages-switching-pay-table-model/,"Click or tap to enlarge.
When you’re running a restaurant, customer service is everything. The better you can make their dining experience, the more likely they are to become a repeat customer. One of the best ways to enhance the dining experience is by improving wait staff efficiency by helping your customers wait less. 
Paying the check can easily become a point of needless delay. This post will take a quick look at four advantages of embracing a pay-at-table model.
Make customers happier.
By letting your customers pay at the table, you’ll empower them to leave when they’re done. By not having to wait on the server to complete their transaction, they’ll save time and, by proxy, enjoy a more pleasant dining experience.
Flip tables faster.
When you stop relying on outdated point-of-sale systems that tether your staff to a single spot in the back, you cut down on the number of trips they have to make back and forth through the course of a meal. The result? Diners are able to order, eat and pay faster than ever before, giving you the chance to have tables bussed and ready for seating faster than ever before. You’ll stop running your waitstaff ragged too.
Grant more peace of mind.
With the increase in credit card fraud, customers are still on edge when they hand their credit cards over to a waiter to run out-of-sight. By letting customers pay at the table, you reduce that worry immediately, especially when your portable point-of-sale solution is PCI-compliant.
Sell more stuff.
There’s an inherent freedom customers feel when paying at their table. This freedom encourages guests to order more than they normally would — drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts. Think about it: when guests know settling the check at your establishment is easy, it’s more tempting to tack something else onto your order. By encouraging guests to explore every part of your menu and removing previous barriers to entry, you’ll find the average customer spend will start to climb higher. 
It’s time to embrace the possibilities of empowering staff to accept payments table-side, right where the customers are. With a solution like Clover Flex, you can do just that. It’s the full-featured device that gives you the ability to take payment directly to the customer — whether that’s tableside, in the shopping aisle, in a salon chair, or anywhere else. With all the latest technologies embedded in a single portable device, you’ll free your hands, your mind and your staff for the things that really matter — improving the customer experience.

news_167,news,Business scenario: Dealing with new competition,"Whatever business you’re in, it’s never a pleasant surprise when a competitor opens up nearby. But before you panic, take stock of your situation and consider your options. Here are 5 steps to take when dealing with new competition.
…",19-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-dealing-new-competition/,"This post is part of our Business Scenario series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
It’s one thing to thrive as the only coffee shop on the block; it’s another thing to have to compete with the fair-trade fresh-roasted product right next door. Whatever business you’re in, it’s never a pleasant surprise when a competitor opens up nearby. It’s easy to feel threatened. It’s easy to assume that you’re now in a battle that only one of you can survive. But before you panic, take stock of your situation and consider your options. Here are 5 steps to take when dealing with new competition:
1. Remember that your competition has a right to exist.
It’s natural to feel threatened when a new player enters your local market, but it’s important to have the right frame of mind as you prepare your response. Many indie bookstores are still thriving in the age of Amazon; competition doesn’t have to be winner-take-all. Try not to begrudge them their success. Start by assuming that your new competitor is here to stay—and that’s OK. Your goal is to figure out how to thrive despite them.
2. Gather intel.
Send a secret shopper, or pay the new store a visit yourself to figure out what your rival’s value proposition is. Consider every angle. Are they targeting your customer base, or are they aiming for a slightly different demographic? Maybe they’re more of a grab-and-go lunch spot, while you’re offering a welcoming spot where people can linger over their meals. Think carefully about how much your two businesses really overlap, and recognize what they are doing well.
3. Dig into the details.
Getting a sense of the overall look and feel of the rival store is a good first step, but to prepare an effective response you’re going to need to dig deeper. Take a careful look at their products. How do your prices compare? And what are customers getting for that price? It may be that your T-shirts are pricier, but they’re also made of organic cotton or designed by up-and-coming local designers. What advantages do each of you have? How does the service compare—is their store faster but yours is friendlier? How about the location? Even if the two stores are near each other, a small distance can make a real difference when it comes to foot traffic. Is there a subway or bus stop that dumps people out at one store’s doors? Is there a popular restaurant nearby that often sends people waiting for a table to the bar right next door? Evaluate product, price, service, and location carefully. Make a list of your new competitor’s strengths and weaknesses.
4. Figure out your niche.
Now that you know what your competitor is doing well, it’s time to evaluate your own business. Consider asking a friend to stop by as a secret shopper and give you their unvarnished opinion. Talk to your staff about what they feel you’re doing well and what’s not so great—they’re dealing with customers every day. Try to figure out how you can differentiate yourself. Maybe both bookstores have a good selection, but your experienced staff is more knowledgeable, and you can look for ways to highlight those great recommendations. Maybe you’re always changing up your menu to use fresh, seasonal ingredients, or maybe your service is lightning-fast to please the customers rushing off to meetings in the office building next door. Find a way to set yourself apart.
5. Aim high.
Resist the temptation to slash your prices to get people in the door. The last thing you want to do is set off a price war that will only hurt both businesses. Research shows that it’s much harder to raise prices after setting them too low than it is to cut prices if you’ve set them too high. Psychologically, if they’ve seen they can get your coffee for $3, they’ll be reluctant to go back to paying $5 later. Customers also tend to assume that very cheap products must actually be worth less. Instead of cutting prices, try to emphasize the value you’re offering. Remember that you have more experience in this market, and more name recognition with customers, than your new competitor does. Use those advantages wisely.
When a new competitor appears on the scene, it’s easy to assume it means trouble for you. But if you carefully evaluate what they’re offering, you may find some easy ways to set yourself apart without starting a race to the bottom on price. Keep your head, do your research, and play to your strengths.

Team building activities don’t always have to cost a lot of money. You can get many of the same benefits—improved team communication, happier employees, and even better customer service—by trying some low-cost team-building activities. We asked a few businesses to share their ideas for easy and cheap team-building activities that their employees loved.
Plan a Volunteer Event
Volunteering is free, of course, but it’s still an activity that’ll build connections among your team. There are plenty of options, ranging from volunteering at a soup kitchen or food pantry to taking dogs at the local shelter out for a walk. As you’re deciding on an activity, get staff input, but put an emphasis on activities that can be performed as a group.
Host an On-Site “Olympics”
A movie theater owner we spoke to occasionally hosts staff olympics at their theater, holding competitions for popcorn bag stuffing, drink cup stacking, relay races with ingredients, and more. Of course, you’ll need to adapt this for your business and the supplies you have available, but it’s a quick and easy way to get your employees engaged. If you can, try setting up the competition in teams, so people are encouraged to work together to win.
Throw a Party for Your Team
Perhaps the easiest team building activity is to throw a party at your business for your team. If you’ve got the space for it, you could host a karaoke night or a game night—ideally something where people work together in teams, with a little friendly competition. To really mix things up and get your group interacting with other employees they may not talk to everyday, assign the teams yourself, or have a random drawing.

The good news about most of these activities is that they should be pretty easy to set up without much planning or a lot of advanced notice. Definitely ask your employees what they’d like to do, and weigh their opinions heavily—you want them to be excited about whatever activity you choose, of course.
That said, it’s important not to lose track of the purpose behind team-building activities. More than just a celebration for your team’s hard work, these activities should be designed to bring your team closer together.
What team building activities have you tried at your business in the past? What are you planning next?

news_170,news,Clover App Market Spotlight: Help people find your products online with Pointy,"Getting dwarfed online by Amazon and other e-tailers? The new Pointy app will help your products show up in online searches, whether you sell online or not. 
…",24-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/clover-app-market-spotlight-help-people-find-products-online-pointy/,"Over 90% of retail still happens offline, in brick-and-mortar stores across the country. However, these days, when a consumer is looking for something, their first port of call is to search for it online rather than visiting their local store.
This would be great news for independent retailers if they showed up in these searches, but currently Amazon and large online retailers dominate the results. Local stores are almost never found for product searches, even if someone is searching for their best-selling item 50 feet from their door.
Brick-and-mortar stores need to appear in these results if they’re to remain competitive, but getting your products online and found by Google is a difficult challenge that most retailers don’t have the time or resources to overcome.
Thanks to their new free Clover app, Pointy helps solve this problem for Clover retailers!
How Pointy’s Free Clover App Works
As soon as you install their Clover app, Pointy automatically creates an online page featuring your store’s products, complete with images and names.
Pointy helps your store to rank on page one of local search results. This directs people nearby who are doing Google searches for products that you stock to visit your store, instead of just ordering the product they’re searching for online.
There’s no need to manually enter product names and images or worry about building and optimising your website. Pointy does all the work for you.
Pointy instantly creates pages of all your store’s products that rank highly on both desktop and mobile.
Getting found online in order to sell in-store
Many retailers believe that in order to benefit from online searches they must sell online–this is simply not true. Your main strengths as a brick-and-mortar retailer are the experiences you create in-store and your proximity to customers. You need to take advantage of these strengths by leveraging your online presence in a way that gets more customers into your store.
With their new free Clover App, Pointy helps you achieve this by getting your store to the top of search results when people nearby are looking for your products online. This makes shopping in your store as convenient as buying online for customers – it’s a win-win for both parties!

Pointy gets independent retailers found online, keeping them competitive with the online giants in the digital age. For a limited time, Pointy is setting up free Pointy pages for Clover retailers. For users who sign up now, it’s free forever. If you’re interested, you can sign up in the Clover App Market.

news_171,news,Overhauling your loyalty programs: beyond freebies,"Loyalty programs can often be seen as mere giveaways, cutting into a business’ bottom line. Read on for tips on how to make sure your loyalty program is working for you. 
…",25-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/overhauling-loyalty-programs-beyond-freebies/,"When considering implementing any new marketing initiative, many business owners’ first question is “how much is this going to cost me?”
There are many ways to structure your loyalty program rewards to reduce costs, add value to your bottom line, and amplify the customer’s experience.
Exclusive access & experiences
Treating your most loyal (and probably best) customers to exclusive access and experiences can turn a reward for them into another sales opportunity for you.
For example, offer your most loyal customers access to an exclusive pre-sale event or off-menu tasting dinner where mere access to your product is the reward in itself. Coupled with the opportunity to upsell these customers and gain some intel on how these new or off-menu items might do with your general audience, this idea is a win for all involved.
Rewards-only products
To encourage higher levels of spending within your loyalty program, offer your highest tier access to a coveted product that can only be purchased with program points. Again, it’s about creating a sense of exclusivity—providing access to something they want that they can only get via participation in your loyalty program.

Gamification
Many people are motivated by competition, so creating some kind of game around your loyalty program can be an effective way to encourage participation without having to spend a lot on rewards. Create a leaderboard for your program and publicly talk up and celebrate your loyalty race leaders. This can be a great way to create buzz and a community around your program at little to no cost.
Upsells/Add-ons
Use your loyalty program to introduce customers to related products they might not otherwise have picked. For example, as a program reward, a cooking school might award a discount to be used on kitchen supplies in the school gift shop. Again, you’re providing access to more of your product, albeit at a discount, as the reward.

news_172,news,3 ways to reduce employee turnover,"Annual turnover amongst hourly employees hovers around 50%. With the high cost of turnover, it’s in your best interest to keep your employees engaged and happy. Here are a few ideas to keep your team intact.
…",26-04-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-ways-reduce-employee-turnover/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. Read more employee management posts from Homebase and other Staffing & Human Resources articles here on the Clover blog.
A recent study found that the annual turnover rate among hourly employees hovers around 49%, meaning roughly half of most restaurant and retail employees will leave their jobs within the year.
The same study found that the cost of turnover to a business is almost $5,000 per employee, so anything you can do to reduce turnover is a win-win for you and your team. We’ve got a few ideas on how you can keep your team happy and engaged in your business:
Offer some schedule flexibility
If you’re using an employee scheduling app like Homebase, you can make it a little easier for your employees to work when it fits their schedules, rather than the other way around.
They can trade shifts (with manager approval), request time off, and update their availabilities instantly, even if it’s for a one-off event. It’s a lot easier for your team than having a set schedule that repeats week after week, and it won’t add much work for your managers as they build the weekly schedule. And best of all, this won’t cost you anything.
Reward your most senior employees
Of course, promoting your best employees is a no-brainer, but there are other ways you can show your appreciation if you can’t offer a promotion right now. Start small—entrust your most valuable team members to make some business decisions on their own, even if they’re relatively minor. Also try rewarding your best team members with preferential scheduling, so they get first pick at choosing their hours for the coming week.
Encourage employee referrals
Great people know great people, and they probably want to work with them, too. Offer a referral bonus for anyone on your team that recommends potential hires (to be paid after the new employee starts). Everyone will love working with people they can trust, and having a positive work environment will likely translate into better customer service as well.

by Linda McMahon, SBA Administrator
Once upon a time….
It’s the classic opening to our favorite fairy tales. As children we dream of magic potions and knights in shining armor that will provide our happily ever after. How were we to know that our own hard work, skill and determination could be far more effective?
Once upon a time, my husband and I started our business sharing a desk. As he developed our product and expanded our markets, I managed the books. When the work became too much for the two of us to handle ourselves, we hired our first employee. As our business grew, we hired another. Then another. Over decades of hard work growing our business, that company we created now has grown to a publicly traded enterprise with more than 800 employees and consumers in 180 countries worldwide.
As an entrepreneur, I have truly lived the American Dream: the classic tale of taking a risk on an idea, working hard and creating something from nothing. Don’t get me wrong – we had plenty of stumbles and challenges that provided the plot twists along the way. But it’s a story I am always proud to tell.
And as head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, my goal now is to help more people have the opportunity to live the American Dream.
Yet many aspiring entrepreneurs have no idea how to get their stories started or write their next chapters.
The SBA is here to help, with resources both online and in communities from coast to coast.
During National Small Business Week, as we celebrate the 28 million small businesses that drive our nation’s economy, we also showcase the resources and services the SBA provides to entrepreneurs at every stage, whether they are starting up, expanding or getting through a tough time.
The SBA has 68 district offices and an extensive network of resource partners across America, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. The experienced professionals that staff these offices offer a core group of services that we call the “three Cs and a D” – capital access, counseling, contracts, and disaster assistance.
Many entrepreneurs need capital to start or expand their small business, combining what they have with other sources of financing. While the SBA doesn’t loan money directly to small business owners, it helps facilitate loans with a guaranty that a certain portion will be repaid. We offer counseling on starting, scaling and succeeding in business, from how to draft a business plan to how to export your product overseas. And we train small businesses on how to compete for government contracts, especially those set aside exclusively for small business owners. Finally, SBA provides a helping hand to small businesses recovering from disasters.
As I think back on my own story as a small business owner, I wonder how much easier things might have been if we’d been aware of the many valuable services SBA provides. My hope is that as more people learn about the SBA, they will have the confidence, skills and resources they need to succeed as small business owners, and we can continue to revitalize a spirit of entrepreneurship in our country.
There’s room for far more success stories in our library.
And the SBA can help more entrepreneurs write their own “happily ever after.”

Linda McMahon serves as the 25th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). As a member of President Trump’s cabinet, she advocates on behalf of the almost 29 million small businesses in America, which employ nearly half of all American workers and account for 56.8 million jobs.

news_174,news,The 5 people every one-person business needs on their extended team,"More than seventy percent of small business owners run their businesses all by themselves. But that doesn't necessarily mean they should, or need to, go it all alone. Here are the five people solo business proprietors should have on their team.…",02-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-people-every-one-person-business-needs-extended-team/,"More than seventy percent of small business owners run their businesses all by themselves. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they should, or need to, go it all alone. Here are the five people solo business proprietors should consider having on their team.
Accountant
As a small business owner, your goal is to make money–so it only makes sense to consult a professional to help you manage this crucial aspect of your business. Becoming a business owner naturally adds complexity to your tax scenario, so at tax time, an accountant can be crucial for making sure you’re in full compliance and are filing correctly.
This becomes even easier if you work with an accountant before April 15th rolls around. Consider consulting an accountant as you’re setting up your business, as they can advise you on everything from the systems and processes you’ll need to track day-to-day commerce, to sales taxes, to the business structure you should adopt. Their expert knowledge in all of these areas can save you a lot of headaches down the line, and help protect what your business earns.
Attorney
Sole proprietors should also consider lawyering up. In the wake of online services that make it easier for people with a do-it-yourself ethos to incorporate their business online, spending a little more money to have an attorney hear your business objectives, and consider important questions like liability and compliance that are particular to your industry, can be worth the investment. If you’re light on cash, remember that universities, small business associations, and other entities sometimes offer access to legal clinics that can get you in front of a business attorney, or a third-year law student, for free or at reduced cost.
As a business owner, you’ll also come face-to-face with matters of law throughout the course of running your business. An attorney can help you negotiate more favorable terms on your lease of commercial space, steer clear of potential legal icebergs you may not be equipped to detect in the distance, and is a good compliment to your accountant in terms of helping you decide on a businesses structure at startup time.
Marketing & PR
With all of the jobs that a solo business owner has to do, it can be easy for marketing to feel like a luxury and become an afterthought. But remember: the end goal of marketing is customer acquisition and retention. These are two of the most important activities that any business can undertake to build and protect revenue.
To be sure, it’s now easier than ever before to do marketing yourself. The two largest digital marketing platforms–Facebook and Google–both have fairly easy-to-use self-service platforms that enable you to to login, create a marketing message, and even target the people you want to reach by geography, interest and other factors. But as easy as marketing is to execute, many businesses still fail to see results for want of a sound strategy.
You might consider hiring a consultant to help you create an overarching marketing plan and program, plus a set of templates, calendars and other assets that will help you achieve your actual business objectives, and enable you to launch marketing campaigns that deliver the right message to the right people.
Public relations, which is all about getting good press coverage to drive interest in your business, can be trickier to do well without a professional. A boutique PR firm that works with individuals and small businesses might be a good bet when you’re ready for primetime. Colleges and other entities that serve small businesses can be a good place to get this type of one-time advising for free as well.
Assistant
Being a solo business requires having the proverbial hands of Hydra. That means that tasks and communications that don’t have to do directly with the day-to-day of customer relations, creating or offering your products and services, and other immediate tasks might become backed up, or even fall by the wayside.
As business starts to pick up, you might find your local paper calling your for an interview, another small business reaching out to discuss a partnership, or a potentially large customer inquiring about a bulk order or custom service. Consider hiring a person or service to prioritize and manage those types of conversations so that nothing gets by you, and you’re still free to think mostly about managing your business. A virtual assistant can be a cost-effective solution that is also just right for a small-scale enterprise in terms of the service’s commitment to your account.
Advisors
George Orwell said that, “To see what is in front of one’s nose needs a constant struggle.” Even more so when you’re doing the complex set of jobs required to run and maintain a business.
Sometimes one of the most valuable things people can offer you is an opportunity to get you outside of your own head. An advisor or advisors can give you a heads up about best and worse practices if they have experience with your particular types of businesses, offer fresh perspectives if they don’t, connect you to people and opportunities that can grow your business, and offer a “sanity check” that helps you keep everything in perspective.

news_175,news,Business Problem Turnaround: Moving perishable products before they go stale,"For many QSRs, providing an assortment of baked goods and other perishables in a glass case is almost a requirement. But what happens when it all goes stale? Inside, we share several strategies to ensure that you can make the most of your perishables case.
…",03-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-moving-perishable-products-go-stale/,"This post is part of our Business Problem Turnaround series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
For those in the QSR business—especially coffee shops—providing an assortment of baked goods and other perishables in a glass case up front is almost a requirement. Patrons have come to expect to be able to buy something sweet to nosh with their hot (or cold) drink.
While all food-based businesses have to deal with some spoilage, for those whose food products become less desirable after a single day (like bakeries or cafes), it’s important to employ creative strategies to ensure as much product as possible sells before it goes ‘bad.’
Set the scene
Having the right layout in your business can be the difference between selling out each day and selling nothing at all. In the grocery business, it’s popular to say “eye level is buy level,” and the same rings true for QSR businesses that deal in perishable goods. It’s crucial that if you expect to do a brisk business with perishables, you don’t overlook elevating—both figuratively and literally—the visibility of the product.
Also, it’s important to provide samples to introduce customers to products—both new offerings and old favorites. Remember, every customer might not know about your shop’s famous sticky buns, so be sure to sample them often. In addition to improving the customer experience (and avoiding the occasional ‘hangry’ outburst), having a little bite to offer at checkout can also educate your regulars about new products you’re introducing or entice them into an impulse buy of an old favorite.
Finally, science shows that scents can stir up powerful emotions and influence behavior. Anyone who’s caught a whiff of french fries outside a diner can attest. To ensure their mouths are watering by the time they reach the front of the line, try to have items that smell great in the stove to give your business a little olfactory boost.
Launch smart promotions
If you’re planning to move a whole day’s worth (or more) of perishable goods daily at your business, it’ll be important to come up with some smart promotions to do so.
While technology, like Promos, and social media can help get the word out, it’s important to craft promotions specific to the products you hope to move.
For example, try running a happy hour special specifically for perishable items, discounting them towards the end of the day to help them move. You might offer discounts for bulk pre-orders. Or, to improve business during off-times of the day, consider doing a two-for-one deal to bring in more customers during traditionally slower hours.
Make the most of the situation
Regardless of how well you design your store, and how great your promos are, some days you’re just going to have some leftovers. There’s no getting around it.
On the days you do have some leftover goods, have you considered up-cycling it into something else? For example, if you make bread, can you take the day-olds and turn them into gourmet bread crumbs or bread pudding?
Another option is giving the older products away and leveraging the occasion for goodwill. Partner with a food bank or shelter to donate leftover food, and support those you need in your surrounding community. Everybody wins.

news_176,news,5 questions to ask before launching a marketing program,Coming up with new ways to attract clients is fun. Yet promotions require careful planning to make sure they don’t unintentionally eat into profits. Here are five questions to get your next marketing idea ready for prime time. …,04-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-launching-marketing-program/,"This post is part of our “5 questions” series, helping merchants ask the right questions before making key business decisions. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and explore for more better business tips and tactics.
Brainstorming marketing programs and promotions can be really exciting and fun! After all, a successful promotion can really give business a boost. Before diving into a project, though, you need to ensure it makes business sense to pursue. Promotions require careful planning to make sure they don’t eat into profits or harm business in unintended ways. Here are five questions to get your next marketing idea ready for prime time.
1. What business goal do you hope to achieve with this program?
Increasing sales and revenue is not the only marketing goal. Marketing campaigns can be designed to increase traffic to a website, increase the number of leads in an email database, establish a reputation as an authority, build a social media following, strengthen relationships with high-return customers, test new products or price points, and more. Whatever the goal is, make sure you have one and that it fits with your overall strategy for growing the business. Understanding the goal is crucial for planning and evaluating a promotion.
2. How will you measure the results of this campaign?
Increasing your reputation in an industry is a great goal, but it’s not a SMART goal unless you determine how to measure it. (Learn more about SMART goals in the Be It Resolved series.) If the goal isn’t measurable, it will be difficult to determine whether the campaign was successful. Establish some key performance indicators such as revenue targets, number of leads with full contact information, or number of return customers within a specific time period.
3. What’s your break-even point?
How much to do you need to sell to make back your investment in the promotion? The simplest measure is to add up all the promotional costs, then divide that by the profit you make on each sale. Reaching the break-even point should be one of your performance metrics when determining whether the campaign is successful. In addition to knowing the break-even point, consider whether there is any opportunity cost. For example, if there is one season where you make the bulk of your sales—back-to-school, prom season, Christmas, or summer—and you only have the bandwidth to do one promotion, you need to weigh the risks of one campaign over another. Campaigns can be very time consuming, especially if it’s the first time you’re running it. You might not be able to run your tried and true campaigns if you’re spending that energy and resources on a new campaign.
4. How will you spread the word?
Even the best promotion won’t work if no one knows about it. Spend some time thinking about how to get the word out to customers. Use all the free options available to you: post on social media, email your list of past customers, put up signage, and start advertising before the promotion starts to customers coming in the store. Many stores will start advertising a promotion with a small coupon or flyer they hand to customers with their receipt. There are also options that cost money such as ads online or in newspapers. When evaluating different marketing options, consider who your target demographic is and what is the best way to reach those customers. Ideally your promotion attracts customers more likely to buy big-ticket items or to return when the promotion is over. Check out 8 Steps to Better Target Marketing for more on defining and attracting the right customers.
5. What promotion rules will you set?
Sometimes business owners are so focused on trying to make a promotion successful, they forget to limit it. Yes, it is possible for a promotion to be too popular. Promotion rules are put in place to protect the business from bad customer experiences (such as running out of stock), from losing money, or from being overtaxed by the promotion. Promotion rules should also be closely tied to your goals. If the goal, for example, is to get rid of stock on an item, it doesn’t make sense to limit the promotion one to a customer. If the goal is to bring in as many new customers as possible it completely makes sense to only allow one per customer. To avoid unrealistic expectations, you probably should always limit it to “while supplies last.” It’s better to honor or extend a promotion unexpectedly for customers willing to wait for the next shipment than to have to explain why you ran out of stock. Also, be careful to think through all other promotions—will you allow them to use two coupons on the same item? Perhaps you allow bending the rules if a customer signs up for your loyalty program or your email list. Remember, all restrictions need to be clearly communicated to the customer.
These five questions will help you consider whether a promotion is worthwhile and strategically makes sense.

news_177,news,3 ways to save time while scheduling your staff,"Scheduling is one of the most time-consuming tasks for any manager, often taking upwards of four hours per week. But it doesn’t have to! With employee scheduling apps, you can publish a schedule in just fifteen minutes. 
…",08-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-ways-save-time-scheduling-staff/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. Read more employee management posts from Homebase and other Staffing & Human Resources articles here on the Clover blog.
Scheduling is one of the most time-consuming tasks for any manager, often taking upwards of four hours per week. But it doesn’t have to! With employee scheduling apps, you can publish a schedule in just fifteen minutes. After you ditch the paper schedules or spreadsheet templates, you’ll save hours. Best of all, your employees will love the new schedules too!
1. Switch to a scheduling app
Using an employee scheduling app like Homebase will save you hours almost immediately. When you’re building the schedule, you’ll have all the information you need in one place: employee availabilities, labor costs, sales estimates, weather forecasts, and more. No matter what your business goal is, you can be sure you’ve got the right level of staffing for every shift.
2. Allow your employees to swap shifts
Take some of the scheduling burden off your manager’s shoulders by setting up a policy for team members to find coverage as needed. With a scheduling app like Homebase, your team can swap shifts on the free mobile app, and your manager will get a notification to approve the swap, so there aren’t any surprises. But by liberally allowing your team to trade shifts and find coverage amongst themselves, you can worry a little less when building your schedule, since you know your team can find coverage as necessary.
Some businesses actually end up publishing multiple weeks of schedules at once, knowing that if something comes up for a member of their team, it’s easy to request time off.
3. Have clear guidelines on availabilities and time-off requests
We’ve spoken to lots of business owners still using paper schedules and they’ve all described a similar scene when building their schedule: a cluttered desk filled with sticky notes and slips of paper with requests for time off.
It doesn’t have to be this way! Using a scheduling app like Homebase, you can set some preferences for how your team requests time off or adjusts availability. You can, for example, require a minimum number of days advanced notice for time off. Or request that your team update their availabilities for a few weeks in the future. Both of which your employees can do right from their mobile phones, so no one has to deal with scraps of paper anymore.

news_178,news,Enterprise behavior: Streamlining order delivery,"Restaurants that don’t have systems in place to deliver food to customers quickly and correctly are missing an opportunity for a serious boost to their bottom line.
…",10-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-streamlining-order-delivery/,"Learn more about the processes, initiatives and habits of enterprise businesses, and how you can adapt those processes to help your small or medium business run better.
Dining out has always been a special treat. But with today’s schedules being busier than ever, it’s become more of a hassle. Some would rather forego the reservation route in favor of having their favorite restaurant’s food delivered. Restaurants that don’t have systems in place to deliver food to customers quickly and correctly will surely find themselves missing out on a large piece of the financial pie.
Don’t believe it? There’s strong evidence that having reliable delivery practices means the difference between a restaurant that thrives and one that folds. Current delivery in the US market accounts for about $11 billion annually, but Morgan Stanley projects that with the ease of mobile and online ordering, that number may surge to $210 billion over the long term. We’re guessing we have your attention now. Keep reading to find a few suggestions that can help your restaurant capitalize on this emerging trend.
First, we recommend connecting with one or more of these delivery systems that can help drive orders. We’re talking UberEats, GrubHub, Seamless, and the like. They’re reputable, well established, and always eager to partner with new restaurants.
Next, explore some of these top-performing delivery apps from the Clover App Market and see how they can help you streamline your order delivery process.
Order Timer shows the front and back of the house how much time is left for them to make an order. This app will keep the kitchen on their toes to make sure they get the food out in a timely fashion.
SimpleOrder is a world-leading online inventory and purchasing platform, optimizing restaurant back-of-house operations, from the purchase order to the point of sale for more than 1,500 locations in 14 countries. Integrated with a Clover POS, SimpleOrder Automatic Inventory reduces your inventory levels for each dish you sell and streamlines stock replenishment in real-time.
Clavo OrderPad is the fastest way to handle restaurants’ orders while increasing staff efficiency and delivering exceptional customer service. OrderPad enables servers to take orders directly from the table and send them to kitchen, split bills, manage orders, take payment and more.
iMenu360 Online Ordering provides a fully integrated online and mobile ordering solution for your restaurant’s website. The iMenu360 solution is fully branded to match the look and feel of a restaurant’s website and provides a user interface that is easy to navigate for customers.
Finally, consider some available apps that help you take into account the logistics of delivery and communication with customers.
Delivery Fee allows you to create a pop-up for every order which adds a preset delivery fee. You can adjust the amount of the fee based on distance, or the total value of the order.
Driver Assign will give you better tracking of your delivery orders by assigning a specific driver to an order. You’ll be able to run instant reports to see which drivers took an order and if they are holding any cash sales.
No matter what your house special is, consider putting order delivery on the menu.

Many small business owners think they can’t control what shows up when customers search for their business. With some tweaks and the help of free online tools, they can. Here are some tools and suggestions to refine your online strategy:
1. Audit Your Site
One of the first steps in improving your online presence is to determine keywords you think customers will use when searching for your business or products. Then you need to optimize your site to show up when people search for those terms. That’s where free tools like WebsiteScore comes into play. It reveals key information such as current Title Tags and how keywords are used on the site. Title tags are important because they are the text that appears in bold in Google’s search results. Armed with their 10+ page report, you can work with your developer to optimize your site and help it show up in Google searches for desired keywords. Another tool worth checking out is SEO Book. Once you sign up for a free account they offer a number of tools including keyword search tools to help figure out what keywords to use.
2. Monitor Social Media
I teach new entrepreneurs at NYC Small Business Services, and one of the most common mistakes I hear small businesses make is that they think they need to be on every social media platform out there. There are hundreds of options and it’s unreasonable to think you can run your business and manage multiple social media platforms successfully. Instead, identify the platform(s) that your customers are most likely to use and focus on those. Consider using free social media measuring tools such as Howsociable.com or SocialMention.com. Use these tools to search for your business or products in social media. Also search for competitor brands to see which social media platforms are the most active for them. This is a good indicator of where your customers are most active.
If you’re in the business of selling retirement services, you probably don’t want start a SnapChat account because most of the users are millennials and that’s clearly not your priority demographic. Another quick and easy way to see what platforms your target customers use is to ask them. You can do this informally as people come in, or you can poll them via email. If you’re just getting started and don’t have a customer base to survey, check out Pew Research’s Social Media Fact Sheet which includes a handy chart showing a demographic breakdown of the top social media platforms.
3. Check Out Competitors
New website designs and software popping up every day. You don’t need to offer every new gizmo on your site, but it is a good idea to periodically check out what other successful businesses in your industry are doing. Clover Insights, a free app on Clover’s App Marketplace, makes this analysis easy. By searching for similar businesses in your area and nearby cities, you can learn which ones bring in the most revenue based on real data. Or, find other business types that sell to the same customer base. Spend some time on their sites to see how they market to this demographic and whether there are ideas you should incorporate into your site.

While many businesses are attracted to the slick design of Clover’s handheld and countertop models, its true power lies in its ability to be flexible to any business, regardless of its needs.
Clover’s App Market offers a wide variety of apps, expanding its functionality beyond the traditional point-of-sale system to create a custom business center capable of any number of tasks and handling all of a small business’s day-to-day needs.
Below, we profile several of the powerful apps recently made available or updated in the Clover App Market.
Customer Relationship Management
Knowing who your customers are, where they’re from, what they like, and how they buy are key to reaching them on their terms.
That kind of information used to be restricted to large, complicated, enterprise-level software systems. Now, apps like Clover’s Customer Relationship Management (by BuyFi) bring that kind of intelligence and data to small businesses.
With the CRM app, small business merchants can segment customers by buying behavior—enabling proprietors and their staff to see who their regulars are, and how best to reach out to them via marketing efforts
Couple that with the ability to add customers to a cloud-based database right from the point of sale—growing your customer contact list—and send targeted emails to any selected segment. Customer Relationship Management brings the power of those expensive, often-complicated enterprise systems to any small business in an efficient and easy-to-use package.
Tap Mango
Many SMB-focused loyalty apps offer an expected functionality set—the ability to track customers purchase history, set reward conditions, distribute awards. Tap Mango stands out from the rest with its ability for businesses to create a customized loyalty program run from the Clover terminal.
Create branded keychain tags for your customers (putting a daily reminder of your business into their pocket) that allows them to check-in to your business, collect points for purchases, and redeem rewards, all within an app that maps to your business’s unique identity.
In addition, you’re able to run analytics on customer data, create customized deals targeting your unique customers, and develop marketing campaigns using the help of any number of Clover’s powerful, integrated marketing applications. And you can do it all from the Tap Mango portal on your Clover device.
SimpliBoard
For many creators, engineers, and project developers of all kinds, the Kanban board is an essential tool for collecting ideas and tasks, and managing their development in a simple, visual format.
SimpliBoard by Infuse for Clover brings the power of the Kanban method to any small business, enabling leaders to track projects, goals, and to-dos in a clean, efficient visual interface.
For the many businesses short on space for a traditional whiteboard or poster and sticky notes, SimpliBoard brings the simplicity and elegance of visual task tracking to the Clover terminal.

While the number of tasks a business owner has to handle in a day are many, these apps (and others in the Clover App Market) streamline the process, bringing all of your business’s needs into a singular interface—your Clover point of sale.

You should see it as a badge of honor — as long as you have the tools to keep the line moving along. Here's how to turn a long wait-time into a shorter one for an improved customer experience.…,15-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-reasons-embrace-line-busting/,"Click or tap to enlarge.
Some people see a huge line inside (or coming out of) a store as a problem. Not us. We see it as a badge of honor — and a sign that a business must be doing something right. After all, people won’t waste their time standing around in lines for products or services that are subpar. So even though long lines are a good problem to have, merchants still need to figure out the best way to keep that line moving. Some merchants address this by employing “line-busting”: turning a long wait-time into a shorter one for an improved customer experience.
Here’s why your goal should be to turn those long lines into happy customers as quickly as you can.
Time is of the essence.
No matter what business type, all customers’ value their time above all else. Studies show that a seven-second reduction in customer wait times increases a chain’s market share by as much as 1 percent. Think about what a one percent bump could mean to your long-term success. A fast, efficient check-out process promotes customer happiness, encourages repeat business, and directly improves the bottom line.
Encourage customer interaction.
Most merchants don’t hire staff to be silent or work in a vacuum. On the contrary, among other reasons, you probably hired them for their good personalities. Freeing employees from being behind the counter empowers them to engage with customers in line as they take their orders. This builds a natural rapport, improves customer service and satisfaction, and solidifies your spot as a preferred business customers will return to.
Sell more product in the same amount of time.
One of the biggest benefits of moving customers through the line more quickly is the ability to serve more people in the same amount of time. Another benefit is having customers wanting to order more because they know their wait isn’t going to be as long. Yet another benefit: customers are less likely to bail entirely because they’re standing with a long line that shows no signs of moving. Either way, line-busting boosts sales with minimal effort.
Hopefully you’re convinced it’s time to make line-busting a priority. But how? Step one should be upgrading your current point of sale system to enable staff to move beyond the counter, taking orders from customers while they wait in line. Our latest product, Clover Flex, is a full-featured device that meets all your payment and POS needs. With all the latest technologies embedded in a single portable device, you’ll free your hands, your mind and your countertop for the things that really matter — better servicing your customers.

Here are five tactics to help employers get to the root of their retention problems—and fix them.…",17-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-dealing-high-employee-turnover/,"This post is part of our Business Scenario series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
Do employees leave at dizzying rates? Is turnover straining the business?
With nearly half of hourly employees resigning each year and replacement costs exceeding $5,000 each, the impact can be painful. Service industry employers report that maintaining a stable, high-quality staff is one of their biggest challenges.
While some employee turnover is inevitable, business owners can slow the revolving door by rooting out underlying issues that contribute to the flow. Fixing problems—and scaling up practices that keep people in place—can help improve service, reduce expenses and headaches, and free up time.
Here are a few ideas for boosting retention:
Spot trends in turnover rates.
High turnover is the norm in many restaurants and shops, particularly when they rely on part-time and seasonal workers. But is turnover actually increasing?
Changes in patterns can signal that there’s a problem: onerous scheduling policies, less-than-competitive pay, toxic coworkers, suboptimal working conditions, lack of career paths, or even conflicts with the boss.
Ignoring the problem will only make it worse. One way to uncover hidden issues is to sit down with employees before they depart and find out what’s happening.
Gather honest feedback with exit interviews.
Exit interviews are often used by large companies to diagnose problems. But in small businesses, where everyone knows each other, people are often reluctant to hurt feelings or jeopardize future recommendations.
But conducting interviews doesn’t have to be uncomfortable. Interviewers should aim to break past this natural guardedness and draw out candid information about what’s working, what’s not, and what changes will improve the work environment.
The online career site Monster.com suggests starting the interview with a subtle variation on the “why are you leaving” question. Instead, ask employees what triggered them to start looking for another job. Follow up face-to-face interviews with a short survey (online, email, or paper), which can prompt people to share even more.
Check out these sample exit interview questions that will get employees talking freely.
Hire people who are more likely to stay.
Hourly employees have a powerful impact on businesses, just like salaried workers. They make the difference between an exceptional customer experience and a so-so one. That’s why it is important to get reliable people on board for the long haul.
How did you find the most successful employees? Did you use an online recruiting tool, a sign in your establishment, word of mouth, or maybe a Facebook notice to followers? Try to figure out which strategy brought the best results.
Keep digging for clues about what works. For instance, if college students make up a portion of the workforce, who tends to leave and who stays? More mature upperclassmen can seem preferable to freshman, but older students also have one foot out the door. Freshman, on the other hand, may be more willing to devote years to a part-time job—serious longevity in the retail or restaurant space.
Create a great working environment.
Nothing attracts and keeps employees like a positive workplace. Millennials, in particular—who make up one in three workers and flood the ranks of hourly, part-time staff—enjoy having control over their schedules, receiving meaningful training opportunities, and feeling like valuable contributors on a team.
Learn how an adventure-tourism business in Colorado keeps its young staff of seasonal workers coming back summer after summer by offering management opportunities, paying for training, tapping their expertise, and giving them new duties to master.
Offer pathways to advancement.
As the economy slowly improves, workers are less resigned to stay in dead-end jobs and more apt to seek out better options, including at larger companies. According to Gallup, 51% of workers are actively looking for a new job. In another survey, the main cause driving them away was lack of advancement.
To combat the challenge of high turnover, nearly 40% of small business owners are investing in training and employee development. Like the Colorado adventure company, they’re grooming employees for new positions, giving them new assignments that expand their expertise, sending them for outside training, and finding ways to make sure people feel valued and rewarded.
The path to loyalty can follow many routes. But opportunities to grow and advance are the single most important thing a business owner can give their employees, even part-time hourly staff.

news_185,news,How to effectively share your brand message with customers,"Once you have a solid concept for a restaurant, how do you go about sharing it with potential patrons and your community? Here are some tips and tools for developing your brand and getting your message out there.…",23-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/sharing-your-message/,"This is a guest post by the team at SimpleOrder.
In our last post we discussed unifying the front and back of house to ensure smooth and easy service at your restaurant. One of the key takeaways from the post is the importance of unifying your concept so that your restaurant can tell a centralized story and market their brand.
However, once you have a solid concept, how do you go about sharing it with potential patrons and your community? Here we have some tips and tools for developing your brand and getting your message out there.
What is your story?
Your story is your why, it is your ethos, and it’s the reason behind creating your establishment. When we surveyed a group of restaurant owners about what they think is the single most important thing to starting and running a restaurant, they unanimously agreed that having a strong concept is essential. Your concept can be anything from natural wines to plant-based foods, but your concept has to be present and affirmed.
Once you have your concept in mind, you can begin marketing to valuable customers and rewarding your regulars.
Leverage your Community
Depending on what your concept is, there is likely a community of people and businesses that share your ethos and passion. For this reason, it’s best to leverage your community and build strong networks to get more exposure and spread your message.
For example, if your concept is a natural wine bar, you will probably meet with several natural wine producers and retailers. You can photograph the wineries during your visits, share their stories, and highlight different wines through your establishment’s blog and social media channels. Working with your community to build your story will benefit your marketing tremendously.
Sign-up for Google Alerts
Another wonderful way to share your message and expand your reach, is through sharing relevant articles and updates about your industry. One wonderful and very easy way to do so is by signing up for Google alerts through your Gmail account. You can do so by going to your settings and typing in keywords. Once you do so, you will receive news in your email feed daily with any relevant articles in your topic of interest. Any articles that are of interest to you will be ideal to share through your social media pages. This will keep your audience engaged and interested.
Join Facebook Groups
Another great way to expand your reach and engage your community is through joining facebook groups that hold the same ethos as your restaurant. Once a member of these groups, you can post any relevant updates, deals, specials, or content.
Stay Aligned
The best marketing practice you can have for long term success is keeping clear and aligned through all your different streams. If you are preaching a healthy and positive lifestyle, your restaurant should convey this essence. People feel duped when a message and image is presented through marketing strategies, but doesn’t reflect reality. Restaurants that succeed believe in their message, stick to their word, and provide the same experience in the flesh.
Utilize Tools
There are several tools and applications available to help your business streamline their marketing tactics, unify the message and track progress. BeSocial, available in the Clover App Market makes it easy to share updates, post special and measure engagement. Rocket Responder allows users to manage individual and group emails and MixWallet helps you send digital promotions to your potential and current diners.

news_186,news,4 tips to reduce your labor costs,"Aside from inventory costs, labor costs are usually one of the largest expenses for a business. But don’t worry—there are a few ways you can keep your labor costs under control, especially if you’re using modern team management software like Homebase.…",24-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/4-tips-reduce-labor-costs/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. Read more employee management posts from Homebase and other Staffing & Human Resources articles here on the Clover blog.
Aside from inventory costs, labor costs are usually one of the largest expenses for a business. This is especially true if you’re a brick and mortar location that needs to staff people throughout the day, even during the slow periods. Add local regulations on top of that, like New York’s Spread of Hours rules, and managing labor costs can become a real headache.
But don’t worry—there are a few ways you can keep your labor costs under control, especially if you’re using modern team management software like Homebase. Here are a few ways:
1. Use prior sales data to help you determine when to staff
Look at sales data when you’re scheduling so you can be sure you aren’t overspending on labor during your slow periods. When you connect your point of sale system, like Clover, to your scheduling software, like Homebase, you’ll get all the data you need in one place. Looking at the last few weeks of data, you’ll get estimates of sales for a given shift, so you can keep your labor cost percentage in check.
2. Pay attention to the weather
This is especially important if you’re a business that relies heavily on foot traffic, or if you have a large outdoor seating area. Inclement weather can dramatically change your business. When you’re scheduling with Homebase, you’ll see the weather forecast right alongside your estimated sales and wages, so you can minimize your surprises. If there’s a cold front coming through, you’ll probably want to schedule fewer staff at your ice cream shop, or if it’s raining, you may need fewer team members at your store that day.
3. Track overtime closely
This is a no-brainer, but it’s always worth repeating. Using software like Homebase can make it really easy to track hours worked, even for the same employee across multiple locations. As you’re scheduling your team, you’ll see warnings for employees that are scheduled for more than forty hours (or the maximum number of hours you’ve set), and as the week unfolds, you can also get text message warnings as employees are about to hit overtime.
4. Limit early clock-ins
You might’ve seen this referred to as “time theft” before, but oftentimes it’s just an employee clocking in a few minutes early. Over time, though, this can add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars every month. With a time clock app like Homebase, you can prevent early clock-ins entirely, because your employees won’t be able to clock in until their scheduled shift starts. And at the end of the shift, we’ll also let them and you know if they forgot to clock out, so you can limit your overtime exposure.
Here’s the good news! Most of these labor cost controls are pretty straightforward, and they’re simple to implement when you use software like Homebase for scheduling and time tracking. Once you make the switch, you’ll start seeing the savings almost immediately.

Carol is People Operations Director at Homebase. With free online tools and mobile apps for managers and employees, Homebase eliminates the paperwork and headaches of scheduling, payroll, and team communication for local business.
At Homebase, Carol focuses on providing thought leadership, tips and tricks, and scalable HR solutions for the 50,000 businesses that Homebase serves.

If you’re a service provider, you already know how much you charge per hour—if you’re running a retail business, think about how much you pay your managers and then come up with a ballpark figure that adds extra for your expertise. Figure out how much you’re spending to do your accounting yourself, and compare it to quotes from some local pros. You may be surprised at how affordable outsourcing really is.
2. How high are the stakes?
An accountant doesn’t just take busy work off your plate. A good one should be able to make your tax returns bullet-proof. Some will even have audit insurance, so they’ll have your back—at no extra charge—if the IRS takes a closer look at your books. Accountants can also help make your loan applications more appealing and advise you on big business decisions like buying or selling a franchise, reallocating shares when partners join or leave, or selling your business when you’re ready to move on.
3. What do you need your accountant to do?
Keep in mind that an accountant can do more than just balance your books and prepare your taxes. They can dig into the data on your business and give you an invaluable outside perspective. An accountant can alert you to product lines that aren’t working, let you know that a new location is struggling to find its feet, or show you opportunities for growth you might have missed. It’s fine to hire just a part-time bookkeeper if that’s all you need or can afford, but it’s worth finding out how much a little more help would cost.
4. Should you hire an outside firm or delegate to an employee?
Get some quotes from local firms and take some time to think about what kind of arrangement will be best for you. If you’re a low-volume, high-ticket business, your bookkeeping might be simple enough to delegate to a current employee. If your needs are more complex, you might be looking at hiring someone new to keep track of things—in which case, it’s worth crunching the numbers to see whether you should hire a part-time or full-time employee, or contract with an outside firm.
5. Does this person understand my business?
Whatever kind of arrangement you’re looking at, you want someone who really understands how your business works and what your biggest challenges and opportunities are. Tax law is complicated, even for professionals, and you want to feel confident that your accountant knows how to get you all the deductions you’re entitled to. Get some recommendations from similar businesses, so you know the person you’re working with has experience dealing with the issues you’re likely to face.
Hiring an accountant can be a great way to professionalize your business and help you prepare for growth. A good one can not only take some tedious tasks off your plate, but can serve as a great advisor.

news_188,news,Business accelerators: 4 ways to co-market with another business,"Done right, co-marketing can help you get new customers, build customer loyalty, and increase the bottom line. Here are four approaches to co-marketing with tips on how to get the most out of it.…",31-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-4-ways-co-market-another-business/,"Co-marketing with another business is one way to open new opportunities and differentiate your small business from the competition. Done right, co-marketing can help you get new customers, build customer loyalty, and increase the bottom line. Here are four approaches to co-marketing with tips on how to get the most out of it.
Close a gap in your offerings
Often what sets local businesses apart are the small differences in customer experience. These days if you really want to get a good cup of coffee you have many choices. Cafes that offer a unique experience, either by their atmosphere, comfy chairs, or artisan bakery items, stand out and have a competitive edge. Compare your business to the competition and see if there’s a hole in your offerings, or better yet, a hole in the marketplace. Is there nowhere to hold small business events or to hang out with coworkers after work? Perhaps a room in the back can be repurposed to offer private parties or a happy hour with live music. If that’s the case, partnering with musicians and other artists might make sense. Consider partnering with a small catering business to offer more than simple accoutrements if a local office wants to have a small party. Be creative—these small differences are what makes your store unique, local, and memorable.
Add value to your customers
Is there a natural add-on to your product or services—something that would make it even more of a value for customers? If so, see if there is a business you can partner with to provide it. Jewelry shops, for example, cater to customers who are looking for a special gift. Make that gift even more special by partnering with local artists who create unique wrapping paper and gift cards. Customers can get everything they need for a truly special gift in one stop.
Expand your customer base
One exciting way to find new customers is to partner with complementary businesses. Referral arrangements are mutually beneficial because they are not competitive, but attract similar target customers. Consider what type of businesses might be talking to your target customers and how you might help one another. Whether it’s a simple word-of-mouth referral, handing out brochures and business cards, or allowing signage in your shop, a referral partnership can help spread the word about your services or products. Salons could partner with a fashion stylist to help offer “makeover” packages. A yoga studio could partner with physical therapists or massage therapists. Lawyers and accountants who specialize in the same area, such as small businesses, can offer packages together or refer business as the situation merits.
Reduce the cost of doing business
Some costs of business are fixed, such as rent. But partnering with other businesses to rent out space can help reduce those fixed costs and lower the risks of opening a new location. This type of partnership works well if there is something special about your location or if your business is seasonal. For example, a surf store on the beach could sell tickets to jet-skiing, parasailing, or other water sports. Businesses in tourist areas could sell tickets for local tour guides. Alternately, seasonal stores could flip their model and partner with a business that provides off-season help. A summer-based business could, for example, rent space to a local accountant during tax season.
Whatever your reasons for partnering, make sure your co-marketing arrangement:
· Doesn’t confuse customers
· Complements and enhances your business
· Is mutually beneficial for both businesses

news_189,news,7 benefits of accepting checks,"Checks are still a popular way to pay for purchases, with more than 17 billion check payments made annually. Here are 7 reasons to consider accepting checks.…",31-05-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/7-benefits-of-accepting-checks/,"Checks are still a very popular way to pay for purchases. In fact, the Federal Reserve reports more than 17 billion check payments are paid annually with a total value of more than $26 trillion dollars. And despite newer payment options, a consumer brand awareness study from TeleCheck, A First Data Company, reported that many customers feel checks are a safer way to pay for large-ticket items. In fact, the average check amount is three times that of the average credit card swipe. That’s a pretty big incentive for merchants to accept checks.
With TeleCheck, there are even more benefits to accepting checks:

Happier customers. Some customers simply prefer to pay via check—don’t risk losing out on this business. Offer an array of payment choices, including payment by check, so customers feel comfortable buying from you no matter how they prefer to buy.


Reduced bank fees. Check processing fees are more affordable than other popular payment methods—including credit cards.


Less risk. TeleCheck’s warranty service helps protect merchants against bad check losses on approved checks, and thus minimizes risk. With one of the industry’s most robust check authorization systems, TeleCheck assesses transaction risk and advises on whether to accept or decline the transaction in seconds, so you can close a sale with confidence.


Improved cash flow. Approved checks are paid within two banking days, which is twice as fast as traditional methods.


More time. You can accept checks electronically, without having to make a stop at the bank, which saves you valuable time you need to run your business.


More flexibility. Check processing software works on mobile devices, including phones and tablets, so that customers can transact with you via check virtually anywhere, including sidewalk sales, shows, and events.


Better customer relationships. Develop trust and credibility with your customers: First Data’s payment processing protects your customers’ personal information from identity theft every time they pay.

Although there are more advanced payment methods out there, it still pays to take checks from the millions of customers who prefer to use them. Luckily, with TeleCheck, you can take checks electronically in seconds with ease and confidence.

Accepting checks just got easier. New Clover customers who are signed up for Clover Check Acceptance will have this feature already installed on their device. Learn more on Clover.com.

Note: Existing Clover customers can download the Check Acceptance app in the Clover App Market.

news_190,news,5 questions to ask when a customer has a complaint,"Customer complaints can be high-alert moments. Small business owners risk not only losing the customer, but also inflaming the problem and triggering negative reviews. Here are some tips to de-escalate situations, get at underlying issues, and head off future complaints.…",01-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-customer-complaint/,"Customer complaints are high-alert moments. Beyond just losing this one person, small business owners risk escalating the situation and causing the customer to vent online.
The most pressing need is to quickly resolve the problem, whether by replacing an overcooked entree, apologizing for an employee’s behavior, or offering a refund to an upset reviewer. Promptness, professionalism, and graciousness are essential.
That doesn’t mean, however, that the complaint is completely legitimate. Everyone has stories of customers who are impossible to please. Generally, though, it’s best to right a perceived wrong, regardless of who is at fault.
On the other hand, complaints can point to problems with a process or employee. Next time a customer complains, use this strategic 5-question approach to de-escalate the situation, get at underlying issues, and head off future complaints.
1. What happened to make the customer upset?
It’s critical to stop and actively listen. Gather details, take notes if necessary, and show real concern for customers by empathizing with their frustration. When business owners put themselves in another person’s shoes, they’re less likely to feel dismissive or annoyed with the customer—and more ready to leap into action.
A word of caution—some customers come with a level of hostility and anger that can trigger a response in kind. “When you’re dealing with a crazy person, your body sends you danger signals. This is your reptile brain telling you to either fight or flee,” explains psychiatrist and communications expert Mark Goulston. “But if the crazy person is part of your professional life, neither of these responses is going to solve your problem.”
Instead, he suggests “leaning into” the crazy: recognizing what’s happening, showing that you’re not a threat, and moving the other person to a place of sanity with conciliatory words and actions.
2. How can I fix the problem for them?
Sincere apologies are the first step to calming a customer. Next, redirect the conversation away from negative emotions and toward solutions.
Find the quickest, most logical way to rectify the immediate problem. Returning, replacing, discounting—use the method that works best. If further research is required, stay on top of the matter and get back to the person ASAP. Finally, confirm that the customer is satisfied with the outcome.
Small business owners can also proactively prepare for complaints by learning about common triggers: unknowledgeable employees, rudeness, inaccessibility, and unresolved problems. Employee training and a commitment to running a top-notch business can prevent many customer service stumbles.
3. What does the staff say happened?
While customers frequently complain about attitudes, inattentiveness, poor service, and bad information, that’s not always the full picture. Dig deeper by talking to staff members involved in an incident.
Are there inconsistencies in how employees tell the story and what the customer said? Perhaps the customer is a “barnacle” who is never happy and always looking for a handout. Or, more alarming, perhaps employees are less than honest in their recounting.
The mostly likely explanation, however, is that someone made an honest mistake or lacks information and insight. In many instances, a staff member may be communicating a policy in an unclear way, sticking to the rules too literally, or floundering to find a solution for the customer. All of these can be fixed with training and guidance.
4. How can you minimize lasting damage on Yelp?
It’s every small business owner’s nightmare: one small misstep blows up and the customer posts a scathing review online. When mistakes come to light through in-person complaints, they need to be quickly resolved. The goal is to make the customer happy and, as a result, keep the complaint out of the public eye.
Often, though, small business owners find out about problems once they appear on Yelp and similar sites. Reputation management specialist Darius Fisher suggests responding promptly online to show concern for the customer and commitment to running a great business. Some customers will remove the review voluntarily when they feel recognized and compensated. Under no circumstances, however, should a business owner try to game the system.
“It is actually impossible [for business owners] to remove reviews, unless they violate Yelp’s terms of service,” Fisher advises. In addition, trying to bury the negative review with fake positive reviews can backfire. “Getting caught purchasing reviews will result in a public shaming courtesy of Yelp,” he cautions.
Actively soliciting feedback from customers can also help limit damage. Feedback and Owner Listens in the Clover App Marketplace help small business owners reach out to customers and open honest dialogue—in private.
5. How can I keep this from happening again?
No one is perfect. Mistakes will happen. Minimizing complaints and expertly solving problems are the real goals.
To get there, business owners should focus on steady improvements and knowledge building. Training staff, fine-tuning processes, and empowering employees to find great solutions will go a long way to reducing the volume and intensity of customer complaints.
Remember, many customers are neutral on a business until it’s been tested by a real complaint. Either the business steps up and wows them, or it disappoints. Handling problems well is a chance to shine.

Gone are the days where customers had to come to you to purchase goods or services. It’s a mobile-first, go anywhere world now. Realizing business happens everywhere nowadays, it’s essential for your business to have a POS system that handles offsite sales seamlessly. We designed the new Clover Flex with precisely these needs in mind. Clover Flex is a full-featured POS device that brings payment anywhere your business takes you.
This post will show you a few features you should look for when upgrading your POS to work offsite. And by “offsite sales,” we’re talking selling your products at food trucks, outdoor church bazaars, sidewalk sales, farmer’s markets – any location that’s not your usual place of business. It could also cover traveling plumbers who want to take payment directly at the customer’s home. Same thing for home contractors, cleaning services, and home health aides. (If you haven’t figured out the theme yet, the Clover Flex is…flexible.)
Offline functionality
With offsite sales, the selling environment is, by definition, unpredictable. You have no idea if you’ll have wifi or even cell service, or if you’ll have a convenient power source or not. Conditions might change from day to day, location to location, even hour to hour. Flex can process transactions even when it’s totally offline — so you’re not dependent on wifi or a mobile signal. And with a charge that’s designed to last a full work day, you know you won’t have to worry about staying close to an outlet.
Security
When merchants are on the go, device theft is a real concern. Could a random person swipe this expensive and cool-looking device off their counter and wreak havoc security-wise for your business? Not with Clover Flex. Designed with security top-of-mind, only authorized employees can use the device to process transactions, affording you the same functionality and top-shelf security you’d enjoy from a countertop POS.
Durability
When you’re working away from your store, conditions vary. You could be outside battling weather or driving down a dirt road to a customer’s destination. No matter what situations you encounter, the rugged Flex will be up to the task. It’s sturdy enough to withstand getting knocked around in a food truck or being dropped on a construction site. It also doesn’t take up much room — key for tight selling quarters like food trucks.
Seamlessness
The last thing you need to worry about when you’re offsite is syncing the day’s transactions with your in-store POS. That’s why Clover Flex transactions feed directly back into the central hub of your Clover POS. This ensures you’ll always have the latest sales and inventory data, eliminating worries about a silo of sales activity that doesn’t communicate with the home base. 
With its ability to accept payments wherever the customers are — at home, on the sidewalk, in the street, and everywhere else, Clover Flex truly gives you the ability to get every job done well — no matter where that job happens.

news_192,news,New & notable in the Clover App Market: June 2017,"This summer, spend more time with your customers. New & Notable in the Clover App Market: an app that syncs your sales to your accounting software; a smooth way to collect customer waivers; and a restaurant app that does everything but the cooking.
…",05-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-clover-app-market-june-2017/,"Summer is here, and what better way to celebrate than by spending less time in the weeds of your business and more time with your customers? New apps in the Clover App Market are here to help you run your business efficiently (and spend some time in the sun!).
The Clover App Market offers a wide variety of apps all geared toward creating a powerful business center customized to your unique goals. This month we feature an app that automatically syncs your sales data to your accounting software, a smooth way to collect customer waivers, and an app that gives you deeper insights into your restaurant’s performance metrics.
Commerce Sync
Have you ever wished that a team of tiny elves would enter your sales and transaction data into your accounting software for you? Here’s an app that’s better than elves: Commerce Sync.
Commerce Sync updates your sales information automatically to give you a clear picture of how your business is growing day by day. Transfer sales from multiple locations into one invoice that syncs with QuickBooks Online, Quickbooks Desktop, or Xero. Commerce Sync delivers a clear report with data and business analytics to give you a quick insight into your company’s performance. You can use Commerce Sync to track payment methods (cash, credit, etc.), tax, and sales by category.
A little behind on bookkeeping? Commerce Sync can help with that. Even if you’re a year behind schedule, the historical transfer feature will help you catch up on updating previous sales data. Spend less time keeping track of your sales, and more time connecting with customers. Magic!
Release, Waiver, Compliance
If you have a business that requires customers to sign a waiver—gym, spa, or adventure travel company, for example—this app is for you. Release, Waiver, Compliance integrates directly into Clover’s checkout process to provide a seamless waiver and documentation experience.
How does it work? Customers can view, fill out, and sign any compliance documents directly on Clover. You will instantly receive a signed copy with all images to your email account. The app also lets you capture a driver’s license or ID card. Release, Waiver, Compliance eliminates the need to print and scan form after form. It can integrate into check-out or be used a standalone app, and is fully scalable as your business grows.
Avero Integration
One minute it’s cronuts, the next it’s unicorn frappes. Avero Integration may not be able to cook up the next big foodie trend, but this app packs a punch. Avero Integration gives you analytics into all aspects of your restaurant’s performance. It stores transactions, orders, sales data, and customer receipts in a user-friendly interface that allows you to search by nearly any identifier. Use Avero Integration to track the popularity of particular menu items—like cronuts—and see how your sales are affected by weather or special events.
If your restaurant has multiple locations that use different POS systems, Avero Integration has you covered. Reports from each part of the app can be sent to your team via email to keep everyone up to speed on how the restaurant is running. See how it works with this quick video.

Like these apps? There’s more where these came from. New apps are being added to the Clover App Market all the time. Check out the latest today!

news_193,news,4 surefire ways to help local shoppers find your products,"How can local merchants get discovered during product searches online, and generally become more top-of-mind as a resource for shoppers seeking their favorite products fast? Read on for 4 great tips.…",06-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/4-surefire-ways-help-local-shoppers-find-products/,"As a retailer today, your first instinct when you think about customers searching for one of your specific products is: they’ll find it online. But, is that really true? This blog will answer that question and highlight a few ways you can help your local customers find your products a little easier.
You might be surprised to hear that more than 90% of retail still happens offline. In spite of that number, customers searching for a specific product nowadays definitely tend to go online first in an attempt to find it. However, they often don’t realize that product may be stocked at a store within minutes of their homes. The question then becomes: How can local merchants get discovered during product searches online, and generally become more top-of-mind as a resource for shoppers seeking their favorite products fast?
Below are four suggestions.
1. Discover Pointy
Pointy is a new app that helps Clover merchants get discovered in local searches for products. As soon as you install Pointy, it automatically creates an online page featuring your store’s products, complete with images and names. Pointy helps your store to rank on page one of local search results. This directs people nearby who are doing Google searches for products that you stock to visit your store, instead of just ordering the product they’re searching for online. Best of all, there’s no need to manually enter product names and images or worry about building and optimising your website. Pointy does all the work for you.
2. Check your site
Of course, all of this isn’t to say Pointy is a silver bullet for search. One of the easiest steps you can take to help local shoppers find your products is to make sure your website’s search function delivers optimal results for specific products. For example, say you know you sell a lot of a certain brand of product. Have you checked your website recently to see if product searches for that brand show up the way you’d expect? It may seem obvious, but it’s shocking how many retailers don’t perform due diligence on their own sites.
3. Embrace e-commerce
A smart, fully integrated e-commerce site like Clover Online can check inventory for product availability. Make sure you give customers an easy and obvious next step if a product is unavailable, like a big ORDER NOW button and, if possible, an estimate on delivery time. Follow up with an individual contact (phone or email) so that the customer knows you’re responsive and on top of the order.
4. Get in the know
Don’t have a good handle on your best-selling products? The Insights app can give you great intel on your top sellers so you can ensure you’re always in stock. You can even notify customers who’ve purchased that item a lot in the past when a new shipment comes in. This type of super-tailored marketing can be useful for customers and very effective for your business.
It should be noted that you can find all of these solutions to help your customers find your products easier in the Clover App Market. As always, we’re here to help you run your business better. So, if you have any questions about anything this blog discussed or just want to talk to one of our experts, please feel free to reach out.

news_194,news,Business problem turnaround: Obsolete products,"Trends come and go, and consumer tastes change faster than you can say “blockbuster.” Nevertheless, you don’t need to completely reinvent the wheel to stay relevant. Here’s how to keep your business from becoming obsolete.
…",07-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-obsolete-products/,"Is the fear of becoming obsolete keeping you up at night? Even the best products and businesses face a conundrum. How do you stay relevant in a fast-evolving market? You could wait for your product to have a renaissance period ten years from now (the 90s are most definitely back), but that doesn’t seem like the best business plan. While obsolescence can threaten any business, this might be particularly relevant for bookstores, video rental shops, and a host of other retailers who face technological challenges.
Trends come and go, and consumer tastes change faster than you can say “blockbuster.” Nevertheless, you don’t need to completely reinvent the wheel to enjoy a lifelong relationship with your best customers (and bring new fans through the door). Here are some ways you can mitigate the risk of becoming obsolete.
Focus on solving a customer’s problem.
New products are created every day to try to meet the same needs customers have felt for decades. Even as technology changes, the impetus for building that technology remains the same. Don’t lose sight of the core need that your customer is trying to meet.
For example, if you’re a bakery, happiness never goes out of style. There will always be an occasion to celebrate and a moment where a cupcake can solve everything. Rather than trying to push cronuts, think about that little something that’s going to add happiness to your customer’s day. Gather feedback to get to the heart of what your customers are truly looking for, and evolve your business accordingly.
Take it offline.
It might be tempting to rely on social media to reach more customers (and that’s certainly one way to go). However, research shows that customers value experiences when looking to make a purchase. Millennials especially want to feel like they’re a part of something. “Millennials want a customer-centric experience in which they feel wanted and valued. Whether it is in-store or through social media channels, showing interest in these shoppers creates loyalty.”
What’s the best way to create a personalized experience? Take it offline. Host live events for your local community to bring people together. Foster a relationship with like-minded fans, whether you host a book club reading or a live music event. Curate unique experiences that bring people together and bring fresh faces through your door. Consider how you’ll monetize those experiences, too: a 10% discount for book club attendees, perhaps?
Promote your expertise.
Since Netflix changed its rating system from five stars to thumbs up or down, online streamers have been beyond confused. Guess what? If you own a video rental store, that’s a big opportunity for you to promote your expertise. Give customers your recommendations to help them find their next favorite movie, and they’ll love you forever.
If your product is going obsolete, that may be because it’s been around forever. That means you’ve build knowledge in a particular area over the years, and that institutional knowledge is invaluable. Find a way to monetize that insight with a subscription-only newsletter, for example, or by hosting classes in your relevant skill area.
Branch out.
You might be the go-to destination for console video games. Now that consoles are forced to compete with apps and online games, it’s time to evolve. One way to do that is to branch out. What similar, related products can you offer? Is there a way to co-market with another business to continue serving your customer base?
Think of ways you can continue to reach your gamer fans by making it easy for them to patronize your business. Consider hosting profiles that people can sign up to play from, or offering a subscription service for certain online games at a discount. Go omnichannel: some physical bookstores will advertise the fact that you can buy e-books from them, for example. Libraries will offer magazine subscriptions at a discounted rate. There are plenty of creative ways to continue to stay relevant. Think outside the box!

news_195,news,What top candidates look for in a job description,"Hiring qualified candidates is tough. Standing out is important, but putting all the vital information in your job description will also save you time as you’re screening applicants. Here are some things to be mindful of as you put a job description together.
…",12-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/top-candidates-look-job-description/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. Read more employee management posts from Homebase and other Staffing & Human Resources articles here on the Clover blog.
Hiring qualified candidates is tough. In major cities like Houston, there are around 650 job postings a day on Craigslist for hourly employees. In Los Angeles, there are 800! Standing out is important, but putting all the vital information in your job description will also save you time as you’re screening applicants. Here are some things to be mindful of as you put a job description together:
1. Detailed Requirements
Too often, managers will write the job description after they’ve found their newest employee, planning to tailor the job specifics to the individual’s strengths and interests. In the haste to hire an employee, managers settle for someone who doesn’t have the exact set of skills that are truly needed.
Instead, start with a detailed job description first, and find the person that meets those needs rather than the other way around.
Be clear about your minimum requirements including any certifications, skills, or years of experience. It’ll save you hours sorting through applications and ensure you hire the employee you need.
2. The Perks
No perk is too small to brag about. Show that your business values its employees. Mention the team building events you host. Mention any free meals provided when an employee is on shift. Mention if schedules are flexible enough to accommodate students or mothers. Mention any opportunities you provide to train for other positions. You’ve got to do a bit of selling to make your business stand out.
3. The Hourly Wage
A lot of managers prefer to negotiate the wage rate, rather than setting one outright, but you could end up wasting a lot of time. Realistically, most businesses have a narrow wage band for a given position, so it’s best to be upfront about it. If not, you’ll end up wasting time on applicants and interviews with people who may be looking for a different wage rate at their next job.
When figuring out how much to pay, keep in mind that the higher you pay, the fewer times you will have to hire for that position. A wage increase of 50 cents an hour equates to $1000/year per full-time hourly employee and Homebase data indicates can reduce turnover. This will save you far more money in lost time recruiting and training a replacement.
4. A Simple Process
It’s important to be realistic. The good news is that most of your applicants will be looking for work immediately, which is likely what you’re looking for, too. But that means you may need to relax expectations around their passion for working at your business specifically, or formalities like a cover letter. Focus on finding people who meet the requirements for your job posting. Otherwise, you may miss out on qualified applicants just by making them jump through too many hoops. Plus, the passion for your specific business and team can come later, once they meet you!

news_197,news,Enterprise behavior: Going green,"Going green is more than just a social obligation. Being environmentally friendly offers business benefits such as reduced waste, better efficiency, and tax breaks. Here are 6 ways small business can go green.…",14-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-going-green/,"Learn more about the processes, initiatives and habits of enterprise businesses, and how you can adopt those processes to help your business run better.
Going green is more than just a social obligation. Being environmentally friendly offers business benefits such as reduced waste, better efficiency, and tax breaks. In addition, many customers prefer to support brands that are green—operating your business in an eco-friendly manner can improve trust in your brand and help drive business.
Here are 6 steps businesses can take to run green.
1. Reduce your light usage.
Replace your light bulbs with more energy efficient versions. Make sure to turn them off at night, too!
2. Maintain your HVAC system.
Heating and cooling systems use a lot of energy, so keep them in good working order. Consider replacing systems more than 10 years old with newer Energy Star systems. Yearly maintenance can reduce energy costs by 5 to 40% depending on the system.
3. Switch to energy-efficient devices and appliances.
You’d be surprised how much energy you can save by switching to Energy Star-qualified products. Refrigerators that were built after 2001 use up to two-thirds less energy than older models. Energy Star appliances use up to 20% less energy than standard models, so consider whether upgrading is a good investment. (Don’t forget to recycle your older appliances.) Sometimes even switching the type of equipment you use can lead to huge energy savings. Laptops, for example, use up to 80% less energy than desktop models.
4. Conserve water.
The average business consumes 480,000 cubic meters of water per year. Replacing older faucets and toilets can reduce water use by as much as 20%, and may offer tax rebates as well. (Check your local tax authority for details.) Consider making small changes that can add up. For example, if you’re a restaurant, don’t automatically offer water to every customer—wait for them to ask for it. If you have an outdoor space, consider using environmentally-friendly landscaping that requires very little water.
5. Be mindful of local environmental issues.
Some areas have special concerns such as local endangered species or fragile habitats nearby. Check what environmental regulations are mandated in your area and make sure you comply with them.
6. Reduce, reuse, and recycle as much as possible.
Train employees to be mindful of supplies, and creative in how to reduce waste as long as it is sanitary. Reuse materials when possible, and recycle the rest. Make it easy for customers to recycle in your store, and make sure any packaging or bags you use are also recyclable.
Being ecologically responsible can seem daunting when you first get started. Spark your commitment to going green with something small, and stick with it. Once a quarter, re-evaluate whether you can take it to the next level. Every small change adds up.

news_198,news,Business trends & research roundup: Do sales actually work?,"Running price promotions can be a great way for small businesses to get customers in the door. But what types of deals lead to actual sales? Our research roundup reveals which deep discounts lead to higher profits.
 
…",15-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-trends-research-roundup-sales-actually-work/,"What are the experts, surveys and latest research reports saying about small business and consumer trends? Welcome to our monthly roundup of research small businesses can use to do business better.
What does research say about sales? How can small businesses use price promotions effectively to drive sales? Are there any downsides? Our monthly roundup of research will help you run your business better.
Sales make a difference
Almost half of all consumers—44 percent to be exact—are “increasingly looking for ways to save money.” For some, that means buying lower-quality items or shopping at more bargain stores. But, 31 percent of shoppers save money by purchasing their preferred brand, but only when it was on sale or with a coupon. McKinsey & Co
Have smart sales
Flash sales are not a flash in the pan. More than half of businesses have found that click-to-open rates on emails for these promotions are higher than for regular correspondence. Flash sales that last three hours have transaction-to-click rates that are 59 percent higher than average. Experian Marketing Services
Double discounts could lead to increased sales because shoppers think they’re getting a better deal. That’s because consumers perceive one markdown followed by a second markdown as greater than a single discount, even when the later technically saves them more money. Journal of Consumer Research
Step discounts, such as offering 15 percent off for purchases up to $100, 20 percent off purchases between $100 and $250, and 25 percent for purchases over $250, encourages customers to buy additional products or spend more at a single retailer. Harvard Business Review
Shoppers like free stuff
Consumers greatly prefer to get something for free instead of receiving a discount. Researchers found that 73 percent more items were sold when a product was offered in a bonus pack than when it carried an equivalent discount. Journal of Marketing
Ninety-three percent of shoppers have taken advantage of BOGO (buy one, get one) deals. Two-thirds of shoppers report that BOGOs are their favorite promotions. Their next favorite deal? Getting a discount (whether it be dollars or just cents) off an item. AMG Strategic Advisors
Not all sales are great
How low can you go? It’ll cost you if you go too low. Between 80 and 90 percent of poor pricing decisions are made by setting a price that’s too cheap. McKinsey & Co
What shoppers don’t want: complicated promotions. Less than half have taken advantage of meal deals or buying multiple items to get a discount later on. AMG Strategic Advisors
Frequent promotions won’t necessarily lead to higher sales. Shoppers are perceptive and they’ll remember if you discounted an item at a higher rate in the past, leading them to view the current deal as inferior. PwC

news_199,news,Business accelerators: 6 ways pop ups can help your business,"Pop ups are a kind of “flash” retailing—a short-term sales space where businesses can take advantage of temporary demand. Check out these 6 ways to reach your business goals with a pop-up. 
…",20-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-6-ways-pop-ups-can-help-business/,"Pop ups are a kind of “flash” retailing—a short-term sales space where businesses can take advantage of temporary demand. Even big brands such as Target and Levis take advantage of pop-ups because they are a cost-effective way to bring in extra cash, experiment with products or locations, and make use of “dead” space.
Here are 6 reasons to try a pop-up location:
1. Reduce the costs of business.
Pop ups only pay real estate costs for the time they are using the space. This can really help fledgling businesses start to build up capital until they are able to afford a more permanent location.
2. Capitalize on seasonal markets.
Pop ups are ideal for seasonal businesses. Halloween stores, summer tourist shops, and Christmas stores can capitalize on a limited market without investing a lot of money.
3. Draw a crowd.
Some pop-ups help attract more business. One business alone might not generate a lot of foot traffic, but sharing space can help generate interest and partnership opportunities that would not otherwise exist. For example, an eyebrow threading business could pop up at a hair salon, or a henna artist could create a pop up within a nail salon.
4. Improve visibility.
Experimenting with pop ups help small businesses get in front of new traffic flows and new customers. For example, perhaps your business is not on the main thoroughfare. Experimenting with a pop up in a more central location can be a way to market to customers who may not have noticed your business before. Include signage, business cards, or perhaps coupons to encourage foot traffic in the regular storefront. Alternately, trying a pop up in a mall during sale seasons are a great way to get the word out about your business.
5. Test a new location.
Pop ups also allow businesses to try out completely new locations, including new cities. The Insights app can show you where your customers live so you don’t poach customers from your current location. It can also show you where customers with similar demographics live or how similar businesses perform in a specific area.
6. Test a new product.
Some chefs open pop ups to experiment with new dishes without interrupting their current business. A pop up allows them complete creative license to try whatever they want, see what diners like, and test out alternative price points.
When considering a pop up, make sure to examine all legal issues—special licenses required, or restrictions on use of space—in your rental agreement. There are also logistical challenges that should be addressed, such as transporting goods and having adequate utilities like water and electricity. Pop ups are an exciting, scrappy way to accelerate business, but require careful planning.
Research pop up locations with the Insights app from the Clover App Market.

news_200,news,Business scenario: Dealing with super-demanding customers,"Customer service is critical to any business, and the personal touch is particularly important for a small business that’s aiming to fit in as part of a community. But it is possible to take customer service too far. Some customers are simply too demanding. 
…",21-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-dealing-super-demanding-customers/,"This post is part of our Business Scenario series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
Does it seem like customers today are more demanding than ever? Getting anything you want at the click of a button online can make you a little impatient with the slower pace of a real-world interaction.
But the customer is always right–right? Customer service is critical to any business, and the personal touch is particularly important for a small business that’s aiming to fit in as part of a community. But it is possible to take customer service too far. Some customers are simply too demanding. Some requests simply can’t be fulfilled.
Here are 5 types of demanding customers, and some strategies for handling them:
1. The Discount Diva
This customer always has a reason for getting a discount. Maybe the item she wants to buy is a display model. Maybe he’s found some microscopic damage. Maybe she’s just a haggler. Of course, you always want to keep the customer happy. But you also can’t give away your merchandise for free.
Handling strategy: Set a maximum discount policy, and make sure your staff knows it’s a firm rule. They can use this rule as a backstop when talking to customers. “I’m sorry, it’s company policy” is a great way to shut down discussion. Staff can then redirect the customer to another product if they don’t seem satisfied.
2. The Returnenator
A generous return policy is a great way to keep customers loyal. But this customer takes advantage of your generosity. He repeatedly returns items, and sometimes they’re obviously used or even damaged. Your policy has always been that satisfaction is guaranteed, and returns are accepted with no questions asked, but this person is pushing the limits.
Handling strategy: The next time this customer attempts to return an item, alert them that they have reached their limit of allowable returns for the year. Explain that as a small business, you are grateful for their loyalty, but need to protect your assets by setting limits on returns or exchanges. Notify your staff that they can only accept returns or exchanges from this customer if the product is unopened, tags on, or otherwise in mint condition.
3. The Staff Hog
This customer has a lot of questions. A lot of questions. She takes up a lot of your staff’s time, but doesn’t buy much. He’s a time-suck. You want your staff to be attentive, but you don’t want one window-shopper to take up all their time.
Handling strategy: Ask this person to make an appointment next time they want to come in. Pitch it as a perk and offer them a personal shopper who will prepare some products to show them and answer all of their questions. This way, you can prepare for the time-suck and plan accordingly.
4. The Promo-Haggler
Every time you run a promotion, this customer shows up. He wants to get the promotional price after the sale is over. She wants to apply the discount to a product that isn’t on sale.
Handling strategy: Make sure every promotion comes with fine print, and empower your staff to enforce the rules. Allow your staff to use their judgment—they can bend the rules when it feels appropriate, but become sticklers as soon as they spot someone who seems like they’re trying to work the system.
5. The VVVIP
Don’t you know who this person is? It’s true, she is a loyal repeat customer. But he seems to think that entitles him to interrupt your staff when they’re helping other customers, cut in line, get special discounts, put items on hold even though you don’t have a hold policy, etc. It all makes you wonder how much a loyal customer is really worth.
Handling strategy: Time for some psychology. Have your staff make a show of taking this person into their confidence. Make them feel like they’re part of the team—and make it clear that a team player waits their turn. And make sure you have a program in place for rewarding loyal customers, within reason.
A rewards program is a great way to make sure you keep your best customers happy, without hurting your bottom line. A program like Insights can help you build your loyalty program on data, not on who complains the most.

news_201,news,3 reasons to strive for a smart product mix,"As a retailer, your inventory is your lifeblood. Invariably, sales will only be as good as your inventory is at meeting the diverse needs of your customer base. That’s why it’s so important to make sure your store carries a carefully considered assortment of products. …",22-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-reasons-strive-smart-product-mix/,"As a retailer, your inventory is your lifeblood. Invariably, sales will only be as good as your inventory is at meeting the diverse needs of your customer base. That’s why it’s so important to make sure your store carries a carefully considered assortment of products. This blog will take a look at three reasons you need to strive for a smart product mix.
1. It can provide a jumping-off point for lasting, profitable customer relationships.
This might seem obvious, but plenty of retailers have secured lifelong customers simply by carrying a product their competitors don’t. In an effort to help you do just that, we suggest installing a new app from Clover called Pointy. Its purpose is simple—help merchants get discovered in local searches for products.
As soon as you install Pointy, it automatically creates an online page featuring your store’s products, complete with images and names. Pointy helps your store rank on page one of local search results. This directs people nearby who are doing Google searches for products that you stock to visit your store, instead of just ordering the product they’re searching for online. Best of all, there’s no need to manually enter product names and images or worry about building and optimizing your website. Pointy does all the work for you. Overall, it’s a great way to drive new foot traffic in the door and establish a new customer relationship—particularly if the product is unusual or a specialty item.
2. It can demonstrate your deep knowledge of customers’ interests and needs.
Don’t have a good handle on your best-selling products? Insights (also from Clover) can give you great intel on your top sellers so you can ensure you’re always in stock. It might also surprise you with valuable opportunities. For instance, you might already know about one hot-selling item, but Insights can help you learn about a fast-emerging new product. Products that pair well together can meet a customer’s needs better while increasing purchase amounts. A fan of one particular brand might be interested to learn about a brand-new product launch from the same company. Your VIPs might be buying a lot of one product you weren’t aware of as a hot seller, but because they love it, you should probably pay closer attention. Conversely, you can prune away products that are poor performers or taking up valuable inventory space.
3. It can differentiate your brand.
A smart product mix can give merchants ample marketing opportunities to distance themselves from their competition. For instance, you can notify customers who’ve purchased an item in the past when a new shipment comes in. Or invite VIP customers for an exclusive early-bird sale on a product they love. You could even host a tasting for customers whose product purchases suggests they might be up for trying something new. The net result is helping you deliver unique customer service experiences no one else can match.
Being smart with your inventory can help you stand out from a crowd, make you more attractive to customers, and go a long way in helping you build lasting relationships with your best customers. Be bold with your product mix—your bottom line will thank you for it.

news_202,news,Team leadership: Teaching customer service skills,"Contrary to what many people think, the ability to be great at sales is a skill that can be taught and learned. Inside, we’ve outlined several tips leaders can employ in training the next generation of great salespersons.
…",26-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/team-leadership-teaching-customer-service-skills/,"For some people, the skillset of a good salesperson come naturally.
These skills—approaching anyone, making a connection, chatting them up, and directing the conversation in a natural way—often appear to be personality traits rather than learned abilities. The ability to provide good customer service, however, is a skill that can be taught. Not only that, but it is the responsibility of a small business to provide the training and team development to make sure that all employees are comfortable and empowered on the floor.
So how do you teach top-notch customer service skills to someone who might need a little help learning the ins and outs of salesmanship? Below, we’ve outlined several tips sales managers can employ to create a frustration-free customer service training environment for the next generation of great salespersons.
Teach active listening.
For someone to learn to become a great salesperson, they’ve first got to learn how to be a great listener. This may be the most fundamental aspect of customer service, since every customer generally just wants their needs to be heard and understood.
To teach your staff to become great, active listeners, present a variety of scenarios that include typical coded language customers might use to address sensitive situations, i.e. needs they might not be comfortable discussing with a stranger.
For example, those of atypical body shape sometimes have a hard time communicating clearly what they’re looking for in terms of clothing. The same goes for someone buying a gift out of obligation rather than genuine sentiment, or someone who’s unfamiliar with technology making an expensive investment in a new device.
In training your staff for these scenarios, ask them first look for non-verbal cues that might flag the customer as feeling insecure about their selections or requests. Part of being a great listener is watching the speaker and seeing the things their faces, perhaps their hands, are communicating in addition to their words.
It’s also important to teach your staff to listen for vocal inflections, pauses, or emphasis on certain words. It can be useful to reflect back to the customer what you’re hearing to make sure you understand them correctly. When customers feel understood, they are much more likely to trust guidance from a salesperson.
Focus less on words or scripts, and more on energy and tone.
For many companies, reliance on a script seems to make sense. By outlining for employees exactly what they should say, they hope to minimize variance in the customer-service experience.
The problem with scripts is that, sure, a salesperson can say all the right words, but if their energy isn’t in the right place, it won’t read as sincere or helpful. If the interaction seems insincere or canned, it immediately squashes any hopes for the building of rapport.
Instead, describe the desired energy levels of staffers and how that supports the brand identity of the merchant. It might help to describe the vibe a salesperson should be expressing to others through both verbal and non-verbal communication.
When teaching your staff to navigate both positive and negative interactions with customers, you can reference specific vocabulary a salesperson might use and ask the staffer if they feel like those words reflect the desired energy.
This way your staff gets an understanding for the type of energy they should be displaying, but at the same time allows for flexibility and individuality in the way they interact with customers, creating individual sales approaches that may differ, but are still consistent with your brand.
Provide ample opportunity for practice.
There are a million and one platitudes about practice, but the reason so much has been said about practice is because it works.
Start with role-playing. It can feel hokey, but it also can be hugely helpful in developing comfort with new situations. In fact, it’s crucial when cultivating instincts in customer service. Have staffers role-play with each other representing actual customers, and challenges that were met (either successfully or unsuccessfully) so you can observe and reinforce excellent service.
Especially important to practice are those sensitive topic customers discussed above. Write customer roles that are about specific situations a customer might be reluctant to discuss so your staff can have practice in recognizing subtext and responding accordingly.
As a next step, have a less-experienced salesperson shadow someone more experienced. Provide time for them to discuss specifics of the interactions in a “post-game analysis.”
Finally, trainers should shadow trainees occasionally for a few weeks to ensure lessons are sticking and to provide trainees opportunity to ask questions about specific situations they’ve experienced.
Sales greatness starts from the top
It’s important to remember that a team can have all the training in the world, but they take their cues from leadership. If the tone and energy exuded by management is anything less than what is expected of salespersons, they will pick up on that and customer service will suffer.
It’s management’s duty to serve as role models, providing excellent communication internally as well as to customers.
If you treat everyone you interact with with the same energy and genuine interest you expect of your team, you’re already well on your way to developing a top-notch customer service team.

news_203,news,Growing pains: Selling out of a popular product,"Sure, running out of a bestseller is a good problem to have, but it’s certainly stress-inducing. You can keep customers happy, however, even when their “gotta have it” item is on backorder.…",27-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-selling-popular-product/,"There are good problems and bad problems. As a small business owner, having a popular product fly off the shelves is one of the good ones to have. It demonstrates your ability to hit your target audience by selling exactly what your customers want at the price they’re willing to pay.
That’s not to say the situation is stress-free. Having an empty shelf or bin when customers are looking for that must-have item can be particularly nerve-racking, especially since it can take you by surprise.
So what’s a savvy small business owner to do? The key is communication.
Think of a time you were stuck on a delayed airplane, just sitting on the tarmac. Instead of receiving regular status updates, it was radio silence from the cockpit. As the minutes ticked by, you probably got madder and madder. Frequent announcements about the problem wouldn’t have gotten you to your destination any faster, but the knowledge would’ve given you some peace of mind.
The same holds true for a sold-out product.
As soon as an item is out of stock, use in-store signage and labeling on your website to acknowledge its status. (It’s wrong to allow a customer to place an order online only to find out later on that it’s currently unavailable.) Continue to accept back orders, so you don’t lose customers to a merchant down the street or another online retailer. Whatever you do, don’t go silent. Customers, just like the passengers stuck on an airplane waiting for take off, want to know they haven’t been forgotten in their time of need. Keep track of everyone on the waiting list by using your CRM app.
Soon after a shopper purchases the backordered product, send them an email acknowledging their predicament and informing them a restocking date. Maintain regular communication via the omnichannel bLoyal Suite, which offers responsive, personalized marketing to be sent via email, text messages, and social blasts. Each message should include any timing status—both good and bad. Even if you don’t have any update, reach out anyway. Any communication is always better than no communication.
If the sold-out product is a seasonal or time-sensitive item, you’ll need to rethink your strategy. And by rethink, we mean go above and beyond. Consider running a loss-leading sale. Sure, it would cut into your short-term profits, but it could pay off in the long-term by retaining valuable customers.
To be better prepared the next time customers go gangbusters for something you’re selling, lean into inventory apps like Shopventory. It tracks both current and historical inventory levels—helping you to anticipate with greater accuracy the items that your customers might deem hot sellers. Similarly, the Insights apps uses easy-to-comprehend charts and graphs to better track current sales.
Small business owners should view sales spikes as a strategic marketing opportunity. If shoppers are particularly gung-ho about one item, then perhaps they’ll be equally as excited as similar products or related accessories. Smart merchants will run a promotion featuring some of these items or incorporate them into a loyalty program. They could do this during brisk sales or after a popular item sells out.
Ultimately, selling out of an extremely popular product is a good problem to have, but you have to capitalize on the opportunity. Use it to build relationships with new customers and to enhance connections with existing ones. Take advantage of the marketing possibilities it provides and gain better insight into the ebb and flow of your inventory.

How do I prepare?,"Although Federal Minimum Wage increases are currently on hold, 21 states and even some cities will increase minimum wage by the end of the 2017. As you prepare for a minimum wage increase, keep in mind a few tips to make the transition easier.
…",28-06-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/minimum-wage-going-prepare/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. Read more employee management posts from Homebase and other Staffing & Human Resources articles here on the Clover blog.
Although Federal Minimum Wage increases are currently on hold, 21 states and even some cities will increase minimum wage by the end of the 2017.
Small businesses bear the brunt of a minimum wage increase, with labor representing a significant percentage of cost of goods sold. For some, increasing wages can be the final straw that forces a business to close its doors. As you prepare for a minimum wage increase, keep in mind a few tips to make the transition easier.
1. Raise prices
Many small businesses are already competing against the low prices of large chains. How can you charge more for a product than your competition? Think like Starbucks and beat the competition with customer service, not with pricing. Starbucks believes that their business model is not just selling a cup of coffee, but developing an emotional relationship with their customers—they train employees to deliver exceptional customer service. Spending a few minutes each day focusing on service can make your business a place customers prefer to patronize even if the price is a bit higher.
2. Reduce hours
Cross-train staff so that during slow times you can run as lean as possible. Retailers who used to maintain two or more sales associates in the store at all times have implemented measures to allow a solo employee to cover the store. Extra security cameras and a loud door chime can allow employees to work on inventory in the back and still cover the floor. For restaurants who have servers on stand-by during the extremely slow last 30 minutes of a shift can cross-train so that front and back of the house duties can be completed with a smaller employee count.
3. Automate time-consuming tasks
Low-cost and easy-to-use tech tools are allowing small businesses to operate with the sophistication previously only large corporations could afford. The change to small business is as revolutionary as the adoption of the smartphone.
Over the years, in my role as an HR Director for both large and small businesses, I have spent hundreds of hours evaluating tech solutions for employee training, customer service, shift scheduling, recruiting, applicant tracking, and others. I could not have dreamed at the time that these services would not only become user friendly, but would be free or low cost and available to small businesses. If you think this isn’t for you because you struggle with technology, you are wrong. These tools are now unbelievably accessible. There are free or low-cost web-based tools and apps that can automatically help your employees up-sell items to customers, implement a loyalty program, easily connect with delivery services, or instantly schedule shifts and see labor as a percent of goods sold on demand. Use of these tools will allow you to increase revenue with far less labor and as a result, will offset the increase in minimum wage.
4. Eliminate low margin goods and services
Clean out old inventory and eliminate items that don’t sell or have a low return. Focus on the most profitable offerings to operate with less overhead and less staff. For retailers who struggle to part with old inventory, a rising minimum wage should be the incentive you need to make back-room tasks as efficient as possible. Eliminate the least ordered items on the menu. Only spend labor hours and inventory dollars on items that make the most return.
5. Engaging in creative marketing
Hosting events for local groups during slow periods can boost revenue which offsets labor expenses, and is a tax-deductible method to connect with more customers. Don’t wait for your customers to approach you. Offer a small discount to little leaguers for post game-day meals during off hours or donate a portion of the proceeds for groups that that host meetings at your location during off hours. Pour sangria or craft beer and let shoppers shop for a cause. This approach is a win-win as you build stronger ties to your customers by supporting their interests, draw in new customers, and increase revenue during the slow time of day
Similarly, if you’re running a food service business, offering a happy hour during the slow early evening or late night periods will help drive additional business and help you cover your labor costs.

news_205,news,Business problem turnaround: Overcoming location woes (without moving),"Savvy business owners don’t allow location woes to kill their business. Instead, what most people see as problems they view as opportunities.
 
…",05-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-overcoming-location-woes-without-moving/,"This post is part of our Business Scenario series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
If you’ve heard it once, you’ve probably heard it a million times:
Location! Location! Location!
As a small business owner, you know that location can mean the difference between killer sales and a “Going Out of Business” sign hanging in your window.
But as with just about everything in life, no location is absolutely perfect. Even if your site seems to be the location of your dreams, at some point, problems are bound to creep up. Location woes don’t have to be a business killer, though. Successful business owners view them as opportunity—using them to attract new customers or to launch new products or services.
Here are the most common location woes you’re likely to encounter and proven methods for overcoming them.
THE PROBLEM: Your café doesn’t have enough parking.
THE OPPORTUNITY: Parking is a luxury in many downtowns and quaint shopping areas. While those areas attract significant numbers of diners and shoppers, some shoppers are discouraged when they can’t find an available spot for their wheels. If you feel like your business is dropping off because some customers won’t walk from a distant parking space, consider taking your goods to the customer. With only a small amount of investment, you could launch (or expand) a delivery service that reaches customers within a nearby radius. To drive business, develop a menu that features your bestsellers, as well as some delivery-only exclusives. Price items the same as you do for dine-in service and add a delivery surcharge that’s either a percentage of the total bill or a flat rate so as not to turn off customers.
In the same vein, you could introduce a catering business. Netting a few corporate clients and boosting your business around the holidays and special occasions is certain to make up for any lost revenue at your brick-and-mortar location.
THE PROBLEM: Your business is on the second floor of a building. Visitors at street level can’t see it.
THE OPPORTUNITY: A less-than-stellar location can be a chance to get your creative juices flowing. To pique the interest of passers-by, place eye-catching signage at street level and turn your hideaway location into an intriguing advantage. If you’re willing (or can afford) to make an investment, see if your town or landlord would allow you to mount a classic fluorescent sign. Its bright colors and retro style will label you as a neighborhood landmark. For a more budget-friendly option, use chalk arrows or decals on the sidewalk to encourage foot traffic to pop in. You could also put a moveable sign in a more heavily trafficked area of the complex directing people upstairs or around the back.
THE PROBLEM: Your eatery is located in an office park that’s bustling during the day… and dead quiet at night.
THE OPPORTUNITY: The lunch service at your quick serve restaurant is almost overwhelming at times. But once 5 p.m. hits and everyone heads home, your employees are the only ones left around. Since you know how to tickle the taste buds of the noontime crowd, why not offer to cook them dinner as well? Designate an area of your eatery for pre-packaged takeaway meals that can be easily reheated in the microwave or oven — no additional ingredients, chopping, or cooking required. Just warm and serve. After a long day in the office, exhausted workers will be grateful to grab one on their way home.
THE PROBLEM: Your location is louder than you’d like.
THE OPPORTUNITY: Rock concert it’s not, but no one is going to describe the location of your salon as spa-like either. If it’s located on a noisy street or next to a highway or other loud location, consider introducing an indoor noise solution. Noise machines can provide soothing background sounds like waves or trickling water or monotonous white noise that masks disruptive racket coming from the exterior. If your salon’s atmosphere is more upbeat, think about investing in a wireless stereo. Play music that reflects the mood you’re looking to create. Decorating with heavy curtains, installing carpet, and adding upholstered furniture can help dampen the loud din outside and create solitude inside.
THE PROBLEM: The town is reconstructing all the sidewalks and nearby roadways.
THE OPPORTUNITY: Construction cones, torn-up walkways and men jackhammering are a massive deterrent to potential customers. In many situations, they’d rather go without a something than walk through a construction zone. If you can’t get people to come to your brick-and-mortar store, Clover Online helps you build a digital store that’s available right at shoppers’ fingertips as they sit in the comfort of their own homes. Once the construction is complete, utilize Promos, a free app from the Clover App Market, and social media to entice repeat shoppers back to your physical location.
THE PROBLEM: Your store windows are small, limiting the size of display you can create.
THE OPPORTUNITY: Creating a whimsical, humorous, or thought-provoking window display is a great way to draw people through your doors. If your windows don’t provide the opportunity for consumers to window shop, reach out to other nearby business owners and see if you can work out a cross-promotion. Inquire about using a portion or one of their windows in exchange for promotion of their business on your social media channels or even the ability to sell a small selection of items in your retail location.
Undoubtedly, location woes can be frustrating business deterrents. But with some thoughtful, creative solutions, you can actually flip these nuisances on their heads and turn them into new business drivers.

news_206,news,How Clover Online can help any merchant raise their return policy game,"For many small businesses, the idea of a generous return policy can seem nerve-wracking when it comes to their bottom line. But a generous return policy can boost trust and purchase frequency. How to implement one with Clover Online.…",06-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/how-clover-online-can-help-any-merchant-raise-their-return-policy-game/,"For many small businesses, the idea of a generous return policy can seem nerve-wracking when it comes to their bottom line. Whether it’s the idea that unscrupulous customers will take advantage of it via the storied “loan” from a store (buying something, using it, and bringing it back), or the idea that too many returns will wreak havoc on your cash flow reporting, many SMBs traditionally have stuck to more conservative return policies in the past.
Why a clear return policy is a must for ecommerce
But today, that’s slowly changing. With the advent of the internet and ecommerce, a good return policy has become a must-have for many customers who shop online.
And the reasons are obvious: unlike an in-store experience where shoppers get to view, touch, and try on a product, shopping online doesn’t offer access to those decision variables. That means trusting the ecommerce retailer to do right by customers if there’s something off about a shopper’s purchase is imperative to building trust in an online brand.
Take Zappos for example. The online shoe retailer opened in 1999 with a generous return policy and doubled sales every year for at least their first eight years. In year 10 they sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion. And the craziest thing about it? Zappos found out that their most valuable customers where those who returned half their orders.
What brick-and-mortars have learned about returns from the web
But it’s not just online retailers that have seen success with generous return policies. Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Nordstrom and LL Bean have grown excellent reputations and loyal customer bases by offering liberal return policies.
Whether in-store, or online, the aforementioned companies have found that a generous return policy does two things:

A generous return policy creates trust. Trust is a crucial element to any business transaction. Many people experience purchase anxiety—especially on more expensive items. But a generous return policy shows customers that you stand by your products and services, diminishing those fears of buyer’s remorse that many customers experience.
A generous return policy boosts purchase frequency. Second, a liberal return policy encourages buyers to purchase more things more often. Like the Zappos example above, a good return policy encourages shoppers to spend with you more readily—because they know that if something doesn’t fit or isn’t right, a return is no problem. This kind of great service encourages brand loyalty, and encourages shoppers to return to your store to make another purchase another time because of a smooth return process.

With Clover Online, an easy-to-manage return capability for every small business
While there are certainly costs associated with a generous return policy, many retailers have found these kinds of return policies to be a net positive when it comes to sales and customer loyalty.
But those costs are also exceptionally manageable for SMBs, thanks to today’s integrated, customizable point-of-sale systems.
With Clover Online, for example, managing returns is a cinch. All you have to do is answer a few questions, and your return policy is automatically generated and added to your website. It’s as simple as selecting drop-downs in a short form: Clover Online will do the rest.
With Clover Online, answer a few questions from a dropdown menu…
…and get an auto-generated return policy.
Whether you do business online or in-store, or both, if you’re looking to build trust, loyalty, and sales, then adding a stellar return policy is the way for your business to stand head and shoulders above the crowd and create a valuable, loyal customer base that can drive your business for years to come.
With multi-million dollar companies like Zappos, Nordstrom, and LL Bean doing the same, it’s certainly worth considering.

news_207,news,5 questions to ask to create a striking window display,"The challenge: Creating a visually engaging window display that draws passersby with their eyes on their smartphone. Ask yourself these five questions to determine whether your scene is passes muster.
…",06-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-create-striking-window-display/,"This post is part of our 5 Questions series, helping merchants ask the right questions before making key business decisions. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
In today’s digital age, attracting customers to step through your doors is harder than ever. Year-over-year foot traffic to brick-and-mortar stores has declined 48 straight months, according to data analytics firm RetailNext.
All signs point towards e-commerce sales remaining strong, so it’s important to put even more effort in drawing shoppers inside your storefront. What better way to do that than to create an eye-catching window display?
Here are five questions to ask in order to make your behind-the-glass presentation pop.
1. What story do you want to tell?
Many retailers decorate their windows to correspond directly to the season or a holiday. In other words, they’ll only feature red clothing for Valentine’s Day and put up a lit evergreen for Christmas. But smart business owners avoid a simplistic design like this.
To stand out from your retail neighbors, choose a theme. Think: “The dog days of summer,” “A Hawaiian Luau,” or “Beat the heat” during summer months. During autumn and winter, consider “Falling for you,” “Inside the snow globe,” or “Auld Lang Syne.” Combine products from your store with inexpensive objects you might have lying around to create an engaging visual scene.
2. On what level should items be placed?
There are adult shoppers and kid shoppers, tall ones and short ones. Ideally, your windows will have something for everyone, so decorate from floor to ceiling. Create a focal point by placing the majority of items at eye level of the average adult. (Keep in mind that eye level when someone is standing outside might not be the same as eye level inside; some windows are raised.) If you sell children’s items, place them near ground level. If you don’t, decorate with items that kids will find intriguing. Finally, don’t forget to hang something from the top of your window display.
3. How long will the display remain up?
Creating a window scene is a lot of work, but customers do not want to see the same decorations over and over and over again. Switching things up keeps your storefront exciting, especially for repeat clients. If you own a business that customers frequent often, like a café or coffee shop, make a small tweak to your visual display—add an item, take something away, move a product to a different spot in the tableau—every couple of days so it doesn’t get stale. For businesses that have a clientele that only visits every few weeks, be sure to freshen your windows on a similar schedule.
4. Will the window look good if photographed for social media?
You want your window display to be ready for its Snapchat or Instagram close-up. After all, it’s free advertising when people post photos of your scene on their feed. Experts suggest installing lighting that matches the rest of your business—using similar color lighting connects the display and the interior to create a cohesive look. (Lighting that contrasts will be jarring and will induce a feeling of disconnectedness.) The use of tabletop lamps and Christmas lights can help create a cozy feeling as well.
5. How much product is too much?
You want your window to look polished, not haphazard or cluttered. Stores shouldn’t feature their entire inventory in a display. Customers won’t know what to focus on if there’s too many items crammed into the small space. Instead, showcase just a few items at eye level, along with some smart signage—giving shoppers just enough of a glimpse that they want to walk through the door.

news_208,news,The secret to happier employees,"“Your employees are your greatest asset,” is a phrase probably everyone in business has heard. Happy employees mean higher retention, increased efficiency, and happier customers. Read on for some ideas on how to keep your team happy.
…",10-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/secret-happier-employees/,"“Your employees are your greatest asset,” is a phrase probably everyone in business has heard. Happy employees mean higher retention, increased efficiency, and happier customers. Happy employees are also good for managers and owners, because it means less time spent recruiting replacements, better customer service, and thus more repeat customers.
So the benefits for improving employee morale are obvious. But how does one go about it?
1. Offer flexible schedules.
Over two thirds of all service-industry employees are under 35 years old, where 3 out 10 fall into the 19-26 age bracket. In many cases, they’re students, balancing not only a job, but also class, homework, and extracurricular activities.
The good news is that with employee scheduling software like Homebase, offering flexible scheduling doesn’t have to add to your workload as a manager. Employees can proactively publish their availabilities so you’ll have them at your fingertips as you’re building the schedule and, if something comes up after the schedule has already been published, they can trade shifts in the mobile app (with your approval).
2. Try to be predictable and consistent.
Recently, The NY Times profiled a 22-year old employee struggling to provide childcare while balancing an ever-changing work schedule. She reported that she rarely learned her schedule more than 3 days before the start of a workweek—too late to find a babysitter (and tough to find a consistent babysitter generally, since they were searching for predictable work themselves).
A lot of businesses still using paper or spreadsheets publish the schedule once a week, often on Sundays. For people who sometimes work on Monday, that means if there’s a change in their hours, they don’t have any time to prepare. It also makes it difficult to predict income, which leads to an overall sense of anxiety.
By using scheduling software like Homebase, you can publish and revise schedules as necessary, and your employees will get updates (along with shift reminders), so they’ll know well in advance when they’re scheduled to work next. One business owner in Portland we talked to now publishes employee schedules three weeks in advance, and her team loves it.
3. Offer training and opportunities for advancement.
Providing training and the ability to employees to gain skills can be greatly improve their contentment (and productivity) within their work. You might consider allowing employees to cross-train in other departments, which will also save you on labor costs during slow periods. Additionally, consider paying for relevant seminars or classes, even if it’s something as simple as CPR training or food safety certification (which is also a win-win for your business).
4. Reward results.
Of course, money drives employee happiness, so make sure you reward your star employees. Results that go unnoticed can be very deflating to employees and makes them feel undervalued. Look at ways to keep track of employees that consistently perform and reward appropriately. Your employees will appreciate the recognition and feel inspired to continue their efforts.
An easy way to start—reward your employees who consistently show up on time. They’re team players, and they’re helping keep your overtime costs down.
If you track sales closely, consider an incentive for your star salespeople. One retail owner we talked to in Decatur, GA sets a sales target for each week, and offers bonuses to the team once they exceed that goal. It’s a great idea because the team wins when the business wins, so everyone’s incentives are perfectly aligned.
5. Communicate clearly and often.
Communication is fundamental to any relationship, but it’s particularly important in the workplace. Celebrate your team when things go well, and be clear when they don’t meet your expectations with instructions on how they can do better next time. Frame the conversation as a learning opportunity for lifelong skills they’ll need throughout their careers, rather than something particular to this job. Everyone wants to know how they’re doing, what they’re really good at and how they can be better.

Keeping track of all the latest technological tricks that can help you get important jobs done may fall to the bottom of your to-do list.
That’s why we regularly bring you updates on what’s new and exciting in the Clover App Market—the latest apps that help you manage your business better. Here are a few of the latest offerings you might consider trying.
JobPose
For hospitality and retail businesses, staffing can be a constant challenge. Turnover tends to be high, and particularly for small businesses, sifting through applications and interviewing candidates can take a lot of time away from actually running your business.
JobPose saves you time and money by allowing you to post to multiple job boards at once for one low fee (discounted for Clover merchants!). Instead of paying $75, $100, or even more per posting, you pay one monthly fee to maintain your profile and post all available jobs on Craigslist, ZipRecruiter, local college job boards, social media, and more.
With JobPose, you can create a profile for your business and post job descriptions in the app. An algorithm will help surface the best applicants for your business, and you can search through candidates’ profiles, which will include a photo as well as information about their experience. You can add interview questions to your job posting, to help you weed out unsuitable candidates quickly, and you can schedule interviews right in the app as well.
Kitchen Display
Kitchen Display is a great way to instantaneously send orders from a Clover terminal to the kitchen. It can integrate with the Tables or Registers apps so your servers can log food orders, and the orders will automatically be sent directly to the kitchen for processing. The app is even available at two different price points, one for quick-service restaurants, and another for full-service restaurants.
The display is simple and easy to use. Servers can touch individual food items and add them to an order. The entire order appears automatically in the kitchen’s display—and the display also highlights the time the order was placed, so the kitchen knows which orders to process first.
The time display also serves as an early-warning system for potential customer issues, letting the whole team see when an order is taking too long. It’s an easy, customizable solution that will help you deliver top-notch customer service.
Clover Flex
It may not be a new app, but the Clover Flex is an important development to share. This handheld terminal is a great new option for Clover merchants. It boasts a 5-inch touchscreen display and fits easily in the palm of your hand or in a server’s apron pocket. It’s a great option for food trucks, salons, service-based businesses that make house calls, or for selling at events or when you’re on the go. You can use it to close customers out at their tables or while they’re waiting in line. You can also use it for inventory management, scanning items on the floor, or in the stockroom.
Clover Flex comes with a built-in receipt printer, camera, QR scanner, and barcode scanner. It can take swipe or chip cards with a PIN or a signature. Signatures will be captured and uploaded to your Clover system to help prevent chargebacks later. You can use it over 3G to process orders on the go, or, if your Flex is running on the same WiFi network as your other Clover terminals, orders will sync automatically with your system.

The long, warm days of summer invite celebrations and outdoor events. Why not add a company outing to the season’s lineup?
Get-togethers are great for helping people focus on what the business is all about, commit their efforts, and connect with one another. While big companies might opt for elaborate picnics or retreats at resort hotels, any off-site gathering can be valuable and doable.
By scaling down or adapting ideas used by larger enterprises, even the smallest team can reap the benefits—no planning divisions or deep pockets required. Here are some ideas to get the ball moving.
Think beyond the picnic.
There’s nothing wrong with a tried and true picnic in a nice park. Survey employees to see if that’s what they want. If so, consider spicing up the event with catered food, a friendly sports game, or team-building activities. Hundreds can be found online, including this epic list of great team-building games.
If a picnic sounds boring or buggy, consider taking the gang out for bowling or miniature golf, a meal at a nice restaurant, or a scavenger hunt in your city. Throw a party at your business after hours. Creating fun and camaraderie doesn’t have to be difficult.
Get away from it all, even on a shoestring budget.
It’s easy to dismiss the overnight option as too much trouble and expense. But services such as Airbnb can dramatically reduce the cost of accommodations. Entrepreneurs surveyed by Inc. magazine suggest renting a house in a nearby rustic area, easily accessible by car. Assigning people to shopping, cooking, and cleaning duties can cut expenses even further.
Don’t forget to balance fun with work. “If people only had fun, they’ll talk about it, but it won’t have a lasting impact on your company. And if they only did work, they’ll think the retreat was a waste of a trip,” advises Brandon Bruce, a software company co-founder.
Tour competing establishments.
For the perfect melding of business and pleasure, consider taking employees out for a tasting tour of the competition, whether frozen yogurt shops or Thai restaurants or bars. Place small orders at each, evaluating the fare, taking in the ambience, and checking out the service. Bring back three ideas for making improvements at your own place of business.
Do group volunteer gigs—and capture millennial hearts.
As a variation on an old saying, the team that volunteers together, stays together. By chipping in to help a worthy cause, employees forge bonds while rallying around a mission—especially important to millennials, who are more likely to stay with businesses that align with their values.
In fact, “doing good” is baked into young people’s DNA. The 2016 Millennial Impact Report found that 46% had volunteered for a social cause and 52% had donated to a cause in the past month alone! Tap that charitable spirit, and small business owners will gain their commitment as well.
Focus on the positive.
What does the business or brand stand for? What core values permeate the workplace? Caring, trust, quality, or just adding joy to people’s lives? Turn those ideals into the theme of your retreat or get-together.
Alternatively, small business owners can use the event to highlight their gratitude to a hard-working team. For part-timers in particular, being recognized for excellent work—most punctual, highest accuracy rate—can mean a great deal. Well-considered gifts make nice tokens of thanks, while signaling which behaviors are most important to the business.
Whether it’s a meal out, a fun activity, or an overnight retreat, make summer a time to remember for the whole gang.

news_211,news,Team leadership: Managing an employee who is also a friend,"It’s not easy to mix business and friendship—but it is possible. As long as you’re willing to have some honest conversations, you can manage a friend without destroying your friendship.…",13-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/team-leadership-managing-employee-also-friend/,"This post is part of our Staffing & Human Resources series. Explore more better business tips and tactics here on the Clover blog.
Can business and friendship ever mix? Famous stories of friendships ruined by a business relationship, like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak’s, may make it seem like any friendship that gets mixed up with the hard work and high stakes of building a business is doomed to fail. Friendship is particularly tough when you’re the boss—it’s not easy to tell a good friend you need that report by Thursday.
But maintaining a friendship with an employee is entirely possible, as long as you’re prepared to have some honest conversations. Here are 5 ways to effectively manage an employee who is also a friend:
1. Define responsibilities clearly.
Especially when a business is just starting up, it’s easy to take an ‘all hands on deck’ attitude, and just let whoever’s around handle whatever comes up. But when you’re managing a friend, you want their responsibilities—and your expectations—to be crystal-clear from the beginning. Make sure they know what’s on their to-do list, and make sure other employees understand where those lines are, too. Being clear from the start can help avoid some awkward conversations later.
2. Avoid even the appearance of favoritism.
If you and your friend walk into the office every Monday morning chatting about the awesome time you had on Saturday night, other employees are going to be jealous. That doesn’t mean you have to hide your friendship, but it does mean you have to be extra-careful to make sure there’s no question that you’re treating everyone fairly. Don’t let your friend slide on something you’d discipline another employee for. Don’t give your friend the best assignment if it’s not in their job description. Try to take other employees’ feelings into account—you don’t want your friend to end up feeling isolated in the office.
3. Communicate clearly about boundaries.
It’d be easy to let yourself vent to your friend about anything and everything that comes up. Make sure you’re clear about topics that are off-limits to employees, and be honest with your friend if there’s something you can’t share with them. If you’re worried that talking about some behind-the-scenes issues you’re dealing with would put your friend in an awkward situation with colleagues, tell them that.
4. Make time for your friendship outside of work.
Working with a friend means you see them all the time—but time spent together at work should be different from time spent hanging out as friends. Don’t let working together substitute for spending time together as friends. Try to maintain some separation between the two relationships. Don’t talk too much about work when you’re hanging out outside the office, and don’t let personal stuff take over too much of your work time. Navigating that work relationship will be easier if you’re deliberate about investing time in your friendship when you’re not in the office.
5. Talk about it!
Check in regularly to make sure you’re both feeling comfortable with both sides of your relationship, particularly when you’re just starting out. You may even want to have work check-ins at the office, and friendship check-ins outside of it, to make sure you’re addressing any issues that may come up. You will find the right balance as long as you both stay honest about how you’re feeling.
Becoming the boss doesn’t have to turn you into Michael Scott from The Office. You can maintain a friendship with an employee as long as you’re willing to put in some work on honest communication.

Every business should have three to six months’ emergency cash, or more if it’s a seasonal business. Consider making automatic investments to make this easier. If you only need $5,000 to stay afloat every month, automatically dump your extra revenue into a savings account until you have a suitable cash reserve. Alternately, try to run the business without taking into account the extra money this customer brings in. Part of becoming reliant on a customer is operating as if you’ll always have them.
2. Create a contingency plan.
Don’t wait for a problem to arise—come up with a plan of how you would handle a sudden loss of your most profitable customer. Make short-term plans, such as a flash sale, and longer-term plans like building up clients and customers to replace any lost business. Do an analysis on what promotions in the past have brought in the most net cash.
3. Target similar customers.
Using Clover Insights, a free data analysis app, analyze your star customer’s spending habits to figure out how to find more customers like them. Are your best customers single women 18-35, or senior citizens looking for a deal? Are they parents with small children, business executives, or “early adopters”—people looking for the hottest trends? Once you have a clear picture of the demographics of your ideal or most valuable customers, consider how you can market to them or perhaps get them to purchase more. You might be able to use your current big spender as an anonymous use-case example when talking to other customers: “You know, I have a customer who loves these scones so much he buys them for the entire office once a week.” “Are you sure you don’t want to try the spa day? One of our customers loved it so much she gave it away as bridal party gifts to her attendants.”
4. Leverage the relationship.
There are many ways you can use the big spender to increase business. If, for example, you’re doing a lot of catering to a department at a local university, perhaps they can introduce you to other departments. Perhaps they would be willing to give you a positive review on Yelp! or other business sites. Maybe you can get a testimonial from them you can include in your marketing. If you’re uncomfortable asking your customer directly, consider cold-calling similar businesses. For example, if you’re a food business, ask the operator who manages catering for the company and call them. “This is Sarah from Coffee Break. I’m calling because we do a lot of business in your building. In fact, we are there every Wednesday to cater a weekly business meeting. We’d love to extend you an introductory offer of free delivery on Wednesdays for the next month if you’d like to give our services a try. Are there meetings you typically cater?”
5. Manage the workflow.
Beware the time sink that surrounds big-time clients. It’s natural to want to keep big customers happy. That doesn’t mean you, as the owner, should spend all your time servicing that customer. Start to train lower-level staff to manage the needs of this customer at the level of quality needed. Not only will this free you up to scout for new business, but it reduces the costs of keeping this customer, which helps you build up cash reserves.
6. Stay relevant.
Another way to reduce risk is to embrace the relationship and look for ways to make yourself more indispensable to the customer. Ask them questions like: I’d love to figure out a way to become a preferred vendor for you—what kinds of problems can I help you solve? Who do you use now for catering parties and meetings? Would you ever consider using us for [a new product/service]? What would prevent you from choosing us for other services like stocking break rooms with fresh coffee in the morning?
7. Reconnect with your other customers.
Clover Insights can help you identify other (relatively) big spenders in your store. You can uncover trends in what they buy, and when. Consider what would be attractive to these customers and run a promotion to entice them back into the store. Clover’s Promo app can help you construct a “win-back” campaign to engage older customers who haven’t shopped with you in a while. Think about what you might be able to offer these customers, as a loyalty program, to turn them into regulars. (For ideas on loyalty programs, check out 3 things to consider when structuring your loyalty program and Overhauling your loyalty programs: beyond freebies.)
Periodically evaluate whether your business is diversified enough. Preferably no single customer or client represents more than 10 percent of your income—if they do, start thinking of ways to limit risk. Also take a look at whether you’re overly reliant on a particular industry or type of customer such as tourists or university students. If so, consider ways to attract different types of customers.
Diversity your business. Clover can help. Check out our promotion and data insights apps in the Clover App Market.

news_215,news,What makes a business Yelp page effective?,Few things are more important than your business's reputation. Your Yelp profile can go a long way towards shaping how your business is viewed by customers. Read on for a list of practical tips to help you put your best foot forward.…,21-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/makes-businesss-yelp-page-effective/,"You understand that few things are more important than your business’s reputation. Your Yelp profile can be one of the most important digital profiles there is when it comes to shaping how your business is viewed by current and future customers. That means it isn’t an environment you can set and forget, much less ignore altogether.
Putting your best foot forward on Yelp hinges on taking control of your profile and actively managing it. Just like Google, Yelp uses an algorithm that takes a number of factors into account when determining how high a business ranks within the site. Read on for a list of practical tips to help you do just that.
Tell them what they need to know.
Make sure your most basic and important business information is up-to-date: hours of operation, street address, and phone number. Don’t forget to update your Yelp page on national holidays and other days you will be closed or have business hours that are different than normal.
Call out your unique value proposition.
Customers like to know what makes your company special—why you started the business and what sets you apart from your competitors. Find a way to say it simply and make sure it’s prominently displayed. No need to be precious (unless that’s part of your brand). Just be honest and sincere.
Add great photos.
Make sure the images show your products, customers engaging with your products, and your employees serving your customers. These little slices of life help paint a more complete picture of who you are and what customers can expect. Do your best to take quality photos. We like this primer from Gizmodo about how to take good photos with your cell phone.
Include a full list of your products and services.
You never know when you can benefit from a customer having a craving for something you carry. In this respect, more is more when it comes to creating your Yelp profile. To get the most out of Yelp’s algorithm, place your core products and services within the first sentence of the “Specialties” section to ensure that when people search for products, services and menu items you offer, your business shows up.
Link to your website.
Even though we suggest adding a full list of products and services, Yelp isn’t designed to be an end-all, be-all repository of knowledge about your company. Hopefully you have a cleanly designed site you can link to so that curious customers can learn more if they want. (Clover Online provides a simple way to create and maintain a professional and attractive web presence.)
Respond to positive reviews.
We’re not saying you have to respond to all of them, but choose some of the best and interact. It allows your personality to shine through and shows that you’re actively engaged with your customers.
Show appreciation when someone gives you fulsome praise and/or a 4- or 5-star review. Let customers know how grateful you are for both their business and their positive review—and that you strive to deliver that same level of excellence to every customer you have.
Respond to negative reviews, too.
This might not seem like your idea of fun, but you should also read and respond to negative reviews. Why? It shows you care about customers’ experience, and it shows your commitment to bettering your business. Here are a couple of specific steps you should follow when dealing with negative reviews. You can find more detail about how to implement each suggestion here.

Determine the review’s accuracy. Focus on the facts and remember there are two sides to every story.
Keep your cool. As tempting as it might be, never argue with the customer. Instead, try to regain their respect by explaining what went wrong, and how you’re going to fix the issue.
Use your normal customer service policy. If you were wrong, say so. And then tell them the steps you’re going to take to make it right.
Compensate where appropriate. Offer them an incentive to come back, like a free meal, a discount, or an invite to a special event.
Stop future problems before they start. By using a tool like  Clover Rewards, you can receive feedback privately from customers before their experience mushrooms into a big public complaint session.
Get some good news out there. Don’t be afraid to remind customers that you have a Yelp page. People love to share their positive experiences, and they’re just what you need to offset any negative reviews. And remember, it’s not acceptable to pay for reviews. Not only is that morally wrong, it’s also against Yelp’s policy.

Be diligent about following these suggestions to help you mold a great Yelp profile that has your business ready for (digital) primetime.

news_216,news,Growing pains: Learning to delegate to managers,"Short of cloning yourself, finding a manager you can trust—and then actually trusting them to do their work—is the best way to ensure your company’s success. If you’re having trouble letting go of the reins, here are some key steps you can take to delegate to your managers. …",24-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-learning-delegate-managers/,"Your business is your baby, and much like leaving your child with a babysitter for the first time, delegating to a manager can feel scary. However, working with a manager is a critical step for growing your business. Short of cloning yourself, finding someone you can trust—and then actually trusting them to do their work—is the best way to ensure your company’s success.
In the past, we’ve covered tips and strategies for finding and hiring the right manager. Now that you’ve found that person, it’s time to let them do the amazing work for which you hired them. If you’re having trouble letting go of the reins, here are some key steps you can take to trust in and delegate to your managers.
Assess your to-do list.
Start by zooming out and seeing the big picture. Make lists of tasks and responsibilities that fall on your plate each day. Mark those which could be accomplished by others. Of course, some of those tasks you might enjoy doing; earmark one or two of those for yourself. Similarly, identify which tasks are difficult for you, and consider which staff members have the necessary talent to take those off your hands. Try to be as honest with yourself as possible.
Start as a team.
The best leaders delegate by working with their managers, rather than just telling them what to do. Ask your manager to identify their strengths and interests as they relate to your business. Then, ask your manager for input on how they think certain aspects of the business can be improved. Starting with buy-in from your manager helps that manager be committed to the results and aligned with your business goals. The more excited they feel about their work, the better the outcome will be.
Ask for feedback.
Often, the hardest part of delegating is the feeling that you could do the task faster and better yourself in the time it takes to teach an employee or manager to do it. A manager might make some mistakes the first time. But, it’s all part of the learning process. It’s nobody’s fault if things don’t flow perfectly at first effort. Be open to listening to their ideas along the way. Stay constructive with your manager, explain what you’ve learned that requires a fix, and move on.
Delegating and trusting your manager with important parts of your business should create a mutual respect for you and your managers. If you don’t give room for managers to show leadership and innovation, you’ll never see their full potential. Create a culture where regular feedback on both sides is expected and appreciated, keeping an eye on sustainably growth benchmarks for your business. Schedule frequent meetings to check in on new tasks or responsibilities, and be open to constructive criticism.
Bottom line? Give your managers the tools and authority they deserve to be successful. Listen to what they have to say in terms of what they need, and trust that they will stay aligned with the principles and practices you’ve laid as groundwork. Trusting others with your child—er, business—will help you separate your identity from that of your product, and free your company to grow to new heights!

news_217,news,Business accelerators: Sponsoring a community event,"Sponsoring events is a unique way to get exposure for your business, foster goodwill with your community, and partner with other businesses nearby. Here are some great tips on getting the most out of a sponsorship.
…",25-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-sponsoring-community-event/,"Sponsoring events is a unique way to get exposure for your business and foster goodwill within your community. At events you can partner with other nearby businesses to reach new audiences. You could sponsor existing events, or create your own. But before you jump in, make sure sponsoring an event fits in with your goals.
Go to the Right Event
Here are a few questions to determine whether an event is worth sponsoring:

Will my target market be at this event? People who attend an event are, in many ways, a captive audience, and treats from sponsors can be a great way to make a positive impression. Sponsorships work best when the people in attendance are the primary audience you’re trying to attract. Are they the right demographic? Do they have the discretionary funds to purchase your product? Will sponsoring this event gain their goodwill? The answers to these questions will help you determine whether this is a good investment.
Will my business get noticed if I sponsor it? Carefully consider what the sponsorship entails, what you get for the money, and whether that will mean anything to your target market. If the sponsorship gets your logo on a giveaway, is it something that attendees are likely to keep, or just throw away after consuming? Will there be a lot of competition for their attention, or are you one of only a few sponsors? Sometimes it’s better to buy the biggest sponsorship at a small event than to try to compete with much larger brands at a huge event.
Does it fit in with my brand? NASCAR is extremely popular, but if you’re selling bicycles it’s probably not the right event for you. If your business sells sustainable, locally-farmed, organic foods, an event supporting local farms is a good fit. The same business supporting a competitive food contest such as the Nathan’s hot dog contest would be an odd choice. Similarly, does the event promote social causes and charities your business supports? Or does sponsoring it send a mixed message to customers?
Do I have a clear goal to define success at this event? Any marketing promotion you do should have very clear goals. Strive to achieve more than just getting mentioned in announcements or ads in written programs. Perhaps you can host trying new flavors of a tasty treat where people review the new flavors on Yelp! Or consider handing out coupons at the event that expire within 3 weeks and see how many get used. Just make sure you have a goal that can be measured.

Once you determine which event is right for you, it’s time to consider what kind of sponsorship you’re interested in.
Make the Offer Count
There are many ways to get involved at an event. Here are just a few ideas to get started.

Offer free product samples. Whether it’s catering a town hall meeting, or providing a post-10K race snack, food almost always works as a giveaway at events. But there are other ways to give a free product or service. If you’re a spa, you could offer a free 5 minute shoulder rub, or a quick nail polish refresh. Hair salons can offer a free blow out or updo to the first 50 customers. A martial arts dojo can offer a free 20-minute introduction to self-defense. Be creative.
Offer your space. Event coordinators will push for donations and monetary contributions, but that’s not the only way to support groups of people. There are many worthy causes that need meeting space. If you have the room, consider opening special hours to give them the opportunity to use the space or offer free services during normal hours to your target audience. Looking to help out veterans? Consider free haircuts to servicemen and women on Sunday mornings. Want to support cancer survivors? Host a support group in your place of business after hours to help them meet in a relaxing, non-medical environment.
Offer your time. There’s no better way to get involved in the community than to offer your time. Try volunteering as a group to a local food bank, shelter, or other community resource to build team spirit in your organization. Perka, the creator of Clover Rewards, has a Perka Cares initiative. Last year on September 13, the Day of Service, they partnered with Gyft and Clover to send a team of volunteers to a Second Harvest Food Bank in San Jose. More than 30 team members volunteered to help out. As Alexander Wilmerding, VP of Support & Operations, at Perka said, “Perka’s continued involvement in our community strengthens our brand and what we value as a company.” Give back as a team—you’ll grow stronger.

Get the Most Out of the Experience
Now that you’ve decided where you want to participate and what you’ll offer, here are some quick tips to get the most out of your sponsorship:

Don’t be afraid to negotiate. Most sponsorship packages are flexible, and event coordinators are often willing to negotiate details to give you more for your money.
Bring your colleagues and invite your best customers. Donating food or drinks is nice, but being there in person to engage with the people at the event has far more impact, especially if there is a group of you.
Give a memorable, meaningful experience. You’re there to get exposure for your business, so give some thought to what would leave a positive impression. Personalize the giveaways or coupons to tie them thematically to the event.
Wear branded outfits. Make sure you and your crew wear the uniform or something with your logo, so everywhere you walk within the event you are marketing your business.
Play it up on social media. Don’t forget to plug your appearance in your social media channels and to post images of your team at the event. If it’s a charitable event, ask if you can post photos or videos of the recipients to post online.
Bring coupons. If your goal is to bring in new customers, this is the perfect opportunity to entice them to come to your store. Make the offer something unique to the event, and encourage the coupon holder to bring a second person: “Bring a friend—offer is good for two.”
Give away swag. If you have marketing swag, or tchotchkes featuring your logo, bring it with you to give away.

When you’re at the event, don’t forget to market to other sponsors. People working the sponsor booths are potential customers as well. Plus they might be interested in partnering with you to co-market your businesses going forward.

news_218,news,Top 5 employee scheduling frustrations,"Scheduling your team can be a headache for everyone. But by switching to free scheduling software like Homebase, you can make things easier for both managers and employees.  
…",26-07-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/top-5-employee-scheduling-frustrations/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. Read more employee management posts from Homebase and other Staffing & Human Resources articles here on the Clover blog.
Scheduling your team can be a headache for everyone—for the managers that spend hours trying to put the scheduling puzzle together every week and for the employees who don’t always end up with the schedule they want. But software can help! By switching to free scheduling software like Homebase, you can make things easier for both managers and employees.
Here are five of the most common scheduling frustrations we’ve heard from employees, and what you can do to address them.
1. Not knowing who they’re working with.
In a small operation with just a few people working at a given time, knowing who you’re working with can make a big difference. While most business owners would prefer that everyone on their team works well with everyone else, this isn’t usually the case. Providing some advanced notice to your team about who else is working their shift can go a long way to keeping your team happy and productive.
2. Not receiving the schedule far enough in advance.
A lot of businesses still using written schedules typically update them once a week, frequently on the weekends or during a slow period. But for employees in businesses where their hours may change week-to-week, this can be stressful. Let’s say you publish your week’s schedule on Sunday. It’d be great to let employees that are working Monday know more than a day in advance, or at least send them a notification the minute the schedule is published.
One option: schedule several weeks in advance. We talked to one restaurateur in Portland who schedules her taco shop employees three weeks in advance. If something last-minute comes up for her team, they can easily trade shifts.
3. Not getting the time off they requested.
We’ve heard from employees who write down time-off requests on sticky notes quickly forgotten to managers who just can’t give everyone the time off that they’d like, especially around major events like music festivals.
The good news is that team management software like Homebase can help. By moving the process of tracking and requesting time off online, it’s both easier and more equitable for your team. Employees will be able to request time off on their phones via the free mobile app as soon as they know they’ll need it, and your manager will have all the information in one place when they’re making the schedule. What’s more, you can set some limits, like a minimum advanced notice, or block off certain days when you can’t grant any time off requests.
4. Inconsistent hours week to week.
People love predictability (and the manager at your business responsible for scheduling everyone probably feels exactly the same way!), so if you’re able to offer set hours to your team members, try it. Everyone depends on the money, and knowing in advance how much they’ll be making next week is really helpful. And with the Homebase mobile app, they’ll also be able to see their estimated earnings for each shift.
5. Last-minute scheduling changes
A common complaint we’ve heard about is last-minute (and mid-week) schedule changes. Sometimes these are unavoidable, like if an employee gets sick, but you can minimize them with a little help from some data.
What’s more, we’ve found that people are generally happy getting hours added to their schedule, but because they’re counting on the money, don’t like getting cut from the schedule.
With Homebase employee scheduling, you’ll see sales estimates by day pulled right from your Clover device when you’re scheduling, alongside wage and weather information, so you’ll know exactly how much you’ll be spending—and how much you’ll likely earn. This should make your labor needs and, in turn, your employees’ work lives, a little more predictable .
In the end, it’s really a win-win. By reducing scheduling headaches for your employees, you’ll have a more dedicated and loyal team—and you’ll probably save a few hours building out the weekly schedule to boot.

This is music to merchants’ ears, who love bringing customers to their physical location. That’s because foot traffic is essential to a small business owner’s bottom line. When fewer people come through the doors, businesses feel the pinch—often, very quickly.
Retail traffic has declined 10.56 percent year over year from July 2016 to July 2017, according to a Cowen and Company equity research report. Here are several common reasons for slowing foot traffic and how small business owners can overcome them.

What’s causing the traffic decline: The sales cycle is full of ups and downs, but seasonality seems to be having a bigger impact this year. The slow times feel slower than usual.
The remedy: Having detailed knowledge of how your business is performing is absolutely essential when trying to gauge if a seasonal slowdown is atypical of ones in the past. But what small business owner has time to sift through spreadsheets of sales figures or dig through old computer files looking for charts to compare? Clover Insights, a free app, does all the work, revealing important daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly sales trends. Armed with this knowledge, business owners can compare patterns from year to year and plan in advance to head off any downturns in sales.
What’s causing the traffic decline: VIP customers aren’t popping in as frequently as they used to.
The remedy: Every business is reliant on their regulars to carry them through slow times. If a merchant thinks that they’re only coming irregularly (or spending less than they typically do), Clover Insights provides buying pattern data that she needs to confirm her hunch. The app can further segment these VIPs so you have a better idea who they are (the number of times they’re now visiting, their buying habits) and can market to them more effectively. For instance, are they avoiding your “classic” products and only purchasing trendier items? Reward them with an exclusive offering during their next visit.
What’s causing the traffic decline: Mother Nature is wreaking havoc on your sales.
The remedy: Owners of car service businesses love it when it rains. In contrast, freezing temperatures may keep ice cream cold, but they also keep customers away from ice cream parlors. The free app Thrive (which works on an iPhone) gives business owners the ability to note weather events, holidays, and other things that can have a negative impact on your business, like construction, a road closure or a water main break. Knowing when adverse weather has kept customers home can help you know when to hop on social media or send an offer via email that’s immediately redeemable in an effort to draw out the crowds during a heat wave or a rainy day.
What’s causing the traffic decline: Several businesses immediately surrounding yours have changed and neighborhood dynamics are now different.
The remedy: Numerous factors, including new businesses or attractions nearby, can pull foot traffic away from your location. To get shoppers and diners dropping by your place again, you’ve got to make it a worthwhile detour. Offering everyday deals, like 30 percent off one category of item (shirts at clothing stores, annual plants at a garden center, waxing services at a salon), is a great way to attract customers. For more ideas on how to manage a challenging location, check out Business problem turnaround: Overcoming location woes (without moving).
What’s causing the traffic decline: Nearby merchants appear to be doing stellar business, while your sales continue to slide.
The remedy: As a small business owner, it’s essential to know how you stack up against the opposition. That’s because understanding how your competitors drive business can help you improve your bottom dollar. Check your sales against local businesses in Clover Insights. Are some businesses seemingly slow, but receiving a lot of take-out orders? Does one merchant have a booming online business that you weren’t aware of? Data such as knowing how much the average customer spends or when most of their sales occur can help you develop tactics of your own to fight back.
What’s causing the traffic decline: Your bestsellers are no longer the best, or perhaps aren’t even selling.
The remedy: Shopventory not only pinpoints you what your hot items are, but tracks profit margin by item as well. Know the numerical stats about your top products and strategize on how to increase their sales even more. The free version of the app also keeps detailed record of how many of your bestsellers are in stock (across multiple locations) so that you never run out, disappointing customers. Think that a new product is quickly overtaking an item that’s traditionally been hot or feel like you’ve got several duds on your shelves that are no longer moving? Confirm your suspicions with the app.
What’s causing the traffic decline: Customers aren’t motivated to visit your business.
The remedy: An incentive will give all shoppers and former regulars a time-sensitive reason to walk through your doors. Promos, a free app in the Clover App Market that is available for all models of Clover, does exactly what its name infers: It sends promos in real-time to consumers via text message, email, or the Perka app. It fully integrates with a small business’s social media channels as well, enabling an owner to post a promotion to the various platforms in just one click. To utilize the app even further, subscribe to Customer Feedback Plus and gain the ability to target former regulars and transform them into VIPs once again.

news_220,news,5 questions to ask before upgrading your technology,"As a small business owner, you probably feel like you never have enough time or money, but every business periodically gets to a moment when the cost of waiting to upgrade your technology outweighs the cost of actually making the upgrade. 
…",03-08-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-upgrading-technology/,"As a small business owner, you probably feel like you never have enough time or money. And when you’re overstressed and budgets are tight, the last thing you want to deal with is the expensive and time-consuming process of upgrading your technology. New hardware or software may seem prohibitively expensive, and just doing the research on what products will work best for your needs may seem like it’s going to take more time than you have.
But every business periodically gets to a moment when the cost of waiting to upgrade your technology outweighs the cost of actually making the upgrade. Maybe the time you’d save with a new system will make it worth it, or maybe your business’s needs have changed enough that you can’t keep going with your old system. Whatever the reason for the upgrade, it doesn’t have to be an expensive time-suck–these days, there are plenty of affordable, user-friendly options out there that will provide the solutions you need in a way that will work for you.
Here are 5 questions to ask before you upgrade your technology:
1. How much time could you save?
Do you still have to update your inventory or balance your books manually? You probably already know that there are technological solutions that could save you all that time. But these days there are software solutions for a host of other business problems—for example, the Schedule app in the Clover App Market can automate the process of alerting your employees to schedule changes, managing shift trades and time-off requests, and even reminding your staff to come in shortly before their shifts start. The Commerce Sync app automatically adds your sales to QuickBooks or Xero every day.
If your current system is plagued by bugs, crashes, or slow loading times, an upgrade could also save you valuable time. Think about not only the time you spend dealing with technological glitches, but the time your staff spends—that’s time you’re paying for.
2. Are you compliant with current rules?
As of 2015, merchants have to be able to accept EMV chip-card technology, or they’re liable for fraudulent transactions. If your current POS system can’t accept EMV cards, it’s definitely time for an upgrade (Clover’s POS terminals all accept EMV cards). But the larger point is that changes like this come along all the time. It’s crucial that you stay informed about the current state of the art in security, and make sure that your technology not only complies with regulations, but meets the requirements of credit card companies and the expectations of customers.
With data breaches and hacks on the rise, it’s more important than ever to make sure that the way you’re safeguarding your business’s—and your customers’—information is as secure as possible. If you’re considering an upgrade for security reasons, look for a system that meets today’s standards and regularly updates its security protocols to keep you and your customers protected.
3. Is your business growing?
The most obvious use-case for new technology is the addition of a whole new aspect to your business. For example, if you’ve launched a food truck or started selling products regularly at local street fairs or other events, you’ll need portable POS terminals that your staff can use on the go. The Clover Flex, Mobile, or Go all offer state-of-the-art security and reliability in convenient, handheld devices. If you’re just starting to sell products online, you’ll need a software solution that makes that process secure, such as Clover Online.
You don’t necessarily need a new line of business to make a technology upgrade worthwhile. Simple growth in your core business could make an upgrade necessary. If you’re hiring more staff, for example, scheduling software could reduce headaches for you and your employees. If you’re making more sales, you might want software that can better track your inventory, or gives you better analytics to see what’s working and what isn’t.
4. Did MacGyver build your current system?
This is a common problem for small businesses. You’ve built up your technology systems piece by piece, starting with whatever software was free when you were running this business in your spare time. This kind of jury-rigged system may work fine for a while, but eventually you may find that the different elements don’t work together. When incompatibility starts to create problems for you and your staff, it may be time for an upgrade to a system that fits together seamlessly.
Even if your piece-by-piece system isn’t creating obvious incompatibilities, it may be confusing when you’re training new staff. If your employees have to learn six different software programs just to do their jobs, it may be time to streamline.
5. What will the ROI be on this investment?
If you’re having trouble with your hardware, do some research to determine the cost of repairing your equipment versus replacing it. In some cases, particularly with older computers or terminals, buying a new model may be cheaper than repairing the old one.
If you’re considering some new software, think about its potential benefits. Will it save you time? Factor the hours saved for you or your staff into your analysis of the return you’ll get on this investment. Will this new software improve the service you’re able to offer to customers? Take that into account when considering the up-front cost of an upgrade.
There are plenty of situations that could make a technology upgrade worth the money. The investment could well be worth it–provided you think through the pros and cons ahead of time.

news_221,news,5 marketing tools to boost your restaurant’s visibility,"It’s never been more important to stay up-to-date and in charge of your restaurant's message. Here are four modern marketing tools every restaurant should know and utilize to extend their reach, promote better exposure, and connect to their patrons. 
…",10-08-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-marketing-tools-boost-restaurants-visibility/,"This is a guest post by the team at SimpleOrder.
With the preponderance of social media and restaurant search platforms, it’s never been more important to stay up to date and in charge of your restaurant’s message. However, trying to manage multiple accounts, respond to reviews, and keep up with your most frequent customers can be challenging. Here are four modern marketing tools every restaurant should know and utilize to extend their reach, promote better exposure, and connect to their patrons.
Yext
Search engines have never been more important than they are today for any business, but they are particularly crucial for restaurants since most customers are searching using mobile phones and conversion is often immediate. According to a report from Google, 60 percent of restaurant searches on mobile devices lead to conversions within one hour.
To get your restaurant listed high on search platforms, Yext is just the tool. Customers searching the web for dining options need to find your restaurant, but restaurant managers and owners don’t always have the time to upload all their information across the hundreds of platforms across the web.
Yext manages all of your information across multiple search engines and restaurant search platforms including Google, Google+ Business, Facebook, Yelp, Bing, and more. Yext not only makes sure that all of your information is up-to-date and accurate, it helps your online search optimization—based on keywords related to your business—making it easier for people to find you.
Buffer
If your restaurant has a strong social media presence and manages a variety of social media streams, it might be a good idea to invest in an app like Buffer. Buffer allows restaurants to manage their social media presence more efficiently by being able to post across all channels in one easy to use platform and schedule posts accordingly. Buffer’s content analytics system can direct you to optimal post times for the greatest exposure. You might be doing a great job at Facebook or Instagram, but Buffer can take this even further, connecting directly to twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google+.
Tint
For restaurants that have active social streams and are continuously updating their page with engaging and interesting content, Tint is a beneficial tool. Tint curates all photos and content related to your business by aggregating content throughout the internet that is specifically related to your restaurant’s concept. Tint uses auto-moderation technology to collect the most relevant topics into one library, and makes it easy to reach out to the original publisher to receive permission for photo use. Through the TINT platform, restaurants can download photos and share them across their social media platforms. Analytics tell you how your user generated posts are succeeding so you can monitor your own performance.
Falcon Social
Customer reviews, generated mostly through social media pages, are one of the most important ways your restaurant can communicate with guests and respond effectively to requests or concerns. However, keeping track of reviews across multiple sites can be rather tedious. Falcon Social provides your restaurant a single inbox for all comments and reviews on your social media feeds, so that any feedback can be replied to properly and in a timely manner. What’s more is that Falcon social creates individual profile cards for your customers, so that your restaurant can create custom experiences and target marketing more effectively.

news_224,news,Business trends & research roundup: Real-world analytics,Think big data is just for the big guys? Think again. Check out our monthly roundup of research as we explore real-world ways small business merchants can use big data analytics to run their business better.…,17-08-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-trends-research-roundup-real-world-analytics/,"Think big data is just for the big guys? Think again. Check out our monthly roundup of research as we explore real-world ways small business merchants can use big data analytics to run their business better.
This post will define big data, show you why small businesses are shying away from it, and introduce you to a few compelling reasons why they shouldn’t. More importantly, we’ll tell you just how easy it is to unlock the insights in your current data with a Clover solution.
We hear the term “big data” a lot, but what does it really mean? Simply stated, big data refers to the trend of using insights from your existing sales information to make smarter business decisions. The “big” also refers to size. Data is expected to grow to 40 zettabytes by 2020, or roughly 50-fold growth since 2010. SalesForceIQ
Not only will the amount of data grow exponentially, but its importance to your success will as well. Without a doubt, small businesses don’t rely on big data analytics as much as they should. And why? In looking at responses from a recent Nielsen poll of 2,000 small businesses in the U.S., 41 percent think conducting market research is too costly, and 42 percent say they just don’t have the time. And even more surprisingly, 35 percent went so far as to say they’ve never even considered it. Nielsen.com
However, the numbers also show they tend to overestimate the potential challenges of adopting new technology — with 80% indicating that technological deployment was easier than they anticipated, and 70% responding that technological investments exceeded their expectations. AdAge
With Clover Insights, you get powerful, easy-to-use sales analysis for small business that turns your transaction data into exciting new opportunities to grow. From sales numbers that help you understand the impact of your marketing efforts to trends in what your customers are buying, Clover Insights shows that knowledge really is power.
How great is the opportunity ahead when it comes to data analysis? According to Forrester Research, most companies are only analyzing 12% of the data they have. Given the large amount of unstructured data (data defined as not being organized in a predetermined manner) companies have, this isn’t a surprise. By taking the time to analyze the data you’re already generating, Insights gives you the confidence to tackle some of your business’ biggest problems head on. Informationweek.com
Here are a few key data points you should watch closely in your Clover POS that’ll help you run your business more effectively: total sales, transaction amounts, labor costs, and purchase history for VIP customers. With Clover’s easy-to-use dashboard, each of these crucial data points are clearly accessible and keep you updated at a glance. Clover Insights even gives you the ability to have snapshots sent directly to you—ensuring you’re always in the know.
Not only do small businesses benefit from the precision offered by customer data, but that exposure to data encourages owner-managers to share insights with employees and get them involved in companies’ competitive thinking. Insights can help with this initiative by allowing you to compare sales and consumer spending trends at similar businesses to see how you stack up. Harvard Business Review
Companies in the top third of their industry in the use of data-driven decision making were, on average, 5% more productive and 6% more profitable than their competitors. With Clover Insights, it’s easy to see how you’re performing and understand the impact of your marketing efforts and improve future efforts. Harvard Business Review
One family-owned realty leveraged big data to increase their inventory by more than 10 percent over the past three years while cutting costs by 15 percent. The net result of their $40,000 investment? Those savings alone amounted to $50,000, helping their investment pay for itself within the first year. With Clover Insights, you have a much smaller investment that delivers a much larger ROI. How much smaller? Insights requires no additional hardware or software and is available wherever you work, on your computer or your phone. Inc.com
In addition to all of the above, Clover Insights also offers heat maps that show where your customers live and shop so you can better target your marketing. Plus, you can easily see your customers’ spending patterns, helping you bring in new business and find more customers like them. You can even access weather breakdowns that track how your business performs in different conditions so you know how to staff up or down and so much more.
With today’s ultra competitive market, you need to equip yourself with tools that let you crack the code of your business’ data, ultimately giving you a competitive advantage. With a Clover POS and Insights, you get just that.

news_225,news,5 free marketing tips for your business,"Getting more customers in the door is the goal of every business owner, but it can get expensive. Today we’re going to review some free marketing tips for your business so you can see a bump in foot traffic without having to shell out any cash at all. 
…",21-08-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-free-marketing-tips-business/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. 
Getting more customers in the door is the goal of every business owner, but it can get expensive. Today we’re going to review some free marketing tips for your business so you can see a bump in foot traffic without having to shell out any cash at all.
1. Social media marketing
Building an organic following on social media is certainly a time consuming endeavor, but it can pay off in the long run. There are a wide range of things you could post, but some of the most effective are posts about your products, customers, and team. Thinking of innovative ways to showcase your products will show customers why they need to come in sooner rather than later. Each time you have a new item in stock or added to your menu, you could introduce it on your social media accounts, from Instagram to Snapchat.
Featuring your loyal customers could also be a nice touch, whether that’s a picture of friends gathered for dinner around one of your tables or a repost of them rocking one of your new shirts (with permission of course!). User generated content creates authenticity and is a great way to supplement the posts you and your staff think up each week. Try out different posting times and hashtags to find the optimal time and cadence. Lastly, you could try a contest to gain more followers and foot traffic, asking participants to follow you and share a certain image with specific hashtags to be entered to win something free at one of your locations.
2. Create strong relationships with your neighbors
If your business is one of many in the area, there’s a good chance that the neighboring businesses could do a bit of your marketing for you, making this one of the best free marketing tips that will save you time. Make sure you’re known in your area as the expert in your niche. If your neighbors know exactly what you sell and maybe even stop by to buy something or chat every once in awhile, they’ll be much more likely to suggest your business when someone is looking for something in your realm of expertise. You chose your storefront locations for a reason, so it’s time to leverage those communities and build relationships that will take your business to the next level with word of mouth marketing.
3. Revamp your website
You already have a website, so updating the copy and images could be a great free way to market your business. Set a recurring task each month to rethink the images you feature in case you might have new products you’d like to feature. Each page on your website should keep a keyword in mind and mention it a few times in that page’s copy, as well as the meta title and description. Search engine optimization could have it’s own article on our blog, but the core of this free marketing tip is to keep your content, layout, and images fresh to put your best foot forward when potential customers happen upon your site.
4. Start a blog and a newsletter
Just as you share new products on your social media sites, you could also offer longer form spotlights on your blog that highlight customer stories, company announcements, thoughts on your industry, and upcoming sales. This free marketing tip goes along nicely with an updated website when you have fitting keywords picked out for each blog post to optimize for search engines and make sure you are using lots of appealing images. These blog posts can be the cornerstone of your monthly newsletters, offering announcements that your customers would find interesting. You can build up your email list with a pen and paper near your cash register or, if you use a digital rewards program, you can collect them automatically. Either way, staying in touch with your customers, offering promotions and news that are relevant to them will keep them coming back.
5. Offer a great employee experience
When your employees are happy, customers will notice. Your employees will be more helpful and cheerful when your business is meeting their needs in terms of providing a positive work environment, fair shift scheduling, and addressing their questions and concerns. Boosting employee retention will lower your costs, not to mention keep your business staffed with deeply knowledgeable team members. And on top of all of that, your employees will encourage their friends to apply and give you business as well.

news_227,news,The first 5 things you should do when building your online store,"Having a great online store is no longer a luxury for a small business, it’s a necessity. Selling online is a great way to draw new customers into your store, sell beyond your immediate location, and provide a convenient service for your best customers. …",22-08-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/first-5-things-building-online-store/,"Having a great online store is no longer a luxury for a small business—it’s a necessity. Studies show that people now buy more online than they do in physical stores. If you don’t have an online store, you’re missing out on a great way to draw new customers into your store, sell beyond your immediate location, and provide a convenient service for your best customers.
Setting up a killer website may sound difficult, but these days, technology has made it easier than you think. If you’ve set up a Facebook profile, you’ve got the technical skills you need to make a great website and sell your products online.
Here are the first 5 things you should do when building your online store:
1. Choose a platform that makes your job easy.
As a small business owner, you’ve got more than enough to do—you don’t need to spend hours getting your online store up and running. There are plenty of platforms available today that automate a lot of the process of setting up a site, without sacrificing quality. If you use the Clover Online Store, for example, you can choose to have all your inventory information automatically imported into your new store. That means you don’t have to take the time to manually create product pages for everything you sell.
2. Optimize it for mobile.
People now spend about five hours a day on their mobile devices. Think about your own experience—how often do you search for a product or a brand while you’re sitting on your couch, watching TV? Making sure your site loads quickly and looks great on a smartphone is crucial, as it’s very likely to be the first way your customer encounters your site. Using Clover Online is a great way to make sure your mobile site works perfectly—any template you use is automatically designed to load quickly and look great on any device. But whatever service you use, you’ll want to test your site on different devices and browsers just to make sure it works smoothly for all your customers.
3. Make security a top priority.
Half of all small businesses in the U.S. have been hacked in the past year. If you’re selling online, you need a way to securely accept payments. Clover Online uses Clover Payments, so it’s just as secure as your Clover POS system. Top-notch online security also means training your staff—and yourself—to take basic precautions to avoid falling victim to hackers. You can also buy a cyber liability policy to insure you against potential losses from a data breach—but of course, the best way to avoid any such losses is to avoid breaches in the first place.
4. Offer free shipping and returns, if you can.
Online shoppers hate paying too much for shipping. One survey found that 44% of people who abandoned an online shopping cart did it because the shipping costs were too high. Do some math and see if you can afford to offer free shipping, or free shipping for orders over a certain dollar amount—it’ll make a big difference to your customers. Returns are key, too, because returns are fairly common for online purchases. Making returns easy makes customers more likely to keep shopping with you. Clover Online can automatically generate a return policy if you just answer a few simple questions.
5. Get social.
About three-quarters of consumers use social media to help them make buying decisions. Today, if you’re not interacting with your customers online, you’re not participating in the most important conversations they’re having. Keeping up with social media can be a full-time job if you let it, but it doesn’t have to be. Look for tools that will streamline and automate the process as much as possible. A new update coming to Clover Online will soon automate the process of listing your business on multiple social media sites—you’ll be able to create a Facebook page, list your business’s correct contact information on Yelp and Google, and more. The site will also give you analytics for all these sites in one convenient dashboard.
A killer online store is a key way to attract new customers and provide a convenient service for your current customers. Customers today have high expectations—they’re used to buying almost anything online with just a few clicks. But the good news is, there are tools available that will enable you to set up a store that looks as good and works as smoothly as any major company’s.

news_228,news,Webinar takeaways: Carol Wood from Homebase,"Carol Wood of Homebase shared some great tips for employee retention with the Clover community in a recent webinar. In her presentation, she discussed key points you should consider as your small business grows
…",23-08-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/webinar-takeaways-carol-wood-homebase/,"It’s no secret that happy employees are crucial to small business success. In a company of 30 people, staff turnover can cost upwards of $18,000 each year. So, keeping your team invested serves not only to increase customer service, but also to keep your bottom line in check.
Carol Wood, Director of People Operations for Homebase, is no stranger to the field of employee retention. As a former Director of Human Resources for Fuddruckers, she’s got a ton of wisdom and experience that she graciously shared with the Clover community in a recent webinar.

In her presentation, she discussed key points you should consider as your small business grows:
Empower your employees.
Take a cue from Nordstrom, who takes this idea to the extreme. In their employee handbook, they list only one rule: “Use best judgment in all situations. There will be no additional rules.”
While this may seem too hands-off for you, the takeaway here is to let your employees shine. Allow them to intuitively develop their own customer relationships, learn from them about what they experience on the floor that you, as owner/manager, may not be privvy to, and leverage their diverse talents to offer the very best to your clients.
Recognize your employees and celebrate them.
Celebrations for your team can take many different forms. Simple first steps include recognizing birthdays and milestones that are important to your team members. Expand on these traditions, however, to include celebrations for staff accomplishments or goals met. Also create space for employees to recognize each other when good things happen, rather than save that power purely for management.
If you’re creating a staff appreciation event, make sure that it meets the desires or needs of your team above and beyond the needs of the business.
Include employees in your business.
To build loyalty and trust in your team, it’s important to share with them the goals of your business. Articulate how each team member contributes to the goals, and be as transparent as you are able about the financial risks and successes the business experiences. Consistent outlets for communication go a long way to establishing a deeper connection with your employees, keeping them invested in your business
Provide consistent scheduling.
Work/life balance is something everyone struggles with at every level of business from owner to temp. If you are able to establish regular schedules, and communicate them to your team, your employees will be grateful. Knowing when they are working and when they aren’t allows them to schedule other aspects of their life, and return to work (hopefully) rejuvenated.
Take a few moments and watch the webinar for yourself. There are many more tips and specific suggestions to help you keep your team happy and your customer service top notch. Carol also takes a few questions from live webinar participants, and answers questions like “What do you do if you’re worried about your employees building such loyal customers they take them elsewhere?”

news_229,news,New & notable in the Clover App Market: August 2017,"For many businesses, restaurant week is every week! We’re celebrating with some fresh new apps to help your restaurant stay on top of the lunch rush, no matter how busy it gets. From soup to nuts, these apps have you covered.…",28-08-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-clover-app-market-august-2017/,"August is here, and with it comes restaurant weeks around the country! Cafes and bistros all over are dishing up tasty treats for new fans and favorite loyalists. It’s a good time to treat yourself for all your hard work this year.
But for many businesses, restaurant week is every week! To celebrate our favorite bars, bistros, and bakeries, we’re serving up a fresh suite of apps designed by ITsoft available in the Clover App Market to help your restaurant stay on top of the lunch rush, no matter how busy it gets. The latest and greatest in apps to help you run your restaurant are TableMapp, Seed QSR, and Seed Digital Menu. Paired with Clover, these integrations help keep your restaurant running without a hitch.
TableMapp
TableMapp is a visual interface for table management in restaurants. It’s exactly what it sounds like: a map of your restaurant’s floor plan. Structure a custom map of your restaurant by choosing the shape, size, and location of tables. Construct landmarks such as walls and bars to help optimize space and help servers visualize their section. Much like a treasure map, TableMapp integrates directly with Clover Tables and Clover Register to help your team see exactly which tables are new, which have placed their order and which ones have paid their bill.

TableMapp helps you manage your team and provide excellent customer service. Allocate section and table assignments among servers to keep the lunch rush flowing. Restrict employee access only to assigned orders to keep wires from getting crossed in the kitchen. TableMapp works best for independent restaurants with between 10 and 25 tables. Run a tight ship with this handy little integration!
Seed QSR
Seed QSR was built for quick-serve restaurants (QSRs) who want full functionality of an ordering system with streamlined service. It was built for restaurants that do not need to assign orders to a table, but operate on an order-and-pay at the counter model. The goal is to get through an order through as accurately and quickly as possible!
How does it work? Efficiency is the name of the game with Seed QSR. The app will import your menu items, modifiers, discounts, customers and everything you need to get up and running fast. Seed QSR’s system is designed to give your staff the fewest steps to enter an order, but with additional features to highlight your menu through pictures, descriptions and nutritional values.The simple interface supports four order types: Dine-In, To Go, Delivery, and Pick Up or Call In orders. This powerful dashboard allows for easy order entry and management, as well as payment processing. Take a peek in this short introductory video:

Best of all, Seed QSR integrates seamlessly with your Clover system. This is the latest and greatest way to organize your menu the way that you want—and keep lines from stacking up around the corner.
Seed Digital Menu
Seed was designed specifically for restaurants that use Clover (we’re thrilled!). It’s a simple concept, with major implications for your business. Seed Digital Menu gives restaurants the tools they need in one location. It’s designed to operate by 3 roles, or profiles: manager, server, and host. Each view is customized with the exact information that role needs, right at your fingertips. Check it out:

If your restaurant uses TableMapp, your restaurant layout will transfer over to Seed Digital Menu. This mighty tool covers every aspect of running a busy restaurant, from wait list and reservation tracking, table timers, and scheduled menus to manager reports, discount and void functions, promo codes, and server reporting. Seed Digital Menu even allows for advance menu management and item pictures, descriptions, & nutrition.
This app is best for Full Service Restaurants looking to replace their existing “legacy” system. Any FSR with 20+ tables is the ideal candidate for Seed Digital Menu.
From soup to nuts, Clover’s POS system has you covered. Learn more about how your business can thrive with Clover and other (positively edible) apps from the Clover App Market.

news_230,news,5 questions to ask before discontinuing a product,"Discontinuing a product without taking your customers or your sales data into consideration is a rookie move. Consulting the right Clover apps and asking yourself these five questions can help you determine whether or not to eliminate a SKU from your inventory.
…",07-09-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-discontinuing-product/,"You’re a small business owner, but you’re also a customer yourself. Which makes you familiar with the sense of loss and feelings of heartbreak and disappointment when you discover that one of your favorite products has been discontinued. Thoughts like, “How dare they?” “What are they thinking?” or “Don’t they know how much people love that item?” have probably run through your head.
But then you put yourself back in the shoes of the merchant and recognize that there’s probably a very logical reason why the store is no longer selling your favorite product. After all, business owners don’t just randomly decide to eliminate certain SKUs from their shelves. Perhaps it’s simply no longer available. Or maybe its wholesale cost has risen dramatically, making the item unprofitable. It could even be that the clientele or the store’s product mix is changing and the item no longer fits in.
Of the many difficult situations merchants find themselves in, knowing when to discontinue a product can be one of the more challenging to navigate. Read on to learn the five questions smart business owners should ask before eliminating something from their inventory.
1. How popular is the product really?
It seems as if customers are always raving about how much they love the item. But do all consumers love it? Or are simply a few obsessed? When several shoppers are extremely vocal with their adoration, it can skew your knowledge about which inventory items are popular and which ones aren’t. To identify your bestsellers, you’ve got to go right to the source—your sales metrics.
Clover Insights gives you the data so you accurately know what’s flying off your shelves and what’s lingering longer than it should. The free app reveals sales trends—who’s buying what, when they’re buying it, and where they’re buying it—and reveals whether the product you’re planning to discontinue really is a bestseller or if it’s just a VIP amongst only a few customers. The data may contradict your beliefs about the situation, but you can be confident that Insights’ findings give you the knowledge you need to make better business decisions.
2. Is there any scenario in which you should consider selling the product?
Insights might reveal that the product in question has a small, but extremely loyal fan base. If that’s the case, it could make sense for you to keep the product available—under special circumstances. Some suppliers will give merchants in good standing the ability to place special orders (with no minimum purchase required). If this option is available, it’s a smart way for businesses to give their best customers a little extra for little to no cost. You also might be interested in continuing to stock the item even if its profit margin has disintegrated because of rising wholesale costs. Consider raising its retail price so that it’s profitable again. Devoted shoppers are likely to pay a higher price in order to get what they love.
When discontinuing an item because the supplier is phasing it out, you might consider locating another wholesaler. How do you know if the work involved is worth your time? If a competitor has the same or a similar item in his inventory, compare your business to his using Insights. If you’re neck-and-neck, don’t just cede the sales. Do the research required to find another supplier.
3. How will you break the news to your customers?
As a business owner, your job is to recognize that your actions are bound to upset some shoppers. When discontinuing their favorite product, it’s important to keep their emotions top of mind when determining how to spread the news. In some situations, an in-store sign might be the only communication you need. In other instances, however, personalized communication is best. If the product will only be available via special order, use Promos, a free app by Clover, to retain loyal fans. Send a personalized message via text, email, Facebook, or Twitter that informs them of the new process, plus a discount offer on their first special order.
While you may be disappointing some of your customers, discontinuing a product can also be an opportunity to engage with your larger customer base. Consider launching a fun, interactive marketing program. If a manufacturer is no longer making a certain flavor of ice cream, Promos can assist with a social media contest to pick which flavor is going to take its place. Or, when your pet store’s bestselling dog bones are no longer available from the supplier, hold a taste test for all your furry shoppers.
4. Do you have a similar product to refer shoppers to?
When a shopper learns a product is no longer available, in most instances her reply will be, “Do you have something similar?” If the answer is no, the consumer is likely going to head somewhere else in search of the original item. If you have something in stock that you can steer her towards, it’s likely she’ll give it a try. It’s possible for shoppers to switch their loyalty from one product to another; they may even like the replacement item better. Monitor retention levels via Insights and if there’s a sharp drop-off, run an automated win-back campaign using Promos to regain lost sales.
5. Will you be losing any cross-selling opportunities?
The product you’re discontinuing could drive the sales performance of others. Once eliminated from your inventory, customers might lose interest in those accessories, services or add-ons. Use the app Shopventory to track an unlimited number of SKUs and identify any cross sellers. Then look for any patterns. For instance, you might notice that most people buy two accessories each time they buy the item you’re thinking about discontinuing. Or perhaps a large percentage add a small gift card to their purchase, which would indicate that it’s likely being gifted to someone else. If you lose these additional sales, how will your bottom line be affected? The loss could be significantly more than just the one item from your inventory list.
Savvy business owners discontinue products all the time, but it’s never wise to make the decision spontaneously. Asking yourself these five thoughtful questions can help you make the right move—both for your customers and your bottom line.

news_231,news,Business problem turnaround: Creative ways to move product faster,"Buying low and selling high is a strategy as old as business itself. But what happens when that great buy turns out to be less than popular with customers? Inside, we outline several creative strategies for moving a lot of product quickly. 
…",12-09-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-creative-ways-move-product-faster/,"“Buy low and sell high” is one of the first few strategies crafty, business-minded kids employ when learning how to make money; from candy and baseball cards, to sneakers, and the like. And for a lot of people, that simple formula takes them right through adulthood and into their first (or second, or third) business.
But anyone who’s bought and sold for any period of time knows that buying and selling is less a formula and more a game of chance. While it’s got better odds than your average casino game, the operative word here is “odds.” There’s a chance you could lose on that great buy.
Some days, your number just doesn’t come up, leaving you with 10 cases of tomatoes well on their way to turning wrinkly, or a whole rack-load of winter coats in neon colors when black-on-black is what’s hot right now, or a whole kitchen full of sheet cakes for a wedding in which the bride never made it to the church.
Occasionally, taking your bump on the chin is inevitable. However, there are strategies to employ to move a lot of product quickly to avoid a big loss. The key is to get creative.
Below, we outline several creative ideas for moving product:
Food
Running a specials menu—When faced with a lot of a single ingredient and little time to move it, chefs have traditionally used the specials menu to promote a new, limited-time offering. Maybe eggplant is in season; try serving up eggplant parmesan. Carrots? Change out a traditional potato salad side for a carrot raisin salad instead. The options are endless. And then advertise your special with apps like Clover Promos or Rewards to send text messages or push notifications to your customers’ phones to prompt immediate action.
Upcycling—In addition to running a special, a trick of smart chefs has always been recycling/upcycling food items into other items for sale. A well-known example is turning old bread into bread pudding (see our post on bakery-specific strategies here), though using the fish from an unsold fish special in a soup, or burgers in chilli, later in the week is also a great idea. Even sandwiches from a deli case can be disassembled and the lunch meat used in deli salads or soups.
Retail
Think globally—When it comes to having a large stock of unpopular items, the problem is often seasonal, or cyclical. Even though ski season wraps up in early spring, in the far reaches of southern South America, winter’s just picking up. Consider building out a mirror of your website in another language to wholesale internationally. The same could go for an unpopular toy: while fidget spinners may be on their way out here, they may just now be catching on in South Asia or Africa. While traditionally out of reach, the internet has made those connections possible with the right research. It just takes a little digging and a lot of stamps.
Specialty markets—If looking to unload a lot of product a little closer to home, consider getting creative and reaching out to people who might be looking for a lot of the same kind of item. For example, dance teams, theatre, and TV productions often need a lot of the same types of items for costumes. In addition, artists occasionally want, for example, thousands of doll heads or matchbox cars for a project. Other businesses who are selling that craft, hand-made aesthetic often need hundreds of mason jars for packaging. The key here is finding the market and pitching them—they often don’t know they’re interested until the opportunity’s been put in front of them.
All of the above and beyond
Make good while doing good—When worst comes to worst, there’s always the donation option. While giving your goods away might not be ideal, it’s possible to manage the pain by making the most of the situation. First, figure out a way to turn your balance sheet loss into a PR win by partnering with a local charity to maximize the goodwill generated. Creating an event where unwanted toys, extra food, or new clothes are given to the needy is a great way to give a little back while getting a little attention for yourself and your business. In addition, it’s certainly possible to get a decent valuation on the donation of new goods for the purpose of a tax write-off, making your responsibility to Uncle Sam a little more palatable at the end of the year.

news_232,news,Enterprise behavior: How to spend your marketing budget,"For small businesses, every dollar counts, and it can seem difficult to find a dedicated budget for marketing. Yet your marketing budget need not be large to make an impact. Here are the top four ways you should be spending your marketing dollars.…",13-09-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-spend-marketing-budget/,"For small businesses, every dollar counts, and it can seem difficult to find a dedicated budget for marketing. Yet your marketing budget need not be large to make an impact. The key is to be strategic with your money, focus on reaching local customers, and make sure your marketing supports your overall business goals. Done right, marketing tactics will build off one another so that you can leverage your investment, and formalizing a plan for how to spend your marketing dollars is the first step. Here are the top four ways you should be spending your marketing budget.
1. Search engine optimization (SEO)
More than one in five shoppers research their purchases online before buying. This makes your website crucially important to increasing sales. It pays to spend some money not only on creating an aesthetically pleasing site, but one that ranks well on search engines so that shoppers discover you when searching for your products or services. Simple changes, like showing images of products or improving the checkout flow, can really improve sales. Creating an e-commerce website can seem overwhelming, but there are many vendors who can help get you set up quickly with the right architecture to optimize for SEO. Clover Online, for example, can help design a mobile-friendly, e-commerce site that is fully integrated with your Clover POS system. You’ll be able to accept the same payment options you do in store with state-of-the-art encryption and security. Once you make the initial investment in building the site, it takes little effort and money to keep it optimized, especially if it’s synced with your POS and inventory system.
2. Email marketing
According to the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), every dollar spent on email marketing brings in an average of 38 dollars in return. Email is extremely cost-effective, which is why it’s still one of the most popular methods of advertising and should represent about 10 percent of your marketing budget.
The XLS Uploader app helps you upload your current spreadsheet of customers into your Clover POS device. If you already have a marketing automation service, such as MailChimp or Constant Contact, you should sync up your contacts regularly from your POS device to keep your database up to date. When first starting out, try to email your customers once a month about upcoming specials or tips on how to use products. Over time, you should start to develop automatic messaging to thank customers for their purchase, to re-engage old customers, or to build a community.
If you don’t already have an email automation service, start with Clover’s free app Promos to send out promotions and coupons to customers. When you’ve built up enough data, you can upgrade your email marketing by subscribing to Customer Engagement Plus to send real-time promotions, automated win-back campaigns, and more targeted campaigns.
3. Search engine marketing
According to WordStream, 64.6% of people click on Google ads when they are searching for something online. This makes pay-per-click advertising, whether on Google Adwords, Bing, or Yahoo, an obvious choice for small businesses. Paid search ads also allow you to target local audiences or even to upload your email list to target past customers. Because there is no minimum spend, you can start small with a few basic ads and build up from there. This type of marketing, whether on search engines or sponsored ads on social media, should represent about 20% of your marketing budget.
Extend the reach of your paid search ads with Voicemonk’s Smart Customer Engagement app. This app engages customers through Facebook messenger, Facebook ads, SMS, and Alexa making it really easy to leverage the ads you’ve already created for paid search. The Smart Customer Engagement app is also a good investment because it can also be used to respond to customer queries and offer better customer service.
4. Social media
Social media is one of the best ways to get word-of-mouth marketing…once you have a following. If you’re just starting out, consider adding a message to follow you on social media to every receipt. Apps like Rovely make this process easy. Rovely adds links to digital receipts, like emails and text messages, and QR codes on printed receipts so customers can follow or like you with a simple click. Offering incentives, like special promotions, previews to new styles and products, or unique content can help you build up your following fast.
Ninety-two percent of consumers read online reviews before buying, so part of your social media plan should be to regularly scan review platforms. BeSocial is a tool to help you track your ranking on Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare, and monitors your online reputation on Yelp and Google. BeSocial can also take some of the work out of posting content by scheduling and sharing content across your platforms throughout the day.
5. Promotions
Nothing sparks sales like a good promotion. Whether creating coupons, combinations, or special discounts, you’ll need the technology to print coupons or apply instant discounts in the cart. Coupons N Combos is a very reasonable option for facilitating promotions and creating printable ads. Having this technology will help you quickly implement promotions during holidays or just to help perk up a slow period. Mix it up and see what gets your customers excited.
Before making final decisions on where to spend your budget, take the time to learn more about your best customers. One of the many benefits of using Clover’s POS are the free apps that give you marketing intelligence. Clover Insights, for example, offers trends in sales, who is buying what products, and when. This real-time data will help leverage your marketing dollars by targeting your ads to specific customers when they are most likely to buy.

If your business features golfing, cigars, vacation tours, or equipment rentals, don’t miss three new apps that streamline and simplify. …",18-09-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-clover-app-market-september-2017/,"Most Clover merchants rely on a few key apps to boost their speed and accuracy. Others regularly test and adopt great new software being added to the Clover App Market—and save themselves even more time and effort.
Don‘t get stuck in a rut. Whether you’re developing a customer loyalty program, booking reservations, handling deliveries, or marketing with social media, there’s a Clover app that can help you do it faster and more effectively.
Check out the Clover App Market for a full listing of free and fee-based apps. Read on to learn about three intriguing apps developed for specific markets: golf courses, cigar shops, and businesses that collect lots of signatures, such as shops that rent canoes or bikes.
Link Quick18 reservations with Clover check-outs.
Now that customers can book tee times online with Quick18 Teesheet, it’s never been easier to organize an outing. The software has been a boon for the 15,000-plus golf courses now operating in the United States.
Many of those courses also use Clover to process customers’ payments for time on the green to food and drinks at the bar. And that’s where technology can frustrate—you’re forced to use different systems for different functions.
Quick18 Teesheet integrates the two systems. When a golfer with a Quick18 reservation checks in, the data automatically transfers to the Clover pay screen, where you can quickly check them out.
The Clover screen lists the rate the golfer was charged—including member price, PGA discounts, or public rate—whether the player has requested 9 or 18 holes, and any taxes due. Handling complete transactions is a breeze!
Merge the ease of DocuSign with the convenience of Clover.
In fast-paced settings like a check-in desk, speed and simplicity are critical. But for many small businesses, taking shortcuts can lead to lost investments and legal exposure.
A family of four, for example, arrives for their helicopter tour, while another group wants to rent surfboards for an afternoon on the waves. Protecting the business means lots of waivers, agreement forms, and general chaos at the start.
Fortunately, most business have moved away from paper and now automate the process using DocuSign, a popular e-signature service. To make it even easier, Clover has teamed with DocuSign to integrate the SimpliSign app.
Simply upload agreements, release forms, and other documents from your DocuSign account to the Clover station. Clover automatically fills in key information, lets you gather signatures digitally, and stores the information to your DocuSign account.
By blending technologies into a seamless experience, check-in becomes quick, secure, and reliable.
Bring your massive cigar inventory under control.
If you own a cigar shop, you need more than a breathtaking variety of stock. You’ve also got to know exactly what you have and where to find it. But with tens of thousands of individual cigars, that’s a lot of inventory to keep track of!
Cigaratory was developed to tame the madness. Using your Clover device, the app lets you manage inventory, break boxes into multiple types (sample packs, singles, etc.), create sample packs of different types of cigars, generate purchase orders, and gather information on vendors and customers.
Using the Clover station as a command center, Cigaratory handles the nitty-gritty of running the cigar business—letting owners focus on acquiring great products and sharing expertise with aficionados.
Clover helps you get things done. From taking orders to keeping track of inventory to scheduling employees, the sleek POS and array of apps are great for automating tasks, reducing errors, and eliminating extra steps. Make your life easier—with apps.

news_235,news,Small space? Use inventory management apps to reduce what you need to keep in stock,"With the continuously growing food truck movement, pop ups and alternative restaurants, it seems that restaurant space is getting smaller and smaller. The good news is that with the right tools, managing your inventory with care is within reach!  …",19-09-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/small-space-use-inventory-management-apps-reduce-need-keep-stock/,"This is a guest post by the team at SimpleOrder.
With the continuously growing food truck movement, pop ups and alternative restaurants, it seems that restaurant space is getting smaller and smaller. This is part of a broader trend towards micro-sizing (like the tiny house craze): people are reducing their carbon footprint by utilizing less space. This is great news for the environment, but for businesses, can make it difficult to coordinate inventory.
In a small space, where every inch counts, it can be difficult to assess how much and exactly what inventory you need to keep on hand at all times. No chef, for example, wants to run out of essential ingredients and lose potential sales. Thus, it becomes necessary to manage inventory more carefully and consistently. The good news is that with the right tools, managing your inventory with care is within reach.
With the proper inventory management tools and a great POS system, you can constantly evaluate your inventory and sales assess whether they are in tandem. These two systems should work together to constantly tracking your sales, purchases, and inventory levels so they provide your restaurant with crucial analytics. This streamlines the reconciliation you need to do manually, and provides you with the exact numbers you need so that you can track and monitor your business.
By tracking your inventory levels in real time, you’ll also measure your costs of goods sold (COGS), essentially telling you the value of your stock. Take this number and divide it by two to get your inventory turnover ratio, a number that measures how many times you sold your total average inventory during the period your COGS was calculated.
If your inventory turnover ratio is high, this usually indicates that you are buying and selling your inventory consistently, but if the number is high and your POS reports show low sales, it will indicate that your inventory levels are too low.
Doing this crucial calculation is just one reason that having the proper tools to track your sales, purchases, and inventory will indicate trends that are important. You’ll know exactly what items you are selling most of, what ingredients are essential, and how often you need to order. Armed with this information, you won’t have to use your already limited space to stock up on items you can easily order. (And as a bonus, you can use a back-of-house ordering app to replenish inventory with one click when levels are running low.) When you have a smaller space, you have to work smarter. Implementing the right inventory management platform and POS system will help you do just that.

SimpleOrder is a world-leading online inventory and purchasing platform, optimizing restaurant back-of-house operations, from the purchase order to the point-of-sale, for more than 1,500 locations in 14 countries. Integrated with a Clover POS, SimpleOrder Automatic Inventory reduces inventory levels for each dish restaurants sell and streamlines stock replenishment in real-time.

news_236,news,Business scenario: Reducing shrinkage,"Does it feel like your inventory is disappearing? Whether it’s shoplifting, employee theft, or a black hole, business shrinkage accounts for a loss of about 2% of sales each year. Here’s everything you need to know to make sure your company is growing -- not vanishing into thin air. 
…",20-09-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-reducing-shrinkage/,"It’s time to talk about shrinkage. No, not that kind of shrinkage—we’re talking about shrinkage in the business sense. “Shrinkage” is a retail term for stealing, by random shoppers, actual customers, or your own staff. And while it’s common in the retail industry, it happens to small businesses everywhere.
Whenever you lose product without earning any revenue from selling it, that’s shrinkage. It can hit your bottom line more than you may realize. In the retail industry, the average shrink percentage is estimated to be about 2% of sales. All that added up to more than $49 billion in losses in 2016, according to the National Retail Security Survey on retail theft.
Luckily, there are some easy things you can do to better understand business shrinkage and protect yourself accordingly. Here’s what you need to know to reduce shrinkage.
What is shrinkage?
There are four common sources of shrinkage in a business. Employee theft, shoplifting, paperwork errors, and supplier fraud are all the major reasons why your balance sheet might not match inventory. There’s also a fifth category of shrinkage, which encompasses all the unknown reasons for loss. This is the black hole that things seem to disappear into for no reason.
It’s important to realize just how big an impact shrinkage can have on your bottom line. Not only are you losing inventory, but you’re losing the opportunity to make a sale if something goes missing. Paying for the same inventory twice over can have implications on pricing for your customers. In addition, shrinkage can increase company costs in other areas: security, for example, can be a big budget item to defend yourself against shoplifting.
What are some ways to reduce shrinkage?
There are some key things you can do to reduce business shrinkage without making a big investment. The first step is knowing where it’s impacting you most: which products go missing, and who is most likely the guilty party. One way to do that is to invest in an inventory management tool. Clover POS comes with a powerful inventory tracking system, and you can add an app from the Clover App Market to customize your system to your needs.
Then, prioritize: it might not be a huge deal if customers take unauthorized seconds from your soda fountain. It’s a different story if your wait staff takes open bottles of wine home after a late shift. High-revenue or high-cost products that have a significant impact on your ROI should be your focus. Resist the temptation for people to lift things by storing valuable items in secure areas that require higher authorization levels for access.
Of course, your employees might not be the culprits of your shrinkage problem. While tightening up your policies and training your staff can certainly help improve inventory management, it may be a problem outside their control. If it’s too difficult or awkward to lock up a given product, consider alternate solutions that work with the situation more gracefully. Shift your thinking toward a loss-prevention strategy to find ways to recoup costs. For instance, making free seconds on sodas part of what you’re marketing (and charging more per soda to account for the added cost).
Finally, consider how the layout of your store can impact shoplifters. Is there a way to reorganize your displays to give your employees space to observe? Simply moving things around may be enough to prevent needing a security system.
How can I see if my plan works?
Are you certain you know where your inventory is going? Get a clear picture of whether or not your strategy is working with a few simple apps. Clover integrations like Ping Me If, Bottle Keeper, and Cash Track can trigger alerts when certain events happen. Monitor cash in and cash out, keep an eye on a certain item, and even track your liquid stock so you don’t have to count bottles each day.
Keep an eye on your accounting with a clear picture of your payments and receipts. Clover Payments Plus elevates your business metrics to show you cash in and cash out, sales, employee management and scheduling, and inventory tracking, all in one dashboard. Unearth insights you might not usually see each day to make sure that your business is growing—not shrinking.

news_237,news,7 useful apps for small businesses,"With the help of technology, there are a number of useful apps that keep your business running smoothly day in and day out. It’s helpful to know what tools are out there as you decide how you want to set up your best practices. Read on for some of our favorites.…",26-09-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/7-useful-apps-small-businesses/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. 
Every small business owner wants to be able to do more in less time. Luckily, with the help of technology, there are a number of useful apps that keep things running smoothly day in and day out. From password management systems to meditation reminders, these apps will help any small business owner boost productivity and even make a crazy day a bit less chaotic. While not all of these apps can integrate directly with your Clover device, it’s helpful to know what tools are out there as you decide how you want to set up your best practices.
1. Google Drive
Google Drive is a one-stop shop for free productivity tools. Similar to Microsoft Office, Google Docs handles documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, along with a host of templates and plugins that’ll help you get more done even faster. Google Drive also includes file storage and sharing, so you can upload any file and share it with anyone in just a few clicks. You’ll also have access to your files on virtually any device, including your smartphone. This can be particularly useful for management-level communications and record keeping.
2. HR Resources App
Sitting in the back office buried in paperwork is no way to spend the day when there are useful apps to help you with HR. I mean, you could scour the internet looking for templates for employee reviews, new hire documents, and more. Or, you could go straight to your HR Resources app to find everything you need at your fingertips. You can create job description documents, and establish consistency across your interviews for various levels of positions. No small business should neglect regulation on this front, and HR Resources makes best and fair practices easy.
3. Wunderlist / Google Keep
Keeping track of everything you have to do is a task in and of itself. That’s why to do list apps have been doing so well. You already keep your phone within arm’s reach for most of the day, so why not use it to keep track of the tasks you have to complete? Whether it’s reminding you to submit payroll or to pick up milk on your way home, it can help you remember anything from professional to personal. I’m a big fan of these apps because it’s easy to organize tasks and invite collaborators (such as managers at certain locations) to keep everyone on track. When you set up your reminders for tasks, you’ll never forget a deadline again because you can access tasks across all your devices. Try Wunderlist on iOS and Android, and Google Keep on all platforms.
4. Clover Rewards
Your customers love buying from you and putting a digital rewards program in place could further sweeten the deal. Maybe you’ve used punch cards for years or are worried that customers won’t want to take the time to sign up for it. Clover Rewards is definitely worth a try. What’s great about Rewards is that through the Clover app you can create your own loyalty program that makes sense for your business. From the app, you can launch email marketing campaigns and gain new customers. The platform definitely does more than your average stamp card, making it one of the most useful apps for small businesses.
5. Yelp for Business Owners
To say the least, Yelp changed the game. It was a blessing and sometimes even a curse for small businesses. Glowing reviews attract more customers who stumble upon you online and give you a try because your star rating is out of this world. But one and two star reviews also have a big impact when you only have a few reviews. With Yelp for Business Owners, you can know what customers are saying about you and respond in real-time. That way you can address problems right after they happen, potentially turning disgruntled customers’ frowns upside down. Beyond that, you can also see your page’s metrics in terms of how many visitors you got each day, update your pictures, and respond to messages right from the app. Try Yelp for Business Owners on iOS and Android.
6. Headspace
Running a business takes a lot of mental energy, and getting burnt out isn’t an option. Taking time to recharge periodically will keep stress at bay and help you remain calm, even during difficult customer interactions. There are a number of meditation apps popping up that aim to do just that. Headspace is one of the best because it works around your schedule and helps you meditate to manage sleep issues or stress levels in just a few minutes a day. Beyond helping you find balance through meditation, it also guides you through exercises to boost focus and compassion—and we can all use a bit more of that. Find Headspace on iOS and Android.
7. Homebase
Scheduling your employees takes time when you’re doing it the old school way. You have to take into account their availability, make sure you’re properly staffed for each shift, and manage breaks as well. Now there’s a way to do it all from your mobile phone, so that you aren’t glued to Excel anymore. Homebase’s Schedule and Time Clock apps both integrate seamlessly with Clover. They even let you put your scheduling on autopilot with the ability to copy last week’s schedule, or even automate the entire process. On the employee side, your employees get reminders when they need to come in. Reduced no-shows and an easier scheduling process certainly make for a useful app for small business owners.

The counter or central point-of-sale terminal is an anchor piece of real estate in all types of restaurants, from corner cafes to full-service locations.
But given present-day consumer expectations and behaviors–both those brought about by new technologies and those that have stood the test of the time–restaurant managers should think more holistically about how they use space to increase revenue, maximize operational efficiency and/or boost customer satisfaction. Technology, and in particular mobile point-of-sale technology, makes this more possible than ever.

news_239,news,Business accelerators: 5 ways to make your pop-up locations successful,"In our previous post, we discussed 6 ways pop ups can help a business. In this companion post, we’ll go beyond why they work to focus more on how pop ups work, tackling some of the common logistical hurdles you might encounter.
…",03-10-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-5-ways-make-pop-locations-successful/,"In our previous post about pop-ups, we discussed six ways they can help a business. It was a great primer about how a pop-up can contribute to your bottom line. But, because we’re Clover, we didn’t want to stop there. So in this companion post, we’ll focus more on how pop-ups work, tackling some of the common logistical hurdles you might encounter.
Choose the right location.
One thing you’ll find when researching possible pop-up locations is that there are a lot of choices out there. That’s when it’ll behoove you to remember the old real estate adage: “location, location, location.” You’ll want to position your pop-up in a high-traffic area that makes sense for your clientele. The Insights app from Clover can analyze your business’s specific characteristics and provide you deep understanding of where the best location might be relative to your existing—and potential—customers.
Go in with eyes wide open.
For being a short-term site, there are a lot of moving parts to consider—most of which can have an impact on your long-term finances. Rent and utility costs, storage and display spaces for inventory, internet availability, and type of point-of-sale system are just a few considerations to check off of a long list. Your goal is to make money, so make sure you’re fully aware of the depth and breadth of the financial implications your pop-up location budget carries with it.
Make sure it’s a good fit.
As we pointed out in the previous article, sometimes solo businesses aren’t able to attract much traffic as a standalone proposition. But, when complemented by a smartly selected partner that shares a similar customer base, a profitable synergy forms that’s good for both businesses. The question is: which combinations of brands do and don’t make sense in a pop-up location?
For example, a breakfast concept is a natural pairing with a dinner restaurant pop-up, since the hours don’t conflict and you’ll both be needing food prep. But be aware that the “breakfast-y” atmosphere needs to be quickly and easily transformed into a dinner ambiance. Beyond this example, you’ll need to coordinate things like: hours of operation, clean-up requirements (mainly for food service), foot traffic considerations, licensing and permits, inventory storage, and more. By maintaining a delicate balance between the hosting merchant and the pop-up, you can ensure a smooth operation for both of your businesses.
Know when it’s time to stay put.
By their very nature pop-ups are designed to be a temporary arrangement. (Think merchants using the space to capitalize on seasonal trends like Halloween.) However, what happens when a pop-up is faced with the fact that they’re doing so well they can justify committing to a permanent space? This reality presents logistical hurdles of its own.
When shifting a growing clientele to a new permanent address, visibility is everything. You need to advertise and showcase your new location so you can ensure your customers are in the know. Tell them your new address along with directions from your current location, parking requirements (if any), hours of operation, and grand opening date. Armed with this information, your customers with be able to smoothly transition their business from old to new.
Get the right POS system.
We alluded to this earlier, but the importance of this step cannot be overstated. Having a flexible point-of-sale system can make all the difference between success and failure. That’s why Clover offers so many choices for merchants that match the way they do business.

Clover Station, a traditional countertop POS, features a pivoting touchscreen and the ability to accept all types of payments.
The ultra-portable Clover Flex helps you accept payments wherever you are—whether in the aisle, at the table, or at the counter.
The Clover Mini is perfect for simple payment processing or acting as full-featured POS.
The Clover Mobile is a portable, powerful POS that fits in the palm of your hand.
The Clover Go lets you accept credit card payments on the go or wirelessly from your own tablet or smartphone.

With the information above as a starting framework, do your research, talk to peers, and consult with experts. Think carefully about whether a pop-up is a good fit, consider the marketplace realities and think about what actions on your and your team’s part will be required to make it a success.

news_240,news,Business problem turnaround: Second location isn’t replicating the original location’s success,"Business was booming and you decided to take the next step—a new location. You’ve tried your best to clone the success of your first location, but your new location just isn’t performing as it should. Don’t panic! Here are 5 steps to turn around your new location fast.
…",04-10-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-second-location-isnt-replicating-original-locations-success/,"Business was booming and you decided to take the next step—a new location. You’ve tried your best to clone the success of your first location, but your new location just isn’t performing as it should.
It’s a frustrating problem, so we’re putting some thought-starters on the table. Think through whether any of the five tactics below might start you down the road to a turnaround.
1. Get scientific.
Isolate the problem by comparing locations to determine how your new space is underperforming. Are overall sales slower? Are costs higher at the new place, eating into profits? How does the per-ticket transaction amount compare between the two? Is there enough foot traffic to generate enough sales? Clover Insights is tool that can help you dissect the problem. Not only can you compare your two locations, you can compare your stores to competing stores in both locations. This will give you a sense of whether the location itself is contributing to poor business performance, or whether there’s something not quite working yet in the new store that you need to address. Isolating the issue can help you trouble-shoot quick ways to turn the business around.
2. Take stock.
Now that you have a good idea of what the problem might be, it’s time to take stock of your resources to turn things around. Do you have enough staff at your new location to help increase sales? Do you have money to do some special promotions?
Take the information you gleaned above and determine whether you have what you need to address the problem. For example,

If the per-ticket amount is lower in the new location, you’ll need to come up with ways to increase the amount of each sale. This conclusion can raise more constructive questions like: Is the staff in the new location trained to upsell or cross-sell additional items? Would temporarily moving some of your more experienced staff to the new location to train the newbies help? A different tactic might be to display impulse buys near the register to encourage impromptu sales: Do you have enough inventory of these items, and are they displayed effectively?
If foot traffic is low, perhaps you haven’t successfully gotten the word out that you are open for business. Try promotions directed at local businesses or residents. Spending money on converting locals into customers is a good investment, because they are more likely to become return visitors. If you have some customers, you can test giving them special deals that they can pass on to family and friends. Apps like Digital Word of Mouth let customers share information with their contacts easily and can simplify marketing. Also consider trying location-based marketing techniques, including SMS push notifications with TapLocal Marketing, Adwords, or social media sponsored ads. The Clover App Market has tons of tools to help you market a new location. (Also check out our previous post, “Dealing With Slow Foot Traffic“.)
If costs are higher at the new location, look for ways renegotiate some of these costs. For example, ask the utility company to do an energy audit, inquire in the town if there are any tax breaks for new businesses, or buy in bulk to reduce delivery fees. If the new location is just too expensive to keep open as a brick-and-mortar business, consider whether you can open a mobile location like a food truck or rent space from another retailer.

3. Automate and outsource.
Many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of trying to do everything themselves. While your passion and drive are likely key reasons your business was successful enough to open a second location, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll be able to split that passion into two locations without a little help.
Take a step back from the business and consider what key elements are necessary to make your business work. Brainstorm ways to replicate those success factors with minimal involvement from you. Can some of the more mundane tasks, such as scheduling and staffing, be automated with an app? Are you getting the most out of the equipment and people you already have? Clover can help you leverage your POS system to manage different aspects of your business from accounting, to marketing, to ecommerce.
4. Go mobile.
If you’re not able to spend enough time at the new location, make sure you have real-time access to your systems and progress at both locations. A mobile POS helps you maintain visibility into both locations—so you can spend more time where you’re most needed. If long lines are discouraging sales, you can also use your mobile device to line bust, or experiment with sidewalk sales or other mobile locations.
5. Rally around the cause.
If you reach the point when you think you have a good idea of what’s not working and have the makings of an action plan on how to tackle it, it’s time to get your staff behind you. Make sure they understand their role in making the business a success. Ask top-performing staff to train others in customer service and upselling techniques, and make sure to motivate them periodically. For example, consider tracking who brings in the most sales and motivate them further with an extra perk or a piece of the action. Now that you have a second location, you need a team of people to help you make it a success. Don’t go it alone: Call and ask for our multi-location support.

news_241,news,Growing pains: How to handle HR issues (without an HR department),"Neglecting important human resources issues, can cost a pretty penny. When you don’t have an HR department, though, you have to find ways to maintain your team yourself. Read on for tips on how your Clover POS can keep your business running in tiptop shape.…",09-10-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-how-to-handle-hr-issues-without-hr-department/,"It’s no secret that employees are a valuable component of small business. They are your frontline for customer service and have a profound effect on your bottom line. But managing your employees, when you don’t have an HR department, can often be placed on the backburner. Sure, you know that it’s important to conduct reviews and engage with your employees in theory, but there’s always something that needs your attention when you run an SMB, right?
Neglecting important human resources issues, however, can cost a pretty penny. Conservative estimates place the cost of losing a salaried employee around 50-75% of that position’s annual salary. Does that seem high? Remember how many factors are at play when finding a replacement: recruitment, training, supervision, and much, much more.
For high-level employees, that amount skyrockets. For C-level employees at medium-sized businesses, the cost of turnover can be upwards of 200% of the position’s annual salary. Beyond the cost of just that position, turnover also lowers workplace morale, which in turn lowers income.
So how do you mitigate this issue if you don’t have an HR department? You have to decide to serve as that department yourself, setting aside some time each week or month to keep an eye on best practices for your team.
There are two main branches of human resources you’ll need to consider when running your SMB—personnel management and record keeping. While you might not have a department or a dedicated staffer to monitor HR, you’ve got countless solutions at your fingertips in your Clover point-of-sale system.
Personnel management
If you want to learn more about keeping your employees happy, a great place to start would be our recent webinar on employee empowerment. Having a team that’s invested in your business will keep things running more efficiently, and in all likelihood, more profitably.
Scheduling is a huge sticking point for a lot of employers and employees alike. If you can work out regular scheduling practices, it frees up more attention to place back into innovating your business. In addition to Homebase’s excellent apps, you can also assess Dolce’s Scheduling, Timekeeping, & Analytics app and see which is a better buy for your business.
It’s also important to note that whether you’re working with your friends or with strangers, there are creative ways to build your team. Making sure your employees are happy in their roles should be a top priority for you.
When you do need to replace a staffer, Clover’s got apps that can help you there, too. If you visit the Clover App Market, you can find a host of solutions. Try JobPose to recruit more effectively and get the word out about new opportunities in your business.
Record keeping
The drier side of HR is the paper-pushing. Documentation is important on many levels: tax reporting, budget planning, tracking performance, and supporting difficult decisions including termination.
Luckily, apps from the Clover App Market can help you here, too. You’ll find nearly everything you need within Homebase’s HR Resources app. You can create and save job descriptions, performance reviews, new hire forms, and hiring guides.
You can also utilize Pupsidedown’s Release, Waiver, Compliance forms for your team as well as your customers. Keeping track of your legal documents is crucial, but easily outsourced to your Clover device.
No matter how you choose to do so, maintaining best practices for human resources doesn’t require an HR department. And keeping your employees happy will most certainly be a boost for your bottom line.

Are there enough checkout stations to keep lines moving? Can you better manage the influx of in-store, online, and mobile orders? How can you shorten delivery times?
In every area, the Clover POS helps small businesses run faster, smoother, and more efficiently. Not only does the Clover system expertly handle transactions at the counter or on the go, but a fleet of apps also simplifies scheduling, payroll, inventory, marketing, customer service, and more.
Plus, new apps are constantly added to the Clover App Market that target difficult or time-consuming tasks. Check out these four apps for speeding up deliveries, ordering, and checkout, as well as instantly disseminating information about your business across the web.
Better Delivery
Let’s face it, deliveries are often a bit of a mess. While orders eventually make their way into customers’ hands, they often get there via meandering paths, with little communication between runs.
Better Delivery makes the process far more efficient. When orders come in, Clover POS software assigns them to a geographical quadrant: SE, SW, NE, or NW. The nearest driver receives orders through a mobile app designed for their phones.
The app directs the driver to the shortest route for getting from place to place, then back to the restaurant. Employees save on fuel and frustration, while cutting delivery time for customers.
Better Delivery goes further to let customers and staff track orders in real time. The app links driver data to the company website so everyone can see where on a map the driver is located and when the food is expected to arrive.
Find out how easy it is to manage deliveries with a 30-day free trial.
ShopScanGo
Instead of funneling every customer and purchase through checkout lines, why not let select shoppers handle checkout themselves?
With ShopScanGo, trusted customers use an iOS app on their smartphones to scan items as they shop and add them to their tab. When done, they check out and pay with their app, at a self-payment station, or at a checkout counter—whichever works best for your setup.
The app delivers a faster, more empowering experience for both customers and merchants. The Clover station displays profiles of ShopScanGo customers as they enter the door and tallies items that they put in their baskets. You can monitor shoppers without lifting a finger, and reduce wait times without increasing staff.
ShopScanGo comes with a bonus feature as well: Use it to alert customers of storewide or targeted deals and drive traffic to the store. At checkout, discounts are automatically applied by simply tapping a button.
Effortless, cost-effective, ingenious—this is one simple app that makes a serious impact.
Clover Go Update
With the newly updated Clover Go, smartphones are transformed into mobile Clover processing stations.
This popular app lets delivery staff and on-the-move employees ring up orders and process payments right on their handheld devices. Every sale syncs with the Clover POS dashboard, helping you track data in one central hub.
New features make Clover Go even more useful and versatile. The app simplifies ordering with a redesigned checkout screen. Quickly and intuitively, it lets employees find items from an inventory and add them to an order. It automatically adds state and local sales taxes, reads credit and debit cards, and retrieves email addresses to make sending receipts a breeze.
Employees will appreciate a new feature that asks customers to select a tip, while merchants will enjoy administrative controls that ensure transactions are properly recorded and data accurately stored.
Clover Go helps you run your business smoothly, from anywhere.
Clover Online Listings
Dozens of websites list local business data, such as hours of operation, holiday closings, promotions, menus, and locations.
For businesses with the time to regularly add or update information, these services are great. But for everyone else, they can be a major headache. Consider what happens when someone reads that your restaurant is open at noon, but you’re actually closed until dinner. Frustrated customers rarely come back.
Clover Online brings order to the chaos. Now pre-installed on the Clover web dashboard for all Clover merchants, including Payments Plus clients later this month, this powerful software lets you quickly create a professional business presence, restaurant website, or e-commerce store.
But the new version of Clover Online doesn’t stop there. Clover Online Listings automatically publishes your business hours, location, phone number, website, products and much more across a network of maps, apps, search engines, social networks, and directories—70+ sites in all, including Google, Facebook, Yelp, Tripadvisor, Yahoo and more. Simply update once on the Clover dashboard and the app triggers changes as fast as each site allows, often within seconds. That means you can push your Holiday hours or promotions across the web almost instantly.
Another handy feature is in-store pickups. For merchants who deal with online purchases and shipping, the app offers buyers a “click-and-collect” option. During checkout, customers select pickup rather than shipping, and automatically receive an email when the order is ready.
Local customers save waiting time and mailing costs, while business owners gain an edge over their online competitors.
Discover these and a wealth of other tools for running your business in the Clover App Market or pre-installed on your Clover web dashboard.

1. Concentrate on channels that matter.
There are literally hundreds of social media platforms. Figure out which platforms are most likely to work for you and focus your efforts there first. One quick way to research whether a platform is likely to be worthwhile is to look up your competition and see where their social media following is the strongest. (Check out our post 5 questions to ask before adopting a new social media platform for advice on how to select social media platforms.) Then, as you gain traction, broadcast out to multiple channels using apps such as Hopr, which will let you monitor your presence in social media on facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and respond to what’s trending quickly.
2. Engage influencers.
When first starting out, ask employees to follow and repost your messages. They are your first circle of influencers. Then entice customers to follow and engage in your content by offering incentives. Social Branding, an app available in the Clover App Market can help build up a social media following by promoting your channels right on your receipts. If there are highly-visible influencers, such as Yelp Elite reviewers, or Beauty YouTubers in your area, consider inviting them to a free trial in exchange for an honest review—just make sure you’re ready to give them the white-glove treatment.
3. Optimize Content.
Experiment with content—including text messages, links, images, and videos. See what works the best for your audience and product, and then optimize to publish roughly 75 percent of your posts using that format. Never transition to 100 percent of one type of content, because platform algorithms change constantly, and your visibility may be affected if you’re posting content suddenly carries less weight. For every piece of content, make sure you include a call to action!
4. Make your content edgy.
What kind of content goes viral? Myth-busting, best-of lists, live event updates, “secrets of”, and contests…these types of content perform really well for most businesses and tease customers to click through to learn more. Increasingly, highly visual content, such as videos, are performing better, especially if they are funny or surprising. Make sure your content is eye-catching and offers something unique that customers want. If the content includes rewards and promotions (and it should), consider using an app that helps you build up your list with rewards. Opt-In Rewards, for example, makes it easy to run special promotions like discounts on your birthday on social media as well as via email, direct mail, and on your website.
5. Experiment with targeted advertising.
On some platforms it can be difficult to get noticed without sponsoring your updates. Try sponsoring your promotions to targeted audiences based on where your customers live, age, gender, or who they follow. For ideas on how to target your customers, check out Clover Insights. This free app will help you identify the demographics of your best customers or of the customers similar businesses in your area. You can find profiles of your existing customers and segment them. The better you get at segmentation, the more personalized and relevant your posts will be to customers, and the more effective it will be in getting a good response.
6. Partner with other small businesses.
Check out other local businesses online and occasionally share their content. Perhaps they would be open to a social media campaign where you co-promote your businesses and highlight your contribution or special role in the community.
7. Make it personal.
Customers can get their nails done anywhere. If all you are to the customer is the product, your business becomes a commodity. Make sure your messaging is personal. What makes your business truly unique? What do you stand for? How does your business connect to the community? Giving your business a face and a name makes it a personal experience for customers. Highlight your employees and their contributions on a regular basis with photos of their superb customer service, workmanship, or unique flair for their job. Another way to make your marketing more personal is to emphasize your connection to the community—do you give back? Encourage customers to partner with you to reach social goals like rebuilding the community after a storm or funding a local hospital. Are you where the local sports teams celebrate their wins? Share photos and congratulatory messages online. This type of content makes shopping with you memorable and a positive experience.
8. Integrate your marketing.
Whatever you’re doing to market your business, make sure to integrate it into your social media marketing plan. Your profile information (and a reason to join it) should be on every piece of marketing you send out. Use active language and benefits to joining your network such as: “Like us on facebook and get the latest promotions first” or “Retweet our Beauty Tips and enter for a chance to win a product upgrade.” One quick way to integrate your marketing is to accept orders within social media platforms. OrderEm, for example, allows customers to make purchases within facebook that sync to your Clover device.

That’s because the vast majority of shoppers–81% according to Advertising Week–research items online at least some of the time before making a purchase in a brick-and-mortar location.
What does this mean for small retailers? Even if your location isn’t yet e-commerce enabled, it still pays to provide an attractive, credible and easily searchable catalog of your offerings. Doing this can make you competitive and attractive to those consumers who like to research and browse before they buy.
It’s an important capability for any small business, and restaurants are no exception. This highly competitive sector is sometimes about satisfying very specific cravings—and other times about helping the undecided zero in on what they want.
Clover Online, which is evolving to provide a full suite of solutions to help small businesses manage the many dimensions of their online presence, has rolled out a new set of themes tailored specifically for restaurants. Here are four capabilities of Clover’s new restaurant websites that promise to provide a boost to food and drink merchants.
1. Automatically import inventory information
For Clover merchants, this is a convenient feature that ensures what appears to the customer is in harmony with what the restaurant has on hand. Automatic import makes it easy for restaurants to load their menu items quickly. And now that Clover Online is preinstalled for Clover merchants, this process is easier than ever.
2. Website designs specially made for your business
It isn’t just enough to be online. As a small business, you want to project credibility and professionalism with your online identity, just as you do with your brick-and-mortar location. Clover Online has designed themes that are specially made for restaurants, cafés, ice cream shops and even food trucks. The average consumer may not be able to name the latest trends in website design, layout and typography, but they know what feels modern when they see it. Having access to themes that represent the latest website design and user experience trends will make your site feel relevant, and that can help it resonate better.
3. Built with your customers in mind
Getting visitors to your website is one thing. But organizing it in such a way that visitors can find what they’re looking for in just few clicks is critical for converting visitors into customers. With your restaurant website, be sure to organize your menu items by categories that make sense; to highlight specialties and new menu items you want to move; and to make your site searchable so that visitors who know precisely what they want can find it easily. Clover Online offers categorization and search for your website as soon as you set it up.
4. Automatically works on mobile
According to Smart Insights, four out of five of U.S. internet users own a smartphone. What’s more, search engines like Google are making websites’ “responsiveness,” the quality that enables site content to render in a mobile-friendly layout, a key criterion in search ranking. That means having a mobile site is key both to getting found online, and to encouraging users to stick with your mobile site once they reach it. Clover Online stores are automatically mobile responsive, so restaurant merchants can rest assured that visitors are having a great website experience no matter how they’re accessing the restaurant’s online menu.
Restaurants require purpose-built website experiences. Clover Online’s new restaurant website templates make it simple for any restaurant merchant—neighborhood restaurant, coffee shop, food truck or other concept—to have a beautiful website that helps drive commerce to their location.

There’s probably no question with higher stakes for a small business owner. Luckily, an army of psychologists, marketers, and behavioral economists has studied this question. …",19-10-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-trends-research-roundup-getting-pricing-right/,"How do you decide how much to charge for your products? There’s probably no question with higher stakes for a small business owner. Get it wrong—charge too much or too little—and you’ll end up struggling to survive. Luckily, an army of psychologists, marketers, and behavioral economists has studied this question. Here’s what the research says about setting prices.
The basics
There’s a reason so many prices at so many stores end in 9’s—this simple psychological trick works. But the research shows that irregular prices work best for basic or “utilitarian” items. Luxury items sell better at round, even numbers. The Atlantic
When faced with three options, consumers tend to pick the middle one. If you have an item you want to push at a particular price point, try introducing a ‘bargain’ and ‘premium’ version above and below it, to steer customers to that ‘just right’ choice. The Atlantic
Shoppers tend to get overwhelmed when faced with too many similar choices. If you’ve got a group of similar products, try setting slightly different prices for each one, to help customers differentiate between them and ultimately make the decision to buy. Yale University’s School of Management
How to charge more
Attaching a narrative to an object makes people willing to pay more for it—even if they know the story is completely made up. If you want to charge more than the big-box chain down the road, try giving customers a little information about how your product was designed, where it comes from, or why it matters to you. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely
Mentioning time in advertisements and marketing materials also makes customers willing to pay more. Thinking about time seems to push consumers to think about the product as an experience, rather than just an object. Jennifer Asker, professor of marketing at Stanford Graduate School of Business
Creating bundles of different products can make spending more look like a bargain—but this trick only works if you also sell those items separately. In other words, people don’t want to be pushed to pay more. But you can, in fact, push them to pay more if you make them feel like savvy shoppers. Harvard Business School’s ‘Working Knowledge’
How to do discounts right
Customers tend to be price-sensitive for “non-urgent” products, like a book or something else they don’t necessarily need right away. Time-limited sales or flash discounts can help increase that sense of urgency and push people to buy. (And built-in options within your Clover POS make pushing out flash sales to your best customers easy.) WWW2017 Conference
Before you simply slash your prices, try offering more of a product for the same price—consumers tend to value this kind of promotion more than a discount, even if the math doesn’t work in their favor. (Hint: most people are bad at math.) The Economist
Understanding young shoppers
Millennials are very price-sensitive. And you’re not paranoid: they are checking Amazon for cheaper prices while they’re in your store. But loyalty programs, rebates, and creative promotions like an option to save by buying online and picking an item up in your store can all work to attract these bargain-hunters. Entrepreneur
They’re price-sensitive, but they’re also open to spending more on brands that allow them to express themselves or signal something aspirational about their lifestyle. This research suggests that branding is crucial to attracting younger customers—especially branding that highlights how unique, healthy, environmentally friendly, or luxurious your product is.

news_249,news,Product spotlight: Take the power of Clover POS on the go,"When you have a system in place, it can be hard to accept change. But adding a portable payments device to your hardware setup may streamline business tracking while increasing customer service. Read on to discover portable solutions from Clover.…",20-10-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/product-spotlight-take-power-clover-pos-go/,"Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance has sparked a lot of necessary changes in recent years to enable greater security for consumers while protecting merchants from the potential threat of fraudsters. As a result, many have updated their point of sale to the latest generation of hardware and software packages.
This change brings many small businesses into the 21st century, enabling them to customize their POS software to their business with never-before seen flexibility. But many merchants are unaware of just how much more this generation of hardware could be doing for their business.
Take Clover Mobile, for example. Being the big brother of the Clover portables set, Clover Mobile packs a lot of functionality into its small tablet-sized hardware. Built for speed and stability, Clover Mobile packs all the payment processing power of the countertop Clover into a portable, handheld set. In addition, Mobile can do everything its stationary parent unit can—track inventory, reward loyal VIPs, schedule employees, and more—from the convenience of a hand-held mobile unit.
Then there’s Clover Go. The most portable of Clover devices, Clover Go is a pocket-sized mobile payments solution for those looking to take their business on the road. Users can accept chipped and swipe payments as well as contactless solutions like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay, all with the safety, reliability, support, service, and protection of First Data.
Finally, there’s Clover Flex. Flex takes the portability of Clover Go and marries it with the feature set and durability of Clover Mobile to create a balance of portability, flexibility, and security. With a five-inch HD touch screen, built in barcode scanner and receipt printer, WiFi connection and 3G options, and a long lasting battery, you’re able to scan and manage inventory, print receipts and coupons, manage employee schedules, track sales data, and more, all while taking all of today’s chip, swipe, and contactless payments.
With so much power packed into each of these mobile point of sale machines, the opportunities are endless. With one of these machines at your side, you could improve the day’s receipts and improve your customer’s experience in any number of situations.
Delivery or catering service
If you deliver food to events, offices, or even homes, having a Clover portable allows you to take any form of electronic payment. The data—including gratuities—is immediately communicated to a main Clover terminal so that all transactions appear in your records without an extra step on your end.
Long lines at rush hour
Perhaps your business has a certain time of day when more customers need attention. To keep the line moving, you can send out a team member with a Clover portable to take orders and get the kitchen the information it needs to keep the line moving.
Mobile businesses
If you have a food truck, a mobile cafe, or a pop-up store, having a portable payments-processing device can be a life line. Clover portable devices can provide all the information you’d want to have—CRM database, inventory, and order tracking—no matter if you’re at a farmer’s market or a town bazaar. Wherever your business is, you have all of your information at your fingertips.
Seasonal spaces
Perhaps your business expands to include a patio or other space when weather permits. That can drastically increase your customer flow, so being prepared with portable devices is crucial. If your staff can meet the customers wherever they are without ferrying back to a central payments terminal, they’ll save time and energy that can be applied to other customers.
No matter which you choose, Clover Mobile, Clover Go, or Clover Flex, these portable devices make transactions easier for the customers and for you.

news_250,news,6 scheduling mistakes you’re making and how to fix them,"As a business owner you’ve got a lot on your plate, but that doesn’t have to mean you are prone to scheduling mistakes. If training and retraining more than you have to isn’t your idea of fun, it’s time to stop making these scheduling mistakes once and for all.…",23-10-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/6-scheduling-mistakes-youre-making-fix/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. 
As a business owner you’ve got a lot on your plate, but that doesn’t have to mean you are prone to scheduling mistakes. No matter the amount of employees you have on your payroll, scheduling is a big part of keeping them happy and reducing turnover. If training and retraining more than you have to isn’t your idea of fun, it’s time to stop making these scheduling mistakes once and for all.
1. Forgetting employee availability
You count on your employees to be there when you need them to keep your day-to-day operations moving seamlessly. But they also count on you to remember when they can’t work. If they tell you when they need to leave each day to pick up their kids or get to another job, you need to be able to remember. We’re all human and forgetting every once in awhile is inevitable, but that’s why getting technology involved is a top way to put an end to this scheduling mistake. Business owners have overflowing email inboxes and a desk that rebels against order, so entering employee availability into a system that will keep track of it all in one place is a major time saver. Whether this is an Excel spreadsheet or state of the art software is up to you, but either way, ensuring that you get scheduling right will set your business up for success.
2. Scheduling the wrong number of employees
An incorrect forecast can cost you. Having too many employees scheduled when customers are scarce will waste money and productivity when your employees run out of tasks. The opposite is also true; you don’t want there to be a line out the door because you underestimated the staff you’d need working that day. Keeping up with demand forecasts that are rooted in historical trends mixed with common sense will help you schedule correctly every time. And if you need help, we’ve got some tips for how to hire hourly employees.
3. Not having on-call employees
In the event that someone gets sick or a holiday rush hits your business early, you need to have employees you can call on. Whether these are regular employees whose availability you can look up quickly to determine their possible ability to come in on short notice, or they’re on-call employees who have flexible schedules, you need the ability to act quickly.
4. Making it difficult to swap shifts
There should be checks and balances to make sure your employees are swapping the correct shifts with coworkers in the corresponding roles. After all, approving a chef to get overtime to cover a cashier’s shift might not make sense. Speeding up the shift swapping process so that you will always be adequately staffed is a major way to avoid scheduling mistakes. If employees are within their allotted hours for the week and are switching to do a position they are trained for, then there should be no reason why the process shouldn’t be automated. Of course, a manager should make the last call on shift swaps, but the goal is to keep your business moving without additional emails, voicemails, or sticky notes cluttering your desk.
5. Not scheduling breaks
On an unusually busy day, you will be glad you have a break schedule. On those days, it’s easy for employees to work through breaks to handle the out of the ordinary demand. However, you want to make sure your employees have time to eat and recharge to keep them from burning out. It’s also pretty important to avoid legal issues that arise when employees don’t get the breaks they are entitled to. When you and your employees know when their breaks are, your day can run more smoothly.
6. Not rethinking schedules
A major scheduling mistake that could be taking a toll on your business is not rethinking schedules. Just because something worked well in the past doesn’t mean it will always serve your needs. Say a new hospital just opened down the street, your lunch hour business might have skyrocketed, meaning you need to add another person to that shift Monday through Friday. On the other hand, having employees start in intervals might be more cost effective than having them all start at once. Little changes to your schedule can have big impacts on your bottom line and productivity. Reconsidering your schedule periodically is a great way to maximize efficiency.
In scheduling, it always comes down to communication. And in 2017, employee scheduling requires businesses to keep the channels of communication open so they can collect availability, set schedules, and manage shift swaps in real time. Your market and business are changing at the speed of light, so keeping up and getting ahead require your process to run effortlessly in the background with minimal scheduling mistakes popping up. With the help of these six tips, you can have a few less things to worry about.

Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
Small businesses often depend on the holidays to lift annual sales and profits. With retail spending projected to grow up to 4 percent in 2017 versus last year, small businesses are gearing up for what should be a busy season.
For owners, that means they need a reliable team in place to handle the influx of customers, whether at the counter or on the ordering online. Delays or mistakes can jeopardize year-end results—especially when customers want in-store checkouts to be as seamless as the online experience, or expect knowledgeable employees to help them make buying decisions.
Should you hire temporary staff to meet demands? Are there incentives that would motivate employees to put in extra hours? What about dealing with inevitable scheduling problems, such as flu outbreaks or competing travel requests among staff?
Here are some tips for mapping out a staffing plan to capture holiday sales.
Size up your needs.
The first step is to figure out your revenue goals. Next, ensure there’s enough staff to make them a reality. Are you planning to ramp up marketing efforts, store hours, or menu offerings? How many people are required to do that?
By creating a detailed schedule—day by day, hour by hour—of who needs to do which tasks, small business owners can get a clear picture of what they’re up against and a roadmap for hitting performance targets.
Create a contingency plan.
It’s great when events unfold as anticipated. But, to paraphrase the well-known saying by poet Robert Burns, “The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” Preparing for problems ahead of time helps soften the impact.
Consider some scenarios: What if half the staff gets sick? What if everyone wants to go home for the holidays? What if something happens to you?
To fill potential gaps, put staffing solutions in place now, such as cross-training employees to work the grill and the register, offering bonuses to star employees to cover extra shifts, hiring college students planning to come home for winter break, or even creating an emergency menu—perhaps this is your event menu—that you can use to keep service running even when you’re lean on staff.
Empower employees to swap hours.
In study after study, employees of all ages, but particularly Millennials, report that they want flexible schedules. Scheduling software makes it easy for them to swap hours and better manage the holiday crunch, at the job and in their personal lives.
Swapping might entail trading shifts with a co-worker, or even giving up hours. While one person might relish the extra time off, another might jump at the chance for a bigger paycheck. The key to making this work is to make sure that you stay on top of who will be working and when.
Encourage people to step up.
The holidays can create prime conditions for testing promising employees. Is there a conscientious candidate who seems ready to advance to assistant manager? Find out if that person has what it takes to manage under stressful conditions.

There’s a well-worn adage that states, “You can’t know where you’re going until you know where you’ve been.”
As the holiday season rapidly approaches, it’s an appropriate thought for small businesses to bear in mind as they begin to undertake this year’s holiday planning.
In more specific business terms, understanding previous performance is an essential first step for setting intelligent goals. You can use elements of your own data and experiences, plus other information, to put yourself on solid footing.
With that in mind, this post will offer you a series of questions you should ask and answer as you review last’s year holiday performance. Answering them honestly and as accurately as you can will let you use this information to guide your holiday marketing, staffing, product and promotional ideas this shopping season. We’ll help you take a holistic look at last year with some qualitative and quantitative queries, along with questions that can help you think about longer-term business objectives and performance.
Let’s dive in.
Ask these qualitative questions about last year’s performance:

Did you feel prepared last year?
What do you recall about your and your staff’s level of ease (or frustration) during last year’s holiday season?

Reflect on your mindset prior to the 2016 holiday shopping season, and use those findings to power your motivation for boosting efficiencies this year. Thinking about your sense of your and your staff’s preparation for the holiday shopping season can help you determine the scope of changes you’ll need to make this year: will you launch an overhaul of your approach, or simply make tweaks that enable you to notch up your performance this year?
Ask these quantitative questions about last year’s performance:

How did you/your industry perform last year? Think in terms of gross revenue, gross profits, and holiday season monthly averages (November and December) versus rest-of-year average. Consider this your baseline goal.
What was you/your industry’s average number of daily transactions last year during the November/December holiday shopping season versus the rest of the year?
What was your/your industry’s average ticket size last year during the November/December holiday shopping season versus the rest of the year?

Understanding gross revenue is crucial, but having a handle on average transactions and ticket sizes is also key, because this information gives you a handle on which levers drove business for you and your competitors: high transaction volume, high transaction amounts, or a mix?
This information is your golden ticket to boosting performance this holiday season, and it isn’t as elusive as it might seem. Download the free Clover Insights app for iOS to find this data for specific types of business in your area.
But don’t stop there. Your goal shouldn’t just be to see a spike in one season based solely on holiday promotions. Knowing that the holidays are a great opportunity to build your business longer-term, your top goal should be converting that extra traffic of holiday shoppers into longer-term fans of your business.
Think about your specific goals in each of these areas:
Staying on top of the following metrics and activities can help you focus on hitting your holiday revenue goals while also translating holiday business activity into longer-lasting and profitable customer relationships.
Social media followers

Last year. How many social media followers did we gain, and as the result of which marketing efforts?
This year. How many social media followers do we want to gain during this year’s holiday season, and what is our plan to keep communication with them consistent when the season is over?

Email subscribers

Last year. How many email subscribers did we gain, and as the result of which marketing efforts?
This year. How many email subscribers do we want to get during this year’s holiday season, and what is our plan to stay in touch with them after the season is over so that those new relationships don’t go cold?

Gift cards

Last year. How many gift cards did we sell, if any, and what were our primary tactics for promoting them?
This year. How many gift cards do we plan to sell, and what is our plan to offer loyalty-building programs or products to shoppers who redeem them in-store in late December and beyond?

Loyalty programs

Last year. How many loyalty program signups did we get, and as the result of what types of marketing efforts?
This year. How many loyalty program signups do we plan to gain, and how do we follow up the holiday season with strategic loyalty offers that keep the momentum going?

Events

Last year. How many events, if any, did we book? Did they pay off in terms of revenue and the additional logistical work and staff required to make them successful?
This year. How many events are we targeting for this year, how will we determine which new faces have the highest potential to become regular customers, and how will we connect with them while they’re in our location?

Make sure your goals are realistic, and that you think about how they will serve both the holiday revenue opportunity and your longer-term business objectives.
Also make sure you create a step-by-step plan to achieve them. Stay tuned to this series for more tips about how to move the needle against your holiday business goals.

Consumer behavior watchers predicting that buyers would move to mobile en masse.
Today, it’s safe to say that consumers have shifted. People now spend more time consuming digital media on their phones than on their desktops.
Unfortunately, too many small business owners are operating steps behind this trend: 46% of small businesses don’t even have a website, let alone a mobile strategy. Consumers have a lot of buying options these days. They can get almost anything from Amazon and have it delivered within hours. If they want something more unique and handcrafted, Etsy has an app.
But you don’t have to be Amazon or Etsy to build a mobile presence and capture customers that like to shop with their phones. The technology required to get you into consumers’ pockets is getting cheaper and more user-friendly every day. With this in mind, here are five things you can do to build your business’s mobile presence:
Create an ecommerce store.
Consumers now make the majority of their purchases online, according to a recent survey by UPS. Only one in five purchases is currently made without using the internet at all.
The good news for small businesses is that setting up an online store can be cost effective and so simple that merchants can set them up all on their own, including importing products from their point-of-sale system into the store, setting up payments, and setting up shipping. For example, Clover Online enables small businesses to set up an ecommerce site that will look good on a desktop or a smartphone .
Create a mobile loyalty program.
A loyalty program can be an effective way to solidify relationships with newer customers, and a way to reward your best customers and give them incentives to keep coming back to your store.
Over the holidays, small businesses should consider two possibilities for using loyalty to get more revenue: launch your loyalty program before Thanksgiving so that you’re more likely to be considered for holiday shopping by loyalty members, or launch your loyalty program during the holiday so that shoppers have a reason to come back in January, when the giving season is over. Of course, merchants can layer both tactics to encourage shopping both during and after the holidays. Even a quick-serve business that doesn’t have much time to spend with each customer can build loyalty—and engage customers on their phones—with a system like this.
Make cash mobile
The Clover app CoinOut allows customers who pay with cash to choose to take their change virtually, saving it to a unique account, instead of going home with pockets full of nickels and dimes. Customers can manage their accounts from their phones. They can transfer their change to a bank account—or you can encourage them to save it up and turn it into a gift card, or donate it to a charity. A special charity appeal at the cash register could publicize the app and burnish your image with your best customers.
Use push notifications to drive foot traffic
Remember, consumers now make 38% of their purchases using a combination of in-person and online browsing and shopping. You can take advantage of this trend by pushing promotions, one-day deals, and other notifications to your customers’ phones in real-time. If you catch their attention while they’re out and about, running errands or checking Facebook on their lunch breaks, they may be more likely to stop by your store.
Get social. 
Macy’s and other major retailers have used social media campaigns to draw customers into their stores. There are a number of ways to get your customers to make your mobile marketing content for you. You could ask customers to post pictures of their office holiday parties featuring your special seasonal cookies, or have Santa make an appearance at your store to encourage people to share their pictures and wish lists. Reposting customer content with a link to your online store can create opportunities to turn “likes” into sales.
Mobile is where your customers are. They carry their smartphones wherever they go. They touch their phones many, many times a day. Shouldn’t some of those touches remind them to stop in and do some holiday shopping at your store?

Clover Rewards is free to merchants who use the Clover system, and from the customer side, it’s an app they can download to their phones and start redeeming their points right away.

For many small business owners the holiday season is the time of year when a singular goal becomes the driving force behind everything one does: use the big crowds to maximize revenue; get it while the getting’s good, so to speak.
But aside from the fact that there are simply more shoppers out and about, there’s one more interesting characteristic about the holiday season that many small business owners can be at risk of overlooking: the fact that during the holiday season, many small businesses will see a greater number of new customers walk through their doors than any other time of the year.
Knowing this, many savvy proprietors are implementing plans to capture those new faces and turn them into repeat customers throughout the coming new year. Given the fact that it’s cheaper to keep a current customer than bring in a new one, the holiday season is the perfect time to implement a new loyalty marketing program.
Below, we’ve outlined five steps to success in launching a loyalty program during the holiday season:

Invest in contemporary technology. Many SMBs think implementing a loyalty program is as simple as printing up some punch cards and a few table tents and calling it a day. But to compete on the level of national chains in the minds of the customer, consider investing in a mobile loyalty program. Fortunately, there are a number of affordable options in the marketplace today that bring the customer the convenience of never having to carry a card together with the measurability of an integrated, cloud-based system, offering proprietors the slick marketing capabilities and measurability needed to make an impact the bottom line.


Offer a signup incentive. When it comes to getting a holiday customer to perform a simple task, there’s often no better way than to offer them a little something for their effort. Cut through the dizzying array of holiday shopping activity in the customer’s mind by offering a worthwhile discount or a gift of real value to incentivize joining your loyalty program.


Determine points or punch. For many first-time loyalty marketers, deciding between a frequency-based (punches) or value-based (points) program can be a tough call. However, follow this rule of thumb that applies in most cases: for low-ticket, high-frequency businesses (coffee shops, pizza by the slice) choose punches to encourage more frequent trips. For higher-ticket, lower-frequency businesses (high-end boutiques, jewelry stores) go with points to encourage a larger spend per ticket per visit.


Promote your program. Sometimes, your marketing needs marketing if anyone’s going to hear about it–and that means getting creatively active on social, sending attractive, value-add email blasts, and going loud and proud about your program in-store. Imperative to a good loyalty marketing promotion is an enthusiastic group of engaged employees: in-store staff should be trained on the ins, outs, and benefits of the program and incentivized to sign up customers as frequently as possible in order to capitalize on that increased holiday foot traffic.


Use what you learn. Once you get your program up and running, you’ll be glad you sprung for today’s loyalty tech rather than some dusty old punch cards. Use your program’s dashboard to dig into analytics and see what’s working and what could be tweaked to your advantage. These analytics-based insights can help you adjust promotions, price points, and product offerings in the new year to capitalize on your new crop of regulars.

While the holiday season is certainly the time to implement programs and promo to bring as many new customers through the door as possible while maximizing their spend, don’t forget to capitalize on all those new faces by implementing a loyalty program. Putting in the loyalty marketing leg work during the busy holiday season can be the key to the holiday rush paying off recurring dividends well into the new year and beyond.

Make every new customer who walks through your door a regular customer that returns time and time again with Clover Rewards. Rewards connects you to customers through their mobile phones to draw them back to your business with special offers and rewards they’ll love.

Businesses that specialize in selling winter coats and outerwear are often left with not much to do in the spring and summer months. Perhaps a coastal restaurant is crammed to the gills during the go-go four months of summer tourist season, and scrambling to keep the lights on throughout the winter months.
Whatever part of the year a business goes through their “famine” phase, it can be possible to mitigate for the up-and, especially, -down periods they might face each year with some forethought and strategy.
While many proprietors do their best to squirrel away funds while the coffers are fat to save for those slow periods, the best laid plans can go awry, leaving many small businesses scrambling when the going gets tough.
Influential ad man Joseph Sugarman once wrote, “Each problem has hidden in it an opportunity so powerful that it literally dwarfs the problem. The greatest success stories were created by people who recognized a problem and turned it into an opportunity.”
So the key is to take the problem of seasonality and turn it into an opportunity. Below, we’ve outlined a few strategies to do so.
Launch an e-commerce site
Many small businesses have looked to the internet to lend a helping hand in bringing in revenue when times are tough. Remember our winter wear shop example from above? The one with nothing to do all summer long? Well it’s cold somewhere during the summer months. Perhaps the key to doing brisk business year round is putting up a Spanish language site optimized and localized for search in South America, where it’s winter during our summer months.
Reposition your business
Or maybe the key for our cold-weather proprietor is to offer a wider range of related products, like light jackets for spring and fall and even swimwear during summer. It’s not a stretch for a business to change from a winter coat shop to a year-round outwear provider—it’s just a matter of proper positioning.
Offer related products
Many small businesses deal with seasonality by offering related products that they can sell year-round. For example, many snowboard shops also offer skateboards, shoes, and apparel. Even though business for snowboards might fall off during warmer months, people skate year round.
Assess and re-deploy your assets in creative ways
Look at your business and its essential elements—each has value in its own way. The key to unlocking the potential of each element during down times is to look at how one might use them in other ways.
Having a lot of empty space in-store might make you the perfect venue for events—networking events, art shows, fashion shows, band release parties. Flex your network and your assets to your advantage to get the most out of your business year-round.
Develop a content strategy
Many businesses ramp up for back-to-school season and the busy holiday stretch. But if you’re the lone voice among your competitors who’s blogging year round, you just might get the jump on everyone else who’s not marketing. Develop a content calendar and blog and keep at it year round to pull in customers, clicks, and interest 24/7/365. If you don’t have the time to maintain a full blog, posting consistent content to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest or another social network that’s popular among your network can also work.
Whether it’s taking your business online, talking when no one else is, or pivoting into new product offerings and income streams, smart businesses know how to deal with seasonality proactively. The key to taking seasonality out of the equation is to look at your business from unique angles, and then capitalize on the opportunities you find.
Doing so just might mean the difference between “feast or famine” at your small business.

…",02-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-buying-franchise/,"Has the thought of running your own business ever crossed your mind? At the same time, have the thoughts of the hurdles involved in creating a business from scratch shut down that dream? If you answered yes to both of those questions, owning a franchise business might be for you. This post is designed to help would-be franchisees evaluate their decision to jump in by answering five enlightening questions. It’s also here to equip those merchants who do decide to buy a business with advice and tips that help them do so in the smartest way possible.
1. Do you know what you want?
A quick Google search will reveal there are a lot of franchise opportunities out there—and we mean A LOT. That’s why it’s important for you to take some personal inventory before performing your search. Finding out more about what you’re actually looking for by filtering it through who you are can be an invaluable first exercise. Ask yourself some questions like “what are some of your dominant personality traits?” “Do you have any relevant special skills?” “Do you gravitate towards any particular line of business and why?” “What kind of experience do you have?”
Honest self assessment can go a long way in helping you match your search of possible franchise opportunities with who you are as a possible business owner.
2. Do you have control issues?
When it comes to buying a franchise, we’ve already established that some introspection is a good thing. This question digs a little deeper into one specific area. Becoming a franchisee, while it may seem like you’re owning your own business (and you are, for all intents and purposes), you’re going to be bound by a lot of rules and regulations that you HAVE to abide by. As a franchisee, your role will be to implement what the franchisor dictates: operating policies, store look and feel, products and services offered. All of that and more will be set in stone for you from day one. If you’re the free-wheeling type who has a hard time following the rules, then buying a franchise might not be for you.
3. What’s your tolerance for risk?
There’s a popular myth when it comes to franchises. It states that franchises are a much surer thing compared to starting up a small, privately owned business. Perpetuators of this myth claim that franchises only fail 5% of the time. Sadly, that number is low. The actual number is closer to 33% for franchises open for 2 years. And the number jumps up to 50% for franchises open for 5 years. So, ask yourself, are you prepared to embark on what’s essentially a 50/50 proposition? This is the reality of buying a franchise. It’s not for the squeamish or easily dissuaded or discouraged.
4. How’s your cash flow?
After you’ve identified the right franchise that meets your requirements for personality and risk tolerance, you have one more big question to answer—finances. Before anything happens, you have to prove a certain level of net worth before a franchisor will even consider you as a candidate. Once that’s established, you can begin to examine the long list of costs that will impact your cash flow. (And this isn’t even taking into account the obvious up-front expenses of franchise fees and equipment.) Marketing and advertising costs, grand opening fees, licensing, products and supplies, insurance, employee salaries…the list goes on and on. Take a good, hard look at your assets and liabilities before making your decision to buy a business. You can also refer to the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) to help you identify all of the cost concerns and legal considerations you’re going to need to take into account.
5. Say you get the franchise. Then what?
The ink is dry on the contract. What’s next? It’s time to figure out how to run your business as efficiently and effectively as possible. One of the biggest considerations in making that happen will be identifying the right point-of-sale system. And that’s where Clover can help. With a slew of productivity apps built into the devices, you’ll be able to hit the ground running with the same type of HR, operations, marketing, and analytical support that the “big boys” already rely on.
Don’t forget that Clover’s suite of devices also helps franchise businesses launch with world-class, fully-flexible payments, from mobile to tableside and beyond. Doing your due diligence with your POS system can save you tons of headaches in the future. It’ll also help free up your time to consider training for employees, enable your team to build rapport with customers and much more. It’s an investment that will pay for itself several times over within mere months.
Good luck with your assessment as you explore franchise opportunities and remember to refer to this business advice and tips in order to help you be successful.

While it may seem like technology is everywhere, the National Restaurant Association reports that only one in 10 restaurateurs consider their operations to be “leading edge” when it comes to technology, and one-third feel they are lagging.
Eighty-one percent of restaurateurs say their restaurant uses a POS system. But half of those systems don’t feature any way for them to process payments and gain a 360-degree view of their restaurant operations, in real-time, anywhere. Restaurateurs all over the country are upgrading their point-of-sale technology to meet their needs and solve their challenges.
Whether you’re upgrading or seeking a restaurant management platform for the first time, the perfect POS should deliver four values in your experience with it: reliability, ease of use, support, and training.
Reliability
Your point-of-sale is going to be the heart of your business. You don’t have time for an outage in software that could cost your business hundreds or thousands of dollars in lost customers. But unfortunately, those types of outages and disruptions can happen.
With that in mind, a restaurant POS should provide an Offline Mode capability. This ensures your service is able to operate normally if connectivity is lost. Offline Mode is automatically triggered whenever the system senses a loss of connectivity. During this time, your experience with the POS does not change, and your guests’ experience with your restaurant does not either. You can open and close checks, fire off orders to the kitchen, print receipts, collect payments, adjust tips … all the critical functions for the restaurant
Easy to use
Nowadays, best-in-class restaurant POS systems are designed so that if you can use a smartphone, you can use a POS. That’s the kind of technology you should be using in your restaurant.
Believe us, this isn’t a “nice to have” difference. It adds significantly to your margins, employees’ productivity and the experiences of your guests. You’ll save time training, there will be less room for error and building guest loyalty is easier than ever with built-in restaurant analytics in modern restaurant POS software.
POS support
Your restaurant doesn’t operate on a nine-to-five schedule, and neither should the support it receives. When something is off, you don’t have time to wait for an appointment or for the next “business day,” and you certainly don’t want to pay an extra fee.
Support is an experience that should not be undervalued but can be misunderstood. Legacy point-of-sale providers often charge for the ability to call for basic troubleshooting, and restaurant owners have estimated that fees can climb north of $2,000 a year.
Modern restaurant POS providers typically take a different approach, offering support as part of their service. This means basic support services don’t come at a cost that racks up month after month. Plus, their support call center will be open 24/7/365. Yes, that includes holidays.
Most solutions will offer a version of this support, but there are areas you can dig into. Top-tier providers will assign a dedicated account manager to your restaurant, and may offer in-app chat from the mobile app and a variety of channels for support: phone, email, chat and more. Be sure to inquire about what you’ll get to ensure the best experience.
Training
Anyone who has ever trained restaurant staff knows it can be time-consuming, disruptive and costly. In fact, one of the major hesitations for upgrading restaurant POS software has to do with training. When you are evaluating a POS system, you’ll want to consider how the system you select can speed up the learning curve by offering you an experience that is intuitive and easy to use.
Training represents a real, but often hard-to-measure, cost to the business — particularly in an industry with high employee turnover. Thus, ease of use and restaurant-specific design are essential when it comes to training.
Look for a restaurant POS that can provide you with a Training Mode function. This allows your staff to train on a terminal and learn the features of the POS while using your data and menu, without impacting your reports or service.
At the end of the day, having a restaurant POS provider that gives you the experience you deserve is the difference between paying for a service and paying for real value.

…",07-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-clover-app-market-november-2017/,"Thousands of small businesses rely on their Clover point-of-sale systems to safely process orders and keep track of sales data. But most merchants boost their system with a vast array of apps that simplify and automate tasks.
Turn to the Clover App Market for apps that help you manage schedules, speed up deliveries, set up ecommerce sites, keep popular items in stock, seat customers more quickly, and much more. Every app is designed to lighten your load—no steep learning curve or configuration hassles, ever.
Here are three versatile apps that dramatically reduce the headache of inventory, purchasing, and customer ordering. Whether you own a restaurant or retail store, these tools will save you time and effort—immediately.
MarketMan
Wouldn’t it be great to focus on your restaurant’s final product instead of all the back-end work required to put in on the table?
Consider this startling fact: most restaurants spend two hours a day figuring out what they need to purchase and then manually filling those orders. That means endless phone calls, paperwork, tracking costs…and fixing errors.
MarketMan can do all the busywork for you. Designed for food and beverage businesses of every kind, the cloud-based app helps you control inventory, procurement, and accounting, while continually monitoring and improving profitability.
With MarketMan, you get a wealth of data and functions at your fingertips. The app lets you stay on top of inventory, track the cost of goods sold, receive alerts when an item is low, compare prices among vendors, place orders, handle delivery reconciliation, identify waste patterns, organize orders and invoices, calculate recipe costs, recognize when a menu item becomes less profitable, and more.
Try it out with a 30-day free trial, and see how quickly you can slash ordering and invoicing time, and even lower your food costs.
Springboard Retail
When you’re ambitious, one store is rarely enough. However, scaling up into additional locations or adding e-commerce options comes with unique challenges.
One of the biggest obstacles is maintaining control over a sprawling operation. What are people ordering at each location? How much stock do you have on hand? What do you need to purchase or move to another location?
Springboard Retail brings order to a growing enterprise. The app was developed for specialty retailers by retailers, who drew on firsthand experience trying to track inventory and sales across multiple stores and channels.
With a glance at the dashboard, you get real-time data on a customer’s frequency and average spend, daily sales, margins, returns, and transfers. You can generate reports for specific vendors, styles, sizes, brands, and inventory across all stores. You can even use data for your marketing efforts, segmenting customers and tailoring messages to reach each group.
Springboard Retail quickly improves your inventory management, purchasing and receiving, sales and ordering, and customer relationship management—and keeps an expanding business on track.
Sounddog with AirMenu
Large, busy restaurants can be loud and hectic—difficult conditions for meeting customers’ needs. Without a large wait staff, dining experiences often fizzle.
What if you could heighten that experience, while also increasing tabs and lowering costs? One mobile app makes it all possible.
Sounddog turns personal smartphones into interactive tools for placing orders, engaging customers, broadcasting specials, boosting ticket sizes with photos of food and drinks, and—for sports-themed establishments in particular—listening to the restaurant’s televisions.
Here’s how it works. Once customers download the app to their smartphones, they can select items from an enticing, picture-filled menu, and place orders wherever they are, whether at the table or offsite for pick-up. Alternately, servers can use their phones to send orders to the kitchen—a fast, inexpensive solution.
But ordering is not all that Sounddog does. For customers who want to watch a sports game or other programming, a TV option lets them select the station they want to hear through a dedicated WiFi network. No more straining through ambient noise and full-throated roars to watch a preferred station or game.
Additional functions let customers collect rewards, coupons, and access to specials and events—proven relationship-building features that you can activate from your customer dashboard.
Check out these and other apps at the Clover App Market, and find new ways to improve the business and free up valuable time.

Read all posts in the series here on the Clover blog.
For most businesses, traffic naturally ebbs and flows throughout the day. Some times of day are extremely busy; others are very slow.
But just as with nature, smart people can undertake a little engineering to create a more optimal version of existing circumstances. Even businesses like nightclubs or breakfast cafes, which are often created to cater to customers at a specific time of day, can try tactics that might bring in more customers during off hours. It takes creativity, intentionality, and insight into what makes your business and customers tick.
Offer deals. 
Boost traffic above marginal numbers by offering a benefit to come in during slow hours. Happy hours, early bird specials, and senior discounts are just a few examples of popular deals that work well.
These types of deals are not restricted to the food industry. Thee town of Denton, Texas, for example, has a downtown retail “happy hour” on Wednesdays to help revitalize all the businesses in that community, across the spectrum of business types. Check in with the local chamber of commerce and neighboring businesses to see if this is a possibility in your locale. If not, you can always test it out in your location.
Along those lines, take some time to visit other stores in your area during non-peak hours. Figure out which ones are busy and why. Clover’s free Insights app can help you see aggregate information on other businesses in your area, based on business types you choose, to help you figure out which businesses are worth investigating.
Slow time, large parties. 
Slow times are also ideal for hosting larger parties. To bump your traffic during this time, consider marketing your business to local office buildings and organizations as a location to host anniversaries, town halls, board meetings, baby showers, birthday brunches, retirement parties, and more. Connect with local groups, such as the Lion’s Club, Red Hat Society, Toastmasters, and alumni groups, to see if they’re interested in off-hour group discounts.
Retail shops can also participate: consider offering private shopping parties and other events. North Carolina-based Blissful Boutique, for example, offers a “Sip & Shop” party where customers can drink cocktails while shopping with friends. Private fittings where customers know they will get your full attention can be attractive to service-minded customers, and help cultivate a base of loyal patrons.
Flash deals. 
Email, social media and mobile text messages can be wonderful tools to promote flash sales. You can send notifications to people in the vicinity, or to loyal customers offering sale prices, or just an enticing message such as, “Free coffee for the next hour with bagel purchase.” These messages prompt people to visit in real-time, and create an urgency that might propel them through your door. SMS Marketing, for example, not only sends out offers via text, it allows you to market to people based on their purchasing history.
Switch up the offerings. 
Sometimes getting people in the door during off hours is just a matter of adjusting the products or services to appeal to new demographics.
Adding a kids’ menu, for example, may help bring in customers earlier in the dinner hour when families are more likely to be out. Late night menus that are scaled back to accommodate customers when there’s likely to be less staff also help. Offering specials for dietary restrictions can open up a whole new market. This type of promotion can also be done for retail businesses. Maternity stores that offer free water, a clean bathroom, and nursing areas have tailored their store to meet the unique needs of their customers. Stores with play areas or pet-friendly sections appeal to different types of customers. Visit stores similar to yours in a different area to get ideas for new products, services or menu mixes to try.
Offering creative new products and services that complement your business and attract customers during off-hours can help you bolter overall revenue. For more ideas, read “Using insights to borrow business-building ideas from your competitors.”

news_263,news,"Crowd pleasers: 8 smart, affordable ideas to deepen customer loyalty","As we round the corner into the holiday season, get creative and show your customers how much you appreciate their loyalty! A little love goes a long way with these low-cost ideas. 
…",09-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/8-smart-affordable-ideas-to-deepen-customer-loyalty/,"There’s a lot going on in the world right now. It’s been a long year, and a little kindness goes a long way—especially when it comes to customer loyalty. As you might know, existing customers spend 67% more than new customers. Hence, ‘tis the season for reminding your customers that you appreciate them!
There are loads of ways merchants can show they care without having to lavish big bucks on their customers. Loyalty programs, customer satisfaction surveys, and rewards are all easy ways to give back to your biggest fans. But, if you’re trying to run a tight ship, consider these creative, low-cost ideas to boost customer loyalty!
1. Pets are customers too!
They may not be paying customers, but showing pets some love can earn you loyalty for life. Set out treats and water for furry friends and customers will take notice. This is also a great way to drive foot traffic through your door when potential new fans are out for a walk!
2. Offer babysitting
No, not actually babysitting—that might be creepy. But you can entertain the little ones while the rest of the family shops around! Have some fun activities to distract kids while their parents get through their list. Scavenger hunts, games, puzzles, even just an area where kids can color might give parents a little peace of mind.
3. Send holiday cards
A handwritten note goes a long way, even if it does seem a little old school! Reach out to your customers with a cheery card or thank you just in time for the holidays. If celebrating the season isn’t your style, send handwritten notes throughout the year to recognize special events: a birthday, job promotion, or new addition to the family. That you took the time to sit down and write something is exponentially more meaningful than an automated email.
4. Clover Rewards
Loyalty programs don’t have to be big budget items. Clover Rewards is free to merchants and gives you the tools to offer simple, low-cost rewards to your customers. It’s also a great way to build a relationship with customers on-the-go, as it connects with a customer’s mobile. With this link, you gain the opportunity for other surprise-and-delight treats, like the free Clover app Promos. Create instant, in-the-moment mobile specials: think a free candy bar on Halloween or a free hot chocolate on the coldest day of the year.
5. Spotlight on social
Not into the handwritten cards idea? Give your best customers a shout-out on social! Let them know how much they mean to you. Keep it personal, sincere, and shareable. Twitter and Facebook can be both customer service and customer retention tools, so don’t limit yourself to marketing campaigns on those platforms. Plus: posts are free!
6. Put on a VIP event
VIP events don’t have to be pricey. Put on an invite-only after-hours event in your store, and invite your frequent customers! Especially during the holiday season, some extra time to shop after normal store hours will be greatly appreciated. You can make it feel like a real VIP event by adding snacks, drinks, and a rockin’ playlist.
7. When in doubt: snacks.
Remember in college when professors would offer free pizza at study sessions? The same principle applies here. Feed them and they will come! Offer cookies or other treats in your store for hangry shoppers. If your business is based online, surprise your customers with treats in the mail.
Running a restaurant? You can still get on the free stuff train. One fascinating study found big power in the humble after-dinner mint: waiters received a 21% better tip when they left two free mints at the end of the meal. Alternately, a jewelry store in Danbury, Connecticut gave out free carnations to any women who stopped in—regardless of whether or not they purchased anything.
8. Random acts of kindness
Falling under the surprise and delight category, randomly covering someone’s purchase or comping them a free lunch is one of the most powerful things you can do. Instead of paying it forward—where customers pay for other customers—give your customers something for free. That kind of karma will last a lifetime.

news_265,news,How to turn your social media followers into customers,"Your business has an account on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and beyond…but are you able to convert those social media followers into customers?.…",17-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/turn-social-media-followers-customers/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. 
Your business has an account on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and beyond… but are you able to convert those social media followers into customers?
1. Ask questions of your followers
Engagement is the name of the game if you want to convert social media followers into customers. The same goes for friends on your birthday; the ones who you talk to often are much more likely to show up to your birthday party, compared to your first Facebook friend from 10 years ago who you haven’t talked to since.
Want to remodel a store or thinking of adding something new to your menu? Ask your social media followers! Your loyal followers know your business inside and out and can generate some great ideas. If you decide to go with their new dish or seating layout, be sure to give them credit by thanking them on the social media site on which they made their suggestion.
If you already have a few ideas and want to validate or debunk your hypothesis, set up a poll on Twitter to get feedback in a more structured way. Be a good friend to your followers, the kind that listens and checks in often to convert social media followers into customers.
2. Offer social media exclusive discounts
Everyone loves a discount, especially when they feel they are being rewarded for something. Following a company on social media certainly doesn’t take a whole lot of effort, and offering an extra incentive to continue following in the future doesn’t hurt. Figure out which social media site is most effective for you (most followers, most comments, most reshares, etc) and create an offer that customers can’t pass up.
Maybe you run an ice cream shop and create an appealing graphic for Instagram with a buy-one-get-one-half-off on a day when a heatwave is predicted. Have each person who comes in for the promotion pull up the image and show that they’re following you to redeem it. You could even point your followers on other social media sites to your Instagram to gain more followers and traffic on the day of your promotion. The key here is to keep it simple and be as specific as possible. When your customers know exactly what they need to do to get the offer, it will make it a lot more likely that they will take the actions you set out.
3. Get holiday specific
If you go on social media often, it seems like every single day there’s a new “holiday” popping up. From national best friend’s day to international beer day, if there’s a way to fit what you do in with the holiday, then do it! Keep track of what holidays are coming up (traditional or on the newer side) and plan promotions accordingly. The easiest way to do that is with Clover’s monthly installments of its promotional calendars like this one.
On national best friend’s day you could ask your followers to bring their best friend into your donut shop for a buy-one-get-one-free deal on a popular item on your menu if they check in or post a picture together. This is a great way to stay current and experience the benefits of these growing holidays.
4. Create contests
Just like everyone else, your customers love free stuff. When trying to convert social media followers into customers, what better way is there than to give them a little something for free? Giving out your products free to anyone who shows up is asking to move you from the black into the red, but having a contest that creates buzz about your business and gives away a few things is a great alternative.
As mentioned in the social media exclusive offer section above, the key is to be as specific and simple as possible. Make sure your instructions spell out exactly what followers need to do to qualify to enter your contest. Do they need to follow you, repost the image with a certain hashtag, and tag a set number of friends? Determine what’s best for boosting your followers in a way that incentivizes them to also make it into one of your locations. That way, when you pick a winner, they’ll be happy to share their positive experience with you and encourage their friends to do business with you as well.
5. Be helpful
You are an expert in your field, to say the least. That means you have endless knowledge to pass on to your followers and customers, beyond just the products you sell. Highlight unique tips you might have that relate to what you sell on your social media profiles. You could even offer classes or workshops at one of your locations that could help turn social media followers into customers. Millennials in particular can’t get enough of experiences, as 72% said they planned to up their spending on experiences.
Beyond that, answer questions from followers to show that you’re listening. If you use Hootsuite, or another social listening tool, you could stay on top of what people are saying about your business and step in when someone is having an issue or repost their content (with permission!) when someone is singing your praises.
With a little bit of effort, you could take your followers and turn them into lifelong customers. These are just a few ideas and we welcome you to share any strategies that have worked for you in the past in the comment section.
Once you’re able to convert social media followers into customers, you’ll need a happy workforce to greet them. Boost employee satisfaction and retention with employee scheduling and time tracking from Homebase, which integrates with all Clover point of sale systems.

news_266,news,Business scenario: Negotiating a lease renewal,Rent is one of the largest expenditures for business and can make a huge difference in terms of profitability. Here are 10 tips for re-negotiating your lease.…,20-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-negotiating-lease-renewal/,"Rent is one of the largest expenditures for small businesses and can make a huge difference in your profitability and long-term viability. Re-negotiating lease agreements should therefore be an annual event where you make sure the business lease terms still fit in with your overall business strategy and plan. Take time to engage with these 10 important steps before renewing your commercial lease.
1. Re-evaluate your retail store business plan.
Before opening your doors, you likely put together a business plan and strategy that made several assumptions. Now that you’ve been in the location for some time you have a good sense of how much that location can bring you in terms of revenue as well as the costs of doing business in that area.
2. Don’t be afraid to counter-offer lease terms.
Every time you renew a lease, all terms are up for renegotiation. Monthly rent is the most obvious clause to renegotiate, but it’s not the only one. If the location rocks, but the bathroom is an embarrassment, try negotiating a bathroom makeover or needed repairs. If the rent is fair, but the windows are drafty, negotiate for the landlord to pay the heating bill or fix the windows. Remember: Everything is negotiable.
3. What do you offer the landlord (besides rent)?
In every business arrangement, there are intangibles. Landlords value good tenants. Are you timely with your payments? Do you have a strong credit history? Are you a low risk? Do you bring in business for surrounding businesses, or are other tenants complaining about you?
4. Investigate what your neighbors pay.
It often costs landlords more to get a new tenant than it does to keep a good tenant. For example, new tenants often demand tenant finishes—walls repainted, minor construction, or new carpeting. If you’ve paid your rent on time and have been a good tenant, odds are the landlord will want you to stay and would be willing to offer some tenant finishes.
Research other locations and use them as your BATNA—your Best Alternative to Negotiating an Agreement with the current landlord. If there are comparable locations available, what would it cost to move? Can you use the threat of moving to reduce your current monthly rent? Can you cap yearly increases? Is it necessary to give additional security deposits for each year you remain in a location, or can this be waived? Knowing your best alternatives to the current lease helps you make sure you aren’t taken advantage of.
5. Keep your options open.
Many merchants focus on re-negotiating the rental fees and aren’t paying enough attention to the other clauses in the lease. Be wary of clauses that limit your ability to do business. For example, are you allowed to sublet space if you decide to partner with another business or need to close suddenly? Are there restrictions on your space that you can ask to be lifted such as closing time, whether you can expand your business onto the sidewalk, or what services you may provide? Can you request exclusive rights to the building for your services or radius restrictions? Are the termination rights fair and favorable to you?
6. Verify the details.
Your lease says how many square feet of space you’re renting—is it accurate? Measure all the usable areas of the space and make sure you’re not overpaying.
7. Look beyond the retail space.
Investigate ways to sweeten the deal for yourself. For example, landlords often have more than one property in an area and it’s possible he can offer additional perks. Ask the landlord to give you more value as part of the lease. Perhaps there is additional storage space available for your inventory or additional parking spaces nearby for customers. Can the landlord offer additional signage on the building or nearby to increase the visibility of your business? Adding perks to your business lease terms can make a big difference to discoverability and accessibility to your business.
8. Renegotiate the mandatory insurance.
Hidden in the legalese is often an insurance clause. Typically, landlords require additional insurance to protect themselves against lawsuits. Rental lease language is often written to favor the landlord, and it’s possible that the landlord requires the same insurance for all their renters regardless of the type of business or real risk. Question this clause and offer to purchase only insurance that is reasonable and makes sense for your type of business. Once the lease is signed the insurance costs become a fixed cost of doing business and are worth negotiating.
9. Escalation and arbitration clauses.
Is it clear who is responsible for what? Do you know how disagreements will be handled? Is the lease valid in your state, or will you have to find a lawyer in another state to represent you if there are problems? Read every clause.
10. Write it all down.
Create a written Request for Proposal with your demands. Include the desired lease term, requested improvements and finishes, additional perks, changes to property use requirements.

news_267,news,One less job for merchants with point-to-point encryption security update,PCI compliance is one of the most critical set of tasks small business owners must undertake.…,20-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/one-less-job-for-merchants-with-point-to-point-encryption-security-update/,"Among the reasons people start businesses–the challenge of building something from scratch, opting out of a traditional 9-to-5, being one’s own boss–managing PCI compliance is almost surely not one of them. But that doesn’t stop it from being one of the most critical set of tasks small business owners must undertake.
All merchants that accept payment cards must be PCI compliant. Some rules are technical, some pertain to physical security practices, others are process- and procedure-driven. All of the rules are meant to ensure the security of customers’ card-based payments. The consequences of ignoring PCI compliance are too great for small businesses to ignore.
Consider that, according to the PCI Security Standards Council, 7 in 10 hackers attack businesses with 100 employees or less, and that the average cost of a breach to small businesses is more than $20,000–a significant burden to many businesses.
To add to the burden, if your business experiences a security breach and is found to not be PCI compliant, you may risk higher processing fees, be penalized with an assessment, or jeopardize your relationships with your bank and credit card companies.
And of course, failing to be PCI compliant means you’re putting your customers at risk, which can put your business’s reputation at risk, in turn.
Enter point-to-point encryption, or P2PE
Clover’s point-of-sale systems are already among the most secure in the industry with built-in PCI technology that secures credit card transactions.
But even with a PCI-compliant Clover point-of-sale device, merchants must still implement a number of additional security controls to secure customer transactions. Merchants also have to complete a yearly self-assessment in order to validate their PCI compliance. The longest of those assessments has 300-plus questions.
Enter point-to-point encryption, or P2PE. This technology further ensures the security of card-based transactions. With P2PE, card data is encrypted–rendered unreadable by cyber thieves or anyone else–from the moment it touches the Clover point-of-sale system to the moment the data reaches the servers at TransArmor, First Data’s card security solution.
This reduces the scope of individual activities and controls merchants need to account for themselves in order to secure payments, making the security environment for those merchants’ customers even more ironclad.
In order for a point-of-sale system to be classified as P2PE, it must undergo a rigorous assessment and be approved by the PCI Security Standards Council. Clover is among the point-of-sale solutions that has passed this rigorous test. Customers who are currently using Clover Mobile, Clover Mini and Clover Flex to process payments have P2PE on their devices already, and it will become available on other Clover devices in the future.
One less job
P2PE reduces the number of merchant-implemented controls required to secure card transactions with encryption technology. And at the end of the year, it reduces the number of annual PCI validation questions merchants must answer to affirm their compliance by as much as 90 percent.
What’s more, P2PE also addresses compliance for mobile payments.
In short, point-to-point encryption of card transactions gives both merchants and their consumers more protection, all while reducing the assessment and compliance burden. No matter why they started their businesses, any business owner would welcome the advantages of P2PE technology: less time on paperwork, more time to run the business, greater protection for customers and one less thing to worry about.

5. Your customers are truly fantastic.

You love your best customers. These are the people who help you keep the lights on, refer you to new customers, and will always stay loyal. Your customers are your bread and butter (potatoes and gravy?), and that’s something special.

Your employees bring your business to life each and every day—they might even dress in a turkey suit if you ask them. While it can be hard to delegate—and sometimes your team might drive you crazy—you know your business would be nowhere without their help and dedication.
It’s easy to get so focused on your business that you forget to be thankful for what you’ve achieved. Take a moment before the holiday shopping seasons hits to appreciate everything you’ve built! Enjoy some turkey and stuffing with an extra helping of pie: you’ve earned it.

news_270,news,Growing pains: Managing cash flow,"Most people hate to talk about money. But when you’re a small business owner, cash flow is a constant worry. Find out about Clover apps that lighten the load by tracking money in and out, covering gaps with cash advances, and stopping leaks that drain the business. …",28-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-managing-cash-flow/,"Most people hate to talk about money. But when you’re a small business owner, financial worries are nearly always on your mind.
Paying for rent, utilities, payroll, inventory—even in a thriving business, trying to meet expenses can be tough, and stressful. When more money is going out than coming in, it’s urgent that you find ways to generate more cash to cover temporary gaps, put controls in place to better track sales and expenses, and stop preventable leaks that can drag the business down.
Clover’s family of pre-loaded and for-purchase apps can help. Check out these options in the Clover App Market for solving even the most persistent cash flow problems.
Get quick cash infusions.
Did you know that you can apply for working capital using the Clover POS system?
For Clover customers, Clover Capital is a fast, hassle-free solution for getting your hands on capital. Rather than dealing with a bank, simply log in to your Clover station, fill out a one-page form, and hit submit.
Once approved, you’ll see cash in your account in just 5 to 7 days. Cash advance amounts are based on average monthly Visa/MasterCard processing, which means you won’t get stuck with payments you can’t support as determined by your sales history.
Not only is applying fast and easy, but it’s low risk as well. Small business owners repay the advance daily through merchant processing—turning future credit card sales into ready cash now.
Manage your money better.
Too often, cash flow problems are a result of weak oversight. Fortunately, it’s easy to improve your money-management skills using free apps you can launch from the Clover web dashboard.
Reporting, for example, automatically tracks day-to-day payments received, items sold, discounts given, and taxes paid. It keeps you on top of the finances and helps avoid tight squeezes.
Getting control of the actual cash coming into the business is another way to ease problems. Cash Log is a free app that tracks cash transactions, including all cash drawer activities such as adding or removing bills and coins.
Merchants get a clear picture of all the sales, not just credit cards transactions, including who handled each payment, refund, or bank deposit—a great tool for monitoring cash flow.
To get a bird’s-eye view of the business, Insights uses graphs and charts to tally total sales, average ticket size per guest, peak sales hours, customer trends, and more. Having accurate data lets you fine-tune the business and plan ahead for the future.
Protect against fraudulent chargebacks.
Another strategy to ensure healthy cash flow is to stop letting money escape. Take credit card chargebacks. In best-case scenarios, customers with valid complaints about shoddy goods and services or billing errors can dispute the charges—and they usually win under the terms of the federal Fair Credit Billing Act.
But for small business owners, chargebacks can be a burden. While disputes were intended to be a last resort, the process is so easy that some customers use it to get their money back and keep the merchandise—a scam known as “friendly fraud.”
Chargeback Fighter is a powerful app that helps merchants contest chargebacks. Using the customer-facing Clover Mini or Clover Mobile, the app takes a photo at the time of each credit card transaction. Transaction information and customers’ photos are sent to merchants via email or stored in the Cloud—compelling evidence to help win more claims.
Try out a free sample version, and find out how it works to keep hard-earned cash in hand.
Ramp up employee monitoring.
No one likes to think that staff is cheating them. But employee theft is a common occurrence. The US Retail Fraud Survey identified it as the single biggest cause of loss to retailers, topping paperwork errors, shoplifting, and supplier fraud as the number-one culprit behind “shrinkage.”
Cash Track adds a strong control function over the finances. Here’s how it works: At the beginning of a shift, merchants can record how much cash has been assigned to each employee and register, then monitor cash on hand as the shift progresses. At the end, you can reconcile the employee’s count and your count—an easy way to spot irregularities.
Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business. Protecting incoming money, improving financial management, and tapping cash to tide you over are three ways to keep the business humming…and rest easier at night.

news_271,news,MVP: 5 Clover apps every food truck needs,Loving the food truck life but tired of struggling with missed sales opportunities and operational challenges? Discover the five must-have Clover apps that can help you ensure success is always on the menu for you mobile food truck.…,29-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/mvp-5-clover-apps-every-food-truck-needs/,"If you’re running a mobile food truck business, you’re probably living your dream—serving your favorite foods to adoring customers in a one-of-a-kind setting. But, even though your situation is unique, you do share some commonalities with others who also operate food trucks. There seem to be certain pain points and operational challenges that are universal in the food-service industry. This post will take a look at a few of each found in the mobile food business—along with a few apps available for your Clover POS software system that can help them go away.
Let’s start by looking at some common pain points in the food-service industry. One we see a lot is missed sales opportunities, including upsells and pre-ordering. (We know—you’re thinking those are a given. But not so fast.) While struggling with those might not seem possible at first glance, it makes more sense when you consider the simple fact you’re operating out of a different space and on a different timetable than a typical restaurant. A couple of other common struggles include maintaining inventory and employee scheduling. Fortunately for owners of a Clover POS, there are five specific apps to consider helping you mitigate all of these.
Food on a Truck
This should probably be considered step one for new food truckers. Why? Because this app helps address a lot of vertical-specific issues. It gives you the ability to send out automatic tweets to your customers to let them know where you’ll be, peruse a helpful sales dashboard, take advantage of easy website scheduling, get access to customers surveys, and more.
Shopventory
This app is a great resource for tracking food usage, placing orders, and assessing profitability of various dishes and combos. It’s also invaluable at helping with shrinkage, stocking, cash flow, profitability, mission control, employee management and more.
OrderEm
Want to reward regulars? If you value repeat business, then of course you do. Assuming you can handle capacity, OrderEm lets you offer online ordering from your website or Facebook, with all orders seamlessly synced to your Clover POS.
Social Branding
There’s no doubt social media plays a particularly important role for mobile food sellers. After all, that’s how many signal today’s location and menu to their fans. That’s why you should consider Social Branding by Zoomifi to promote all of your social channels on receipts. It lets you select up to four logos or icons that you’d like to print on the receipts along with your custom messages for each one.
Social Media Marketing
Let people know where you are and what you’re cooking with Social Media Marketing by BeSocial. This app also lets you automatically share your messages and promotions with your customers, discover your social media ranking and monitor your reputation online.
Clover Flex
Of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out the true hero that makes the 5 great apps above possible: the Clover Flex. This rugged, full-featured device takes a long-lasting charge, enabling food trucks to accept credit cards on the go without even needing a Wi-Fi signal. It’s a perfect complement to other Clover devices or an all-in-one POS solution perfect for food trucks’ specific needs, like seeing which locations yield higher sales overall and tracking geographic preferences for different products.
With a Clover POS and these five apps, you’ll ensure success is always on the menu for your mobile food truck business.

news_272,news,Mobile credit card processing: What you should know,"The way people pay for things has already changed a lot, and it just keeps changing. Read on for the latest in mobile credit card processing from Clover.…",30-11-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/mobile-credit-card-processing-know/,"The way people pay for things has already changed a lot, and it just keeps changing. These adjustments are partly driven by security concerns, and partly by consumers’ desire for more convenience and speed. For example, in the past couple of years, chip cards have become the norm in the U.S., according to a recent survey. These new cards are more secure, but that security comes at a price. Chip cards take a little longer to process, which frustrates customers; 87% of consumers say they’re frustrated at how long chip cards take to process.
Mobile credit card processing is one simple answer to customers’ frustration with long lines and slow transactions. A point-of-sale system that includes mobile card processors, like Clover’s, allows for strategic line-busting at busy moments. If you’re a coffee shop that always has a line out the door in the mornings, or a sandwich shop that’s always mobbed at lunchtime, you can have staff take orders and process payments on the floor, instead of making customers wait to get to the front counter. Clover’s extensive app market offers lots of programs that will make sure orders get sent back to the kitchen instantly, right from that mobile card processor.
A mobile POS device is also a great way to conveniently bring payments to your customer, allowing restaurants to take credit cards at the table, for example, or salons to take cards right at the chair. Not only does this save time, it can also help reassure customers that their information is secure, because their card never leaves their sight.
Mobile card processors also give you the flexibility to do business in new locations. Say you want to experiment with selling from a food truck, pop-up shop, farmer’s market, or festival. Mobile devices like the Clover Go and the Clover Flex enable you to sell on the go from a simple, hand-held device. You can accept payments even if you’re offline, and all the data you collect still goes right into your central POS system, so you know your inventory and customer information is always up to date.
A great mobile card processing solution should be easy to set up and use, and easy to integrate with the other systems that keep your business running smoothly. Gone are the days when you would need multiple technology solutions in order to take payments, organize your employee shift schedule, and keep track of your inventory. Modern POS systems, like Clover’s, can do all of these things, plus link seamlessly to your accounting software, and even help you analyze how your performance stacks up against your competition’s.
As consumer expectations change, your business needs to change with them. Your customers are busier than ever, and they’re used to the one-click convenience of shopping online. A great POS system that includes a mobile credit card processor can help you keep wait times low and meet your customers wherever they are—all while processing payments securely and making your business easier to run.

news_274,news,"Business problem turnaround: Customers browse your store, then buy on Amazon","Afraid of losing the sale to Amazon? Here are 7 tips to compete against online retailers, convert foot traffic into sales, and win over loyal customers.…",04-12-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-customers-browse-store-buy-amazon/,"“Showrooming”—the practice of viewing a product in-store only to purchase it from another retailer online, is a common concern for merchants, and with e-commerce sales expected to exceed $370 billion in 2017, it’s no wonder why. Yet more than half of shoppers still visit stores to inspect products before they buy according to Retail Dive’s recent research. This offers merchants a unique opportunity to win the sale, or better yet, to inspire customer loyalty and repeat business. Here are 7 tips to convert foot traffic into sales.
1. Appeal to your best customers.
There are some customers who will only buy from the cheapest retailer, regardless of what you do. Ignore them. Focus instead on your most profitable customers and uncover why they prefer to purchase from you. Is there a unique feature of your products or store that appeals to customers? Do your products attract a niche audience who prefer handmade items, or things that are customized to them? Are they looking for something truly unique, or locally sourced? Do they prefer to purchase from businesses they know support the same causes? Do they want a special touch such as a handwritten note, unique wrapping paper, or assistance putting together a complicated product? Many customers are willing to pay a premium for superior quality or service, and sometimes the small details tip the sale in your favor.
2. Boost your online, mobile presence.
If customers are comparison shopping in your store, make sure they find you in the search results! Pointy is an app that helps drive traffic to your store by creating web pages for all of your products and services, complete with images and names. Pointy also helps your store rank locally, which is crucially important. You not only want to make sure the person in your store is reminded to buy from you—you also want to attract shoppers nearby and let them know you carry products they are interested in. Using an app like Pointy takes all the work out of updating your website and helps you close the sale.
3. Don’t “sell,” consult.
Ask the customer’s name, who the item is for, and what problem they are hoping to solve. Are they looking for slacks that are slimming, or the latest trend? Do they want a treat to end a meal that isn’t too caloric? Uncover what the customer wants and suggest solutions to problems. Make sure to focus on the benefits of a particular product and how they help the customer solve their problem. Teach your sales staff to be active listeners—to repeat what they think the customer wants to make sure their recommendations make sense. “OK, so you’re looking for an outfit that can be worn to work or out for dinner. Something fun, but still professional enough you can wear it to a business event? Have you considered this blouse? You can dress it up or down with these matching accessories depending on the look you’re going for.”
4. Personalize the experience.
Customers are tempted to price-shop when the sale feels transactional. Train your sales staff to give more personalized customer service. Even small things, like remembering a loyal customer’s name, helps personalize the experience and encourages loyalty. Clothing stores can offer to measure customers to make sure they’re getting the best fit, coffee shops can “remember” a loyal customer’s order, or service-based businesses can offer a free consultation to make sure customers are choosing products and services that are right for them.
5. Educated customers are better customers.
Another way to avoid transactional sales is to make customers more savvy about the products themselves. Offer an event where customers get to meet your suppliers. Make sure they understand that other local businesses rely on yours to sell their products. Whether it’s a taste-test, test-drive, fashion show, makeover, or free evaluation, an event can really showcase what makes your products, and business, unique.
6. Establish roots.
Customers who consistently buy local do so because they want to support their town or city. Become a vital thread in the fabric of your local community. Donate to local fundraisers like children’s’ sports groups or 5K runs to gain visibility. Encourage your city newspaper to cover events at your store by inviting reviewers or spotlighting your commitment to the community. Post images, on your walls and on social media, of locals enjoying your products. Develop a memorable experience for the next local festival so your business becomes part of an annual tradition. If customers feel emotionally tied to your store they are more likely to buy from you, regardless of whether it’s “convenient” or the best bargain.
7. Attract “regulars.”
Pay attention to local phenomenon and see if you can leverage them. Are you near a bus stop? How about offering a commuter special? Next to a community hall? Perhaps you can entice people to come in after BINGO or other regular events. Next to a senior citizen center? Offer senior specials. By monitoring the ebb and flow of natural foot traffic you can develop strategies for encouraging repeat business.
Bonus tip: Reward loyal customers. With the Clover App Market, offering a rewards program is easy. We can help you keep track of points, coupons, and more. Keep in mind that some of the best rewards are not monetary. (Check out these Crowd pleasers: 8 smart, affordable ideas to deepen customer loyalty.)

news_275,news,3 jobs your restaurant point-of-sale should be able to get done,"New POS technology has obvious surface-level benefits but beyond that, there are many features a restaurant POS has that are the difference between paying for a service and paying for a value.…",06-12-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-jobs-restaurant-point-sale-able-get-done/,"This guest post is contributed by Upserve.
For restaurateurs, the term restaurant “point of sale” is a bit loaded. It’s a necessary piece of technology, for sure, but for many owners and operators it doesn’t feel like it’s much more than a system designed to accept payments. 
New POS technology has obvious surface-level benefits (managing voids, EMV compliance, check splitting, restaurant analytics, etc.) but beyond that, there are many features a restaurant POS has that are the difference between paying for a service and paying for a value. 
But with hundreds of restaurant technology options available, restaurant decor decisions to be made, and menu ideas to be vetted and approved, it’s no wonder many restaurateurs are not exposed to the full power of their POS software.  
Time for a performance check-in with your restaurant point of sale. Can it get these three jobs done?
1. Build a better menu
Turning restaurant menu ideas into reality takes a lot more than selecting some appetizers, meat and pasta dishes, and a cocktail list. 
Restaurant owners and their managers know that they need to be able to quickly determine inventory, understand which dishes are selling, which ones never move, and even which seasonal items and specials will resonate with guests. Plus, during a shift, your servers want to be able to fire the right items at the right time, modify things easily, and know when something has been 86’d. That’s a lot of information to process. 
Your restaurant point of sale can help you manage all of that with these features:

Real-time inventory monitoring: Automatically cancel items and alert servers, that’s FOH and BOH communication streamlined
Menu templates: Adding your menu to your POS shouldn’t feel like putting together a jigsaw puzzle
Menu customization and menu search means that you can revise your menu, build courses and automatically fire items with a quick tap

 
2. Enhance the guest experience
Do you want to split the check 4-ways? No problem. Do you want to split the bottle of wine between two people? Should be easy. Adding the tip to an EMV transaction, closing out a tab–whatever it is that your guests need, you should be able to do it with ease. Enhancing the guest experience is the business of your restaurant POS. And that’s just when the guest is inside of the restaurant. 
Your restaurant point of sale should be able to help you enhance the guest experience with these features:

New vs. repeat guest breakdown: Understanding if you should drive up the check average or bring in new guests is essential
Online ordering: Because 6 percent of the total orders made in restaurants are online orders
Tableside service: With a mobile POS taking orders is not just easy, but leaves less room for error
Item notes: Because communication from the front of the house to the kitchen should be easy, and a food allergy is important information for them to have 

 
3. Lower employee turnover
Put simply: managing turnover can be accommodated with data and restaurant analytics. Using your restaurant point of sale, you can easily reduce costs and maximize the return on resources – both inventory and personnel. 
Built-in features should make it easy to keep a close eye on labor and inventory costs, day-to-day, hour-to-hour and shift-to-shift. You’ll know exactly which servers are making the most money, moving the most product, and keeping things most efficient inside and outside of the dining room. Something as simple as optimizing a floor layout, or modifying which staff members handle certain table sizes, can go a long way toward fully covered, completely efficient services…and happy staff.
Plus, these features of your restaurant point-of-sale keep restaurant staff smiling:

Split checks, split items: Split it as many ways as the guests at the table wants, really
Shift notes, a logbook: Communication should be seamless 
Check and tab management: Your servers move at the speed of hospitality, which means searching for a check, searching by tab and splitting everything easily is a huge bonus
Tip adjust: Because adding tips to the check without the card, especially with EMV compliance, shouldn’t disrupt anyone’s flow

Bottom line: if your restaurant point-of-sale is not saving you time, making you money, and providing you with a reliable, easy-to-use experience, then it’s didn’t pass this performance review.

news_276,news,5 Questions to ask about holiday decorating & merchandising,"December is becoming more competitive as retailers no longer wait for Black Friday to kick off their holiday promotions!. If you’re looking for a little inspiration, these five questions can help you start to strategize for the holiday shopping season.…",07-12-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-holiday-decorating-merchandising/,"Doesn’t it seem like the holiday celebrations start earlier and earlier? This year, we started seeing holiday decorations popping up well before Halloween! The December shopping season is becoming more competitive as retailers and merchants no longer wait for Black Friday to kick off their holiday promotions. If you’re one of those businesses who got a jump on their holiday merchandising, kudos to you. If you’re looking for a little inspiration to get in the spirit of things, read on! These five questions can help you start to strategize for the holiday shopping season.
1. What’s going to make you stand out?
Whether you’re selling online or from a brick-and-mortar location, tis the season to stand out from the crowd. Consider your curb appeal: your window displays and sidewalk-chalk signs are a great way to boost foot traffic this season. Check out this post for some in-store signage inspiration, as well as this post on how to create an eye-catching, festive window display.
Another way to be memorable: create an immersive experience! Most retail store decorations appeal to the eyes and (maybe) ears, but what about the other senses? Engage your customers with the smells of pine or piping-hot cookies, free hot cider, cuddling puppies at the pet store, or just some free candy canes to get them in the mood.
2. What products do you want to highlight?
When crafting your window displays or considering what products to highlight on your website, think about your seasonal inventory carefully. This season is a marathon, not a sprint! Make sure any seasonal items will carry through December 31 so you aren’t forced to offer deep discounts to clear your shelves. Likewise, think through how you’re displaying your key products. Are you stashing stocking stuffers by the cash register? Are the products that “go together” displayed together? Never underestimate the power of suggestion, especially when so many people are making their lists…and forgetting to check them twice.
3. What extras will you offer?
As fun as the holidays are, they can also be a stressful time. In lieu of having a team of elves to help, you can fill in by offering a few extra services to make your customers’ lives easier. If you don’t offer giftwrap usually, that can be a great way to make someone’s day. Gift delivery is another option: if you have a retail store, let your customers order or reserve their gifts online for fast delivery or pickup.
4. How can you stay true to your brand?
Holiday marketing doesn’t necessarily mean making it look like Christmas exploded in your store. Bah humbug can be fun too! If it doesn’t come naturally for you to go all in on retail store decorations, that’s fine. Establish the right mood and don’t be afraid to differentiate yourself. Your customers might find it totally refreshing to admit that the holidays bring their own unique stresses. It might be right for some to pipe in Christmas music, but consider that every single store on your block might be doing the same! Your version of a “holiday atmosphere” might be to find ways to help shoppers feel calm, focused and stress-free.
5. How can you be inclusive?
It’s easy to forget to see the forest for the (Christmas) trees. December is one month out of the year, and being inclusive to all your customers lasts a lifetime. Think beyond Christmas! Plenty of people celebrate Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Festivus, or simply winter. Keep this in the back of your mind when considering how to craft your conception of “holiday shopping” and include everyone!

Given the limited cash flow and manpower available to a small business in its infancy, it’s important that owners are selective about the social media platforms in which they invest.
While each social media platform has different strengths, there are a few overarching guidelines one should consider before joining any social media network.
1. Focus on outlets where your audience congregates
Regardless of where might be popular at the moment, the most important deciding factor for choosing a social media platform is that it’s where your audience hangs out. Each social media platform has different general demographic tendencies, but it’s important to do some research into your audience to ensure that your particular audience is there before you invest in a platform.
2. Focus on what you enjoy
It’s important that you consider what kind of content you enjoy creating most, since you’ll likely be creating all of it in the beginning and you won’t excel at something you don’t enjoy.
3. Focus on what will scale
It’s also important to consider which type of content you can create with the least amount of investment, since if you’re planning on being successful with social, you’ll be creating a lot of content. Pick a type of content and a cadence that you think you’ll be able to maintain indefinitely, since social media is generally a longer-term play.
Snapchat
Snapchat is a video messaging app that creates videos and photos that are unable to be saved, creating a kind of “blink and you’ll miss it” engagement. For businesses looking to create deeper relationships with a generally younger audience, Snapchat is a great way to show behind-the-scenes footage, tease new products, or create buzz around events. However, Snapchat’s audience skews young, with nearly 40% in the 18-24 demographic and only 2% over 55, though that’s beginning to change, with more than half of its users signing up currently are 25+.
Live Video Streaming (Facebook, Instagram, Periscope)
Even though live video streaming is rolled into products like Facebook and Instagram, it’s unique enough a feature to be called out on its own. Originally Periscope, and now Facebook and Instagram, offer users the ability to stream video live to followers, allowing them to get a great look at whatever you’re doing right now. This can be used to great effect by businesses, from streaming events (performances, seminars, interviews, parties), to giving tutorials and how to’s, to sharing behind-the-scenes with followers.

YouTube
The original video juggernaut, with over a billion users watching a billion hours a video every single day, YouTube is an excellent opportunity for businesses to share their knowledge and personality with the world. In addition, being owned by Google has its benefits, with YouTube videos ranking great in search engine results pages, meaning videos with well-targeted titles and descriptions are a great way to be found by customers. Note, in order to look great, video can have a bit of a learning curve, so be sure you’re able to put your business’ best face forward when uploading to YouTube.

Instagram
For businesses that have an element that will look great in photos, like design shops, photographers, clothing stores, florists, etc., Instagram is a great way to build your brand. While it has great reach, with a community of 500 million, 59% of which check it every day and 35% multiple times per day, Instagram is less suited for driving conversions since it’s limited the ability to link from an individual post to a product page to paid placements. However, with a little practice, Instagram is relatively easy to do well, so if your product or service looks great, Instagram is a great place to showcase it.
Facebook
What can be said about Facebook that hasn’t been said before? Everyone is on Facebook, and though all the talking heads have been saying it’s dying among the young the fact is that nearly 80% of American adults use Facebook, including 88% of adults 18-29. For businesses, the name of the game is pay-to-play on Facebook since several years ago, in an effort to generate revenue, an algorithm change rolled organic reach of business pages to ~10% (or less), though many businesses are seeing success by creating Facebook groups which notify users of new posts by default. Just be careful not to abuse your group, as if you fail to provide value beyond advertising, your group won’t be successful.
Twitter
For businesses just starting up, Twitter can have a bit of a learning curve, as it requires constant maintenance. However, for building a network, especially among the B2B community, Twitter has a lot of advantages, with its most important being the ability to connect directly with peers and customers directly. Twitter’s become the go-to feedback loop for customers trying to reach businesses, so ensuring you’ve got a plan to respond to customer tweets is important. The key to Twitter, just like any other platform, is to provide value. Share 2/3rds other people’s content and 1/3rd your own to grow your network while avoiding the appearance of being just another spambot. Manage your stream using Hootsuite or Buffer to segment your followers and schedule your tweets for the week.

news_278,news,6 retail blogs worth reading,Staying up-to-date on the latest retail trends can really impact your bottom line. Stay ahead of the curve by following these retail blogs.…,08-12-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/6-retail-blogs-worth-reading/,"The following article was contributed by Carol Wood, People Operations Director at Homebase. 
Running a retail business comes with a unique set of challenges, and it can be helpful to hear best practices from like-minded business owners and thought leaders. There are countless retail blogs out there that bring together the latest and greatest ideas. Here at Homebase, we’ve put together a list of the six blogs worth reading for anyone running a retail operation. They range from national organizations that keep you up to date with industry trends to day to day management tips.
Let’s jump right into the retail blogs you need to be reading.
1. National Retail Federation
Want to stay current on holiday retail strategies, industry trends, marketing tips, and more? That’s exactly what NRF provides. This trade association is the largest in the world, catering to retailers in the US and 45 other countries. In addition to frequent blog posts that keep readers on the forefront of the industry, they also offer “holiday headquarters” for all major retail holidays with tips and projections to help retailers of all sizes make the most out of them. This retail blog is a great one to follow for retailers that want to grow and keep up with technology moving the needle of the industry.
2. Retail Customer Experience
Price is something that you hear about day in and day out. While the industry gets more and more competitive, price drops are sometimes inevitable to stay in the game. However, low prices and even lower margins don’t often lead to the results retailers are looking for. Working on your customer experience will produce more loyal shoppers than a specific pricing strategy in the long run. On the Retail Customer Experience blog, you can learn the customer experience strategies that are working wonders for large scale retailers. This retail blog offers tips on how to put trendy retail strategies to work, such as personalization and how associates approach sales.
3. The Balance
The Balance is a finance website that ranges from personal to business. Overall, the blog isn’t retail focused, but it has a large section for small businesses with strategies that are easy to apply to everyday management situations. In the small business section you’ll gain knowledge on wide ranging topics such as growth strategies, customer service tips, and business loans. The Balance is helpful for all stages of a retail business, including the idea phase driven by a need for funding to established businesses that want to put a solid Small Business Saturday sales strategy into place.
4. Small Business Trends
A little more technical than the other blogs on this list, Small Business Trends tends to focus more on the data and technology news within the retail sector. Small Business Trends also includes some growth snapshots, so you can see if your retail business tracks with larger trends nationwide.
5. RetailWire
RetailWire aggregates retail news from other publications alongside their own articles and discussions. While many articles tend to focus on large retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon, much of their advice is applicable regardless of the size of your business. You can also find some perspectives on how current legislation might impact your business—like a recent article on how changes to net neutrality might impact your online storefront.
6. Homebase
Here at Homebase, our blog offers tips on employee scheduling, time tracking, and team communication, to name a few. We aim to help local businesses with tips and tricks to manage their business and employees. From hiring to employee appreciation to overtime law compliance, our blog posts help retailers take their businesses to the next level.
These are just a few retail blogs that can help improve your shop with a daily dose of inspiration and strategy. What retail blogs do you recommend?
Once you find the retail blogs that pique your interest, put the tips you learn to work in your business. Homebase can help with employee scheduling, time tracking, and more for free.

When you’re in need of some extra cash, you can go to a bank, an online lender, your credit card, even a rich friend. But what’s the smartest option? The answer, of course, depends on your particular needs.
Here are 5 ways to make the decision about which type of credit is right for your business:

If your top priority is speed, the deciding factor will be the type of lender. Getting a loan from a bank tends to take a long time and involve a lot of paperwork. If you need cash this week, consider getting a term loan from an online lender with a simple online application—you should have the cash in a couple of days. A cash advance—through a program like Clover Capital—based on your credit card sales can also get cash into your account quickly.
If you’re focused on cost, a traditional bank loan is the way to go. Get a term loan, or, if you qualify, an SBA-guaranteed loan, from a bank that charges reasonable interest rates. Banks tend to offer the best rates around, in part because they do take longer to evaluate loans (and approve fewer of them). You could also consider applying for a line of credit from a bank—that way, you’ll only pay interest on the money you actually spend.
If your main need is flexibility, you’ll probably want to go with a line of credit or a business credit card. With a line of credit, you’ll apply to a bank in advance, and then the money is there for you to spend whenever you need it. A business credit card offers similar flexibility with a less-intensive application process.
If you want a loan that helps build your business for the future, you may want to consider equity financing. Selling shares of your business to investors is a great way to gain some experienced advisors. Making connections with angel investors or, eventually, venture capital firms can also help you start preparing for an eventual IPO, if that’s one of your goals. Alternatively, using a credit card can help build a credit score for your business that could help you get bigger loans later; and getting equipment financing is a great way to work towards owning crucial equipment without having to pay for it all up front.
If you need a manageable repayment plan, getting a cash advance is likely your best option. The amount you can borrow will be based on your average monthly credit card sales—and so will your repayment plan. If you’re a Clover customer, Clover Capital is an option. This program can advance you some cash based on your average credit card sales. Repayment is easy, and also based on sales, so you won’t get stuck with payments you can’t afford.

Whatever your priorities are for your business, there’s a type of financing that will work for you. Take the time to go through all your options and figure out what type of credit will fit your needs best.

news_281,news,Enterprise behavior: Getting to know your best customers,"People in business often quote the 80/20 rule: 80 percent of your revenue is generated by only 20 percent of your customers. To be truly successful, merchants must deliver products and services that VIPs like. But how do you get inside their heads and learn what those are?
…",12-12-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-getting-know-best-customers/,"People in business often quote the 80/20 rule: 80 percent of your revenue is generated by only 20 percent of your customers. To be truly successful, merchants must deliver products and services that this 20 percent—the VIPs—likes. But how do you get inside their brains to know what they’re truly responding to?
Knowing the names of your best customers—everyone appreciates a personalized greeting when they walk through the door—and handing them their favorite item without the need to place an order is great. But in today’s tech-driven world, that’s not enough. Stiff competition lurks just down the street or the next URL away. Small business owners must gain greater insight into their top customers and know how they contribute to their bottom line. Otherwise, they risk losing them to another retailer who better serves their wants and needs.
The power of big data knowledge
Not too many years ago, handwritten sales ledgers contained the names and notes about what was bought scribbled inside. Business owners could flip through these books and highlight the names that appeared frequently, as well as the products that had the highest sales—a time-consuming process that ultimately yielded very little helpful information. That’s pretty much where market intelligence ended. But with significantly less competition—and no internet retailers—this rudimentary level of knowledge sufficed.
Today’s merchants face a drastically different reality. A 21st century business has to deal with 21st century problems, including bad online reviews, obsolete products, and slowing foot traffic. While technology has allowed these challenges to come into existence, it is also making things much easier for business owners.
With the simple scan of a barcode, digitized lists of who bought what are created for shopkeepers. Helpful? Yes. What’s really empowering small business owners, however, isn’t visible on first glance. But technology can uncover it.
Clover’s analytics app Insights is your in-house data analyst. It takes your data, analyzes it, and reveals sales trends, enabling you to know more than ever about your best customers and their buying habits. The exposed information might even cause you to change your opinion of what “best” means.
Insights will ID the person who visits your eatery like clockwork, ordering a cappuccino five days a week, exactly at 8:15 a.m. each morning. That $3.75 sale might not seem that valuable, but as we noted in a previous blog post, a customer’s consistent, small daily transactions can amount to an impressive revenue stream—more than you likely realize. Because the data analysis reveals the level of her loyalty (extremely high!), you now realize that there’s opportunity for a successful upsell. If she picks up a $3 muffin twice a week, the amount she spends will increase by several hundred dollars annually.
Similarly, the app can organize sales data and hone in on regulars who make one-off purchases that have recurring potential. This information would have been difficult, if not impossible, for a merchant to uncover without Insights’ capabilities. At the very least, it would’ve taken hours to mine, whereas Insights does it in just seconds.
In contrast, Insights also highlights the moments a regular customer deviates from his usual behavior—whether he switches to a different item (which could signal that he feels that the original purchase is no longer worth it or is particularly excited about a new product offering) or cuts back on his visits, an indication that he might be defecting. This knowledge gives merchants the ability to proactively reach out, sending an exclusive discount offer or engaging in a one-on-one, fact-finding conversation the next time he pops in.
Next steps
Small business owners who internalize the data and do nothing with it are minimizing their sales potential. Sure, getting to know your best customers starts with smart data analysis. But to really know your top clients, data analysis must be used to inform clever marketing programs. And guess what, technology can assist with those, too.
Learn the good, the bad, and the ugly by surveying shoppers using the Customer Survey or Feedback apps. They provide real-time feedback on customer experience by printing codes on receipts to entice people to take quick surveys.
Loyalty programs are also an excellent way to recognize and reward VIPs. Clover Rewards gives merchants the ability to create a unique rewards program that alerts consumers to discounts and special offers via email, text, and the Perka app. Delighted customers receive birthday rewards and other unique, free offerings. Reward VIP and regulars by gifting them bonuses.
Other targeted marketing campaigns can further solidify the relationship with your top customers. Clover Promos uses coupons to entice regulars to come in even more frequently, or to return if they’ve been delinquent. You’ll be able to track redemptions in real-time, creating even more data that can provide further insight into marketing best practices—and those best customers.

If you’re new to entrepreneurship, your budget and lack of staff might mean that you consider leveraging the flexibility and affordability of social media to grow your business. (Maintaining a multi-page website can be challenging, but posting a photo to Instagram takes just seconds.)
But, if you’re an established businessperson or are a tech-savvy merchant, establishing a web presence should be considered a must. A study reported by the American Marketing Association found that more than half of consumers hit up a business’s website for product information and related content.
Still unconvinced whether you need to devote resources to your own digital portal? Read on.
Create the narrative
Here are the typical steps you’d take to implement retargeting ads using Facebook as an example. Facebook allows businesses to retarget to its more than 1.8 billion monthly users using pixel-based retargeting.
Control the conversation
Exclusively selling your wares on Amazon, Etsy, Pinterest, and Ebay can be a great way to expose your brand to a wide audience. The downside? Your competitors’ products surround your items. This is why selling on third-party sites shouldn’t be your primary digital strategy.
Instead, think of your online presence as a hub-and-spoke model. Your own website should be the main hub where all your products, services, and content lives. Post product updates, information about new locations, and articles about the latest trends on your business’s website. Other sites and social media platforms are the spokes (or secondary locations) where consumers can discover your brand. Post links from your website on your social media channels. When others engage with them (like, click through, share), your reach will grow organically.
Build trust and credibility
A website is an extension of your brand, and it can be used to deepen the relationship with and educate your customers. A professional-looking website adds to your legitimacy and authority. A 2016 study found that more than a third of consumers believe that a smart website gives a local business more credibility. Furthermore, customers view a business as reliable when it provides shoppers a safe, secure e-commerce platform.
Offer e-commerce
Giving customers the ability to purchase items and services online is one of the main reasons why merchants should have a website. (For restaurants, online reservation making capabilities is tops.) But business owners shouldn’t limit the items featured on their site to simply what they sell over the internet. A website is a great place to highlight in-store exclusives and items you might not be able to sell online, enticing shoppers to your brick-and-mortar location. Merchants can use the Clover Online Store to create a mobile-friendly, secure way to sell on the web.
Be customer friendly
The top five things that consumers cite as being most important on a local business’s website are: a list of products and services, hours of operation, a phone number, prices, and a physical address. You want consumers keying in your URL instead of visiting Yellow Pages or Google for this information, so post it in an intuitive, easy-to-find spot on your website. When looking for information, most shoppers consult a website first. If they find what they need, they’re less likely to make a phone inquiry—saving you time and manpower.
Reduce your costs
Strong SEO boosts where your business appears in a Google search. Design a smart-looking website that utilizes SEO best practices, and you’ll gain an edge when it comes to organic search results. Or use a free SEO auditor to determine what’s holding your current site back. Your cost per customer acquisition will be significantly lower than it would be when using targeted advertising alone.

You can with retargeting ads. Retargeting is marketing to customers who have visited your site and then clicked away. Because customers have already spent time on your site considering your business and your products, retargeting ads usually perform much better than regular marketing. Customers who are exposed to retargeting ads are 70% more likely to convert into a paying customer than customers who aren’t exposed to these ads.
How “Anonymous” Retargeting Works
Even if customers have not identified themselves, you can retarget ads using something called “pixel-based” retargeting. Visitors to your site get “cookied” with a small piece of JavaScript code often called a “pixel”. When they go to another site, that cookie triggers specific ads on specific retargeting platforms based on where that visitor has been.
Here are the typical steps you’d take to implement retargeting ads using Facebook as an example. Facebook allows businesses to retarget to its more than 1.8 billion monthly users using pixel-based retargeting.
Step 1: Create a pixel.
First you need to create the small bit of code (the “pixel”) to put on your site. In the Facebook ad manager you can create a pixel simply by clicking on a button. There is one pixel per Facebook account, but once you created it you can use it for multiple purposes such as tracking visitor behavior.
Step 2: Put the pixel on your website.
Simply copy and paste the pixel code between the <head> tags on each web page or paste it in the website template to install it across your website. If you want to use your pixel to also track events and do more targeted marketing (like if someone abandoned a purchase) you’ll need to install event code as well. Here is Facebook’s Pixel Implementation Guide for more details. At this point you’ve created and installed the tools to enable Remarketing. The next step is to identify who should receive the ad.
Step 3: Create a “custom” audience in Facebook.
In this step you are defining who should see the remarketing ad. Go to the Facebook Ads Manager, click on “tools” and then “audiences”. Select “custom audience” and then click on “website traffic” to target people who have visited your site. Name it and click on “create audience” to finish.
Step 4: Create the ad.
Now it’s time to develop an ad specifically for people who have visited your site. From the Ads Manager in facebook, you can manage your remarketing ads by clicking on the “Audiences” tab. Next to your newly created custom audience, click on “Create an Ad.” Follow the prompts to create your remarketing ad. (Check out these Facebook guides to improve your Facebook ads and 5 Questions to Ask Before Launching a Marketing Program.)
Retargeting Current Customers
You can also retarget customers by uploading a list of your current customers. Clover’s Insights and Promo apps help you automatically collect customer data and build up customer lists that you can use on remarketing platforms. Check out these free apps on Clover’s App Market.
While it may seem like retargeting is highly technical, once you get over the hurdle of implementing the code you can develop really targeted and effective marketing campaigns.

news_285,news,Team leadership: How to run a staff meeting,"For fast-paced small businesses, “staff meeting” means a quick huddle before opening or after the morning rush. Make every minute count. Learn to run hyper-productive meetings that build camaraderie, boost knowledge, and activate employees. 
…",19-12-2017,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/team-leadership-run-staff-meeting/,"For many people, “staff meeting” means another boring, pointless hour to kill.
But for small businesses, time constraints actually work in your favor. When you have to huddle before the store opens or regroup after the morning rush, meetings need to be brief and to the point. No one has the luxury to ramble on or zone out.
It takes planning and skill to run hyper-productive meetings, but the benefits outweigh the effort. Effective meetings can build camaraderie, boost employee knowledge, and get everyone working toward shared goals.
For fast-paced businesses, developing a cohesive, high-functioning team is essential. Here are several ideas for turning short meetings into powerful team-building tools.
Open the books
Small business owners shoulder a lot of responsibility, which often makes them guarded, stressed, and unwilling to release control. But employees need information—both good and bad news—to be truly invested.
Information helps them understand the larger goals, engage in solving problems, and forge trusting relationships among themselves and with their employers.
In fact, the link between transparency and employee trust has been statistically proven. When companies provide reliable information that employees need, people are much more likely to view their employers as having integrity, goodwill, and competence.
Open up team meetings by honestly reporting on the state of the business. Are sales stagnant or slipping? Has there been an uptick in customer complaints? What positive developments can you celebrate together?
Insights Unlocked, a popular free app designed for the Clover system, backs you up with data. Weekly reports visually summarize total sales and average ticket size per guest, peak sales hours, new and repeat customers, lost customers, and more. Sharing solid information helps everyone understand business trends and brainstorm ideas together.
Periodically explain the nuts and bolts of one key area. Over time, employees grasp the bigger picture of how the business runs, building their knowledge and troubleshooting skills.
Share ownership
No one can do it all. Business owners need as much assistance as they can get—and empowered employees can provide it.
But how do you get order-takers to step into bigger roles? By handing over responsibility to stronger members of the team. With training and encouragement, they learn to make their own decisions, whether it’s rethinking seating arrangements or coming up with new inventory management systems.
The Clover App Market is packed with tools to help. Ask employees to research solutions, make a recommendation, and implement the change. At your next meeting, step out of the spotlight and call on employees to share their projects and results, using their own voices and authority.
Giving others leadership roles instills a sense of ownership and a real stake in the business’s prosperity.
Set goals
For big-picture issues, no one can replace the boss. While employees appreciate clear instructions, unvarnished information, and the chance to gain new experience, small business owners need to set and clearly communicate the goals. Staff meetings are an easy way to get everyone on board.
What expectations do you have for individuals and areas of the business? What expectations do you have for yourself? Which changes need to happen, and how will they affect the team? How will results be measured?
Whether the business is growing, sales are lagging, or it’s time for another round of improvements, letting people know what’s coming next helps them prepare.
Celebrate together
Most of all, staff meetings are a wonderful opportunity to recognize a job well done, celebrate work anniversaries, announce birthdays, welcome new team members, and say goodbye to departing ones. Your genuine appreciation for the members of the team will pay off in dedication and an eagerness to step up when you need them.
Small businesses depend on knowledgeable, hardworking teams. Turn staff meetings into a simple, no-cost vehicle for developing the essential support you need.

There are special restrictions to this deduction, so make sure you go over them with your tax advisor. For example, the space you’re claiming as a home office must be used regularly for that reason and cannot be used for any other purpose.
Travel expenses: If you travel to a client or deliver orders, your travel expenses are deductible. Likewise, there are numerous deductions for business trips as long as the expenses are business-related and reasonable, so if you go to tradeshows or visit a supplier make sure you keep all receipts including flight costs, rental cars, hotel, and food.
Equipment: Purchase any new equipment this year? Not only is this expense usually deductible, you have choices on how to deduct it. For example, you can depreciate it over time to spread out the deduction over multiple years. Ask a professional to see whether it makes more sense to take the full deduction this year or depreciate it over time.
Employee compensation: Whether you have employees or contract workers, any compensation you pay—salaries, bonuses, or hourly fees—are deductible.
Benefits: Similarly, any benefits you pay for employees such as health insurance, group-term life insurance, sick pay, vacation time, and pension plans are deductible.
Employee perks: If you offer your workers perks beyond compensation and benefits, ask a tax professional if they are deductible. Employee discounts, free memberships, or tickets to events are examples of common employee perks that may be deductible.
Business expenses: Many common business expenses, such as license fees, legal and accounting advice, marketing and advertising expenses, professional development, or even interest on business loans are all potential deductions. Make sure to keep all receipts and details on what you received for these fees for your tax advisor.
Insurance: Several kinds of business insurance are currently deductible including professional liability insurance, accident and overhead insurance, coverage for casualty and theft, losses, and unpaid debts.
Charitable donations: Contributions to charitable organizations may be eligible for a deduction, but the rules are tricky. Make sure you keep detailed records, especially when donating your time. For example, if you donate your expertise to a charitable event your time may not be deductible, but you may be able to deduct the mileage or other costs.

Tax Strategies to Start 2018 Right
Set up a system early: In order to take deductions, you need to keep certain written records handy to prove you are eligible. Investing in a computer-based program to track your sales, expenses, and inventory helps keep all the details organized and ready for tax-time. Clover offers several options to help, but if you’ve already invested in a program such as QuickBooks syncing it to your POS system is easy. (Check out available apps in the Clover App Market.)
Train employees to save appropriate documentation: Ensure that all employees know what receipts to keep and what information you’ll need to process taxes at the end of the year and have a system for keeping them organized. For example, if you or your employees are using personal vehicles to deliver orders you’ll need to keep track of the mileage used solely for business.
Share your business goals with your tax advisor: When you schedule time to go over your 2017 tax deductions with a tax professional, set aside additional time to review your future goals. For example, if you’re considering purchasing a business vehicle or large machinery, there may be energy tax credits or special deductions you should consider when making purchase decisions. Or if you’re planning on staffing up, they may have advice on how to set up payroll and tax withholding correctly.

1. The perfect employee
via Giphy
Delegating a piece of your vision to someone else for the first time can be gut-wrenching. Your business is your baby! But finding that perfect someone to help take your company to the next level? Priceless.
2. A room full of regulars
via Giphy
Running a business has its ups and downs, but the people who keep coming back—no matter what—make it all worthwhile. If only all your customers could be so loyal.
3. A big tax return
via Giphy
That dance you do when a huge refund is coming your way…these reindeer know what’s up. How great would it be to get a surprise bonus check from the IRS come spring?
4. Selling out of all your inventory
via Giphy
There’s no better feeling than clearing out of all your inventory right on schedule. Cheers to you, you in-demand marketing genius!

New gadgets that function better than a snarl of Christmas lights would be nice.

As it turns out, 2017 was a great year for small businesses. Based on early projections, “nearly three-quarters of entrepreneurs are optimistic their 2017 year-end revenue will surpass 2016 revenue.” Cheers to you and here’s hoping 2018 is even better!
Kick back with friends, family, and a toasty mug of hot chocolate and enjoy the holiday season! We can’t wait to see what next year brings (hopefully, human cloning ).

But if you can’t take payments, or you can’t take the types of payments your customers prefer, nothing else will matter. Here are the top 5 things you need to know about taking payments:
1. Customers increasingly prefer credit cards.
80% of consumers say credit or debit cards are their preferred payment method and only 14% prefer cash. Credit cards are particularly favored for more expensive or discretionary purchases. But if you’re running a coffee shop or a fast food restaurant, keep in mind that a lot of your customers will still prefer to use cash.
2. Your business must be EMV compliant.
If you’re accepting credit cards, you’re now required to be EMV compliant, which means you must be able to accept chip cards. If you don’t have this required technology, you’re liable for all disputed transactions. Clover terminals, including the Clover Go that attaches to a smartphone for offsite transactions, are EMV compliant.
3. Mobile payments continue to grow.
Only 13% of consumers have used their mobile phone to pay for something at a retail store in the past year, but that’s up from 7% in 2015. And consumers are interested in making mobile payments–44% say they’ve either already linked a credit card to their phone, or they are likely to do so in the future
4. Security matters.
Consumers value security very highly. It’s top of mind when they’re choosing a credit card, and it’s one of the main reasons they prefer paying with credit cards in stores. Unfortunately, small businesses are increasingly at risk of cyber-attack, as they’re perceived by hackers to be easy targets.
5. Plan ahead for flexibility.
A traditional POS system with state-of-the-art security is a great start, but what happens when the line gets long, or you start selling product at festivals or in another location outside your store? A Clover Mobile can help you take and process orders while customers are waiting in line, to keep things moving faster, and a Clover Go will let you securely process payments anywhere you are.
There are tons of important decisions you have to make as a small business owner. But if you can’t take the types of payments your customers prefer, nothing else matters. These are the top 5 things you need to know about taking payments.

news_289,news,What small businesses should look for in a POS system.,Run your business smoothly with POS system software. Clover lists key features to look for across point of sale systems to increase business and revenue.…,28-12-2017,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/small-businesses-look-pos-system/,"Choosing the right point-of-sale system for your business is like hiring a new employee. Each POS system comes with its own resumé of advantages, tools, and features to help you run your business smoothly.
Unfortunately, choosing a POS isn’t as straightforward as reading resumes and interviewing your top candidate. Luckily, there are some key features to look for across POS systems. Here’s what to focus on in your search:
1. Task automation
The best POS systems do more than simply accept payments. Today’s configurations will help streamline your day-to-day operations, freeing up your time for big-picture tasks.
Traditional payment processing terminals are stand-alone equipment that process credit card, debit card, EMV chip, or contactless payments (like Apple Pay). POS systems, by contrast, combine traditional hardware with software to track transactions, manage inventory and employees, and harness data to provide insights about customer behavior. Look for a POS system, like Clover, that can automatically send and store digital receipts, build your customer list for loyalty and marketing, and track your sales from anywhere.
2. Centralized data storage
Depending on how your business is set up, POS systems that centralize your data storage can be a big advantage. The POS system is cloud-based, giving you the flexibility and space to grow your business in all directions. Are customers visiting you at multiple locations? Do you sell online and offline? Are you managing inventory at multiple locations? Look for a POS system that allows you to track sales, returns and restocking, all from one central system.
Most importantly: a centralized storage system ensures your data can be stored securely while you’re on the go. Look for a POS software that monitors sales, cash, inventory and employees, all in one clean report or centralized dashboard. The best POS systems will empower you to unlock new insights from each day and see how your business changes over time without risking your data security.
3. Customization capabilities
Every business is unique, and not every feature built into a POS will be right for your needs. Look for a POS that comes with powerful customization features, like app integrations and channel-specific customization.
Adding a new POS should be painless. That’s where app integrations play a huge role. The Clover App Market is your one-stop-shop for the tools you need to customize your POS system for your unique business needs. POS software with integration capabilities will allow your existing applications—like Quickbooks, your payroll software, and more—to speak directly to each other. For particularly tedious tasks like bookkeeping and payroll, your POS should be able to connect directly with your business set-up.
4. Mobile capabilities
Before you start feeling nostalgic for those vintage cash registers, consider this. Research suggests that people perceive wait time to be longer than it actually is. Go mobile to create a pleasurable payment experience and encourage repeat business! Food trucks, pay-at-the-table restaurants and similarly untethered vendors can take advantage of a flexible, mobile POS to process payments right at the point of sale, instead of making customers stand in line. Free your business to make a sale anywhere.
5. Future-proofing
Many merchants worry that they’ll make a big investment in a modern POS system only to see it go out-of-date two years later. One month it’s EMV chip cards, the next it’s Apple Pay and touchless payment.
The right POS software will forever allow customers to pay in a manner that’s most convenient to them. Find a POS you can trust to keep up with your customers and will give you support no matter where your business takes you. Perhaps a year from now, you’ll want to take your POS to the next level. Worst case scenario, you have a problem that’s preventing you from accepting transactions. You want free 24/7/365 telephone customer support. A help app is also beneficial, too.
No matter what POS system you choose, Clover is here to help. Learn more about our POS software to see if it’s right for you!

It can provide countless opportunities for merchants to develop better service, explore new opportunities, and foster relationships with customers far beyond their traditional local footprint.
But just like with anything in business, it takes a little creativity, an investment of time and effort, and a little know-how to make social media truly work for SMBs.
Below, we offer several tips to improve your small business’ social media planning, creation, and workflow.
1. Before you speak, listen — Because of the semi-anonymous nature of the internet, customers will speak quite candidly about what they love about your business, what their needs are, and what things you could improve on social media.
Use this increased level of candor to really listen to your customers. Respond to their questions, make sure they know their concerns are heard. Ask questions of your own to learn what it is they’re truly after from your business.
The insight provided can help you improve your business along a number of fronts, and provide you with guidance on how to execute on the other half of the social media equation.
2. Make your customers the focus of your content — Many a small business owner has made the mistake in thinking that social media is just a place to post free ads rather than another venue from which to serve your customers.
Use the insight gained about your customers from your active social media listening to create a sustainable content plan that focuses on presenting your customers with the answers to the questions they have.
While creating enough content to maintain an active and healthy conversation might seem like a lot of effort, an engaged community can be created around your social media accounts by following this ratio: post 80% other people’s content, and 20% your own.
Your customers will actually appreciate you pointing them to other smart viewpoints, and you can use the original content you create to occasionally slip in a mention or a link back to your business.
Remember, focus on their needs over your own when it comes to content—otherwise you’re just another ad for them to ignore.
3. Streamline your social workflow — While you should only maintain social media accounts where your customer base actually congregates (each site tends to have certain demographic tendencies), chances are you’ll still need to manage posts on several accounts.
This is where applications like Hootsuite and Buffer can help.
Hootsuite is a powerful, highly customizable social media dashboard that allows multiple users (teams) to monitor social analytics, post, schedule future posts, and even manage social advertising.
Buffer is a lighter, easy-to-use social media scheduling application that also provides performance metrics and makes scheduling many posts at a time simple.
Both have their strengths and weaknesses (complexity, cost, number of accounts and users, etc.), but one of the biggest advantages both share is the ability to do all of your social media posts in advance.
4. Maximize your social impressions by knowing when — The key to making the most of a scheduling app is knowing when to post.
Hootsuite will automatically suggest the best times of day to post, and Buffer provides an optimal scheduling tool that looks at a number of factors like past performance and similar profiles to suggest when is best.
But if you’re just doing a one-off or are choosing to schedule your posts manually, make sure to schedule according to the best times and days for that particular social media site. For details on many of the most popular sites, check out this infographic from Hubspot.
5. Automate your creativity — Creating professional-looking social media posts is a skill in itself, but there are a number of apps available that can help you automate the creation process, giving your photo and video posts the slick polish to really improve your image.
Ripl takes your photo(s) and text, and in a couple steps, allows you to choose great, professional looking layouts that combine cool fonts and animation to make your posts really stick out from the pack.
Magisto does a similar magic trick, but with video, advanced editing techniques, custom branding, and licensed music to make your video posts look like you hired a professional agency.
Both have free functionality, but if you’re looking to take your social videos and photos to the next level, the paid versions are worth every penny.

Here are five free […]…,02-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-free-tools-improve-online-presence/,"Marketing your business effectively doesn’t always have to cost money. You can get your business in front of new and existing customers simply by improving your online presence. Many customers will research a business online before ever stepping foot in the door. It pays to make your business more visible online.
Here are five free ways to improve your online presence:
1. Add Your Business to Google My Business.
According to eBiz, Google still represents 72.48% of online searches. Make sure your business is not only visible on Google, but that your business listing is complete and accurate.
Google sources their information from various sources, including verified business owners (like you), business websites, users who offer reviews, and third parties. If Google sees a social media profile that appears to be your business, it might take information from that source, or from sites that offer relevant services such as GrubHub and UrbanSpoon. If you don’t verify your business and complete the listing, your business might not include basic information such as a phone number, or worse, might have inaccurate or old information.
Here is Google’s official page to Google My Business.
2. Include your business on Apple Maps.
People with Apple devices are three times more likely to use Apple Maps Connect than other map services. Reaching this audience is as simple as adding your business to Apple Maps.
To get your business up on Apple Maps you’ll need an Apple ID. Start the process here. After logging in, identify yourself either as the business owner or authorized by the owner. Then confirm your location, business hours, website, and social media accounts. That’s it—you’ve just made your business more searchable on Apple devices!
3. Claim your business on Yelp.
Yelp is one of the most popular customer review sites for restaurants and services, with 142 million users every month. Claim your business and you’ll be able to add photos, link to your website, and make sure all your basic information like business hours and phone number, are complete and accurate.
Even better, claiming your business allows you to interact with customers and respond (privately or publicly) to reviews. Get started: claim your business on Yelp.
4. Optimize your website for search engines.
Some research indicates that when customers use Google to search for something, 90% of the time they click on organic search results, not on ads. Making your organic results both visible and persuasive is an important part of your marketing plan.
SEO doesn’t always mean getting super technical—there are many common-sense and simple tweaks you can make to your site to increase visibility.
5. Join a social media platform.
Social media is another great tool to spread the word-of-mouth about your company and increase your online presence. The most common social media platforms for business are Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, but that doesn’t mean they are the only options or even the right sites for your business.
Consider having a presence on places such as Pinterest or YouTube where you can post images or videos of your products and really highlight what makes your business unique. If your business caters to aficionados, for example, having high-quality images of unique items on Pinterest with a link back to your site can really increase traffic. Once you’ve done the basics, don’t forget to encourage reviews from happy customers and to respond to posts about your business. If you see negative reviews, respond promptly, but carefully. Once you’ve done the basics, don’t forget to encourage reviews from happy customers and to respond to posts about your business. If you see negative reviews, consider responding promptly but carefully.

news_292,news,5 small business resolutions to make 2018 great,"A new year calls for a fresh start, and in 2018 we’re all about embracing positivity! Check out our five small business resolutions to make 2018 great. Go into the year with confidence by updating your ecommerce site, embracing cybersecurity, or mastering your social media plan.
…",02-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-small-business-resolutions-make-2018-great/,"So many New Year’s resolutions seek to address perceived flaws. According to one poll, some of the most common commitments (which are regularly broken) include exercising more, losing weight, eating healthy, and drinking less alcohol. It’s no wonder these resolutions are broken: they focus on the negative—on individual insecurities—rather than starting the year on a positive note.
This year, think big, be bold, and get inspired! We see each new year as a chance to start fresh, get motivated, and bring greatness to your (already great) business. Try a few of these new years resolutions to start 2018 off on the right foot.
Protect your customers.
2017 was the year of hacker attacks, and small businesses were among the biggest targets. Unfortunately, cyber criminals targeted small businesses six out of 10 times. These attacks are largely successful, and result in 60% of merchants having to shut down their businesses within six months of a security attack.
The good news? There’s a way to protect yourself—and your customers. Clover Security Plus gives you end-to-end encryption and tokenization technology to protect your customer’s data. A built-in PCI compliance wizard helps you adhere to the latest security standards and gives you a security score to help you benchmark your data security and risk reduction. Another way to be more secure? Upgrade to Clover’s EMV reader. If a business doesn’t have an EMV-compliant POS, they are automatically liable for any fraudulent transactions when they accept payment from an EMV chip card. Make sure your hardware is equipped to take payment cards with the new security features and protect your customers.
Make your customers your #1 fans.
Of course, mom will always be your number one fan. But wouldn’t it be nice to have a small contingent of loyalists this year? Make 2018 the year of deepening customer relationships—and thus customer loyalty. Depending on your industry, increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase your profits by 25% to 95%. There are a few simple ways to turn first-timers into lifetime fans. Start a loyalty program to bring your most valuable customers in more frequently. Take advantage of the high-volume holiday foot traffic to start recruiting new brand evangelists. Use your social media channels to give your best customers a shout-out—and make it easy for them to do the same in return. If you’re looking for an easy way to put these ideas into action, try Clover Customer Engagement. This suite of free tools gives you data points to help you get to know your customers better, increase sales, and grow your business.
Up your HR game.
If we take nothing away from 2017, it should be the importance of strong HR practices. Even small businesses need to be accountable to treating their employees right, and luckily, there are some easy tools to keep your staff happy. Start by implementing proper HR policies since, as one survey found, “respectful treatment of all employees at all levels, compensation/pay, benefits and job security” has a direct impact on morale. HR doesn’t have to be an expensive endeavor: try an app like Gusto. Gusto is an easy way to automatically file taxes, and has expert customer support. It’s ideal for businesses with under 100 employees.
Spruce up your online store.
This year, having an online store stopped being optional and became mission critical. More people shop online than in-store, meaning you’re missing out on a huge revenue opportunity by staying exclusively in brick-and-mortar storefronts. An easy, achievable New Year’s resolution that can give you big bang for your buck is to give your ecommerce site a quick refresh. Don’t miss out on a great way to draw new customers into your store, sell beyond your immediate location, and provide a convenient service for your best customers. Try Clover Online for custom-design templates that make it easy to have a professional-looking presence for your virtual customers.
Become a marketing master.
Last, but certainly not least: make 2018 the year you master your marketing plan. Turbocharge your social media presence with these eight social media hacks. Entice your loyal customers to share your content with easy incentives—Social Branding, an app available in the Clover App Market, can help build up a social media following by promoting your channels right on your receipts. Already a pro at social media? Use Clover Online Listings to ensure your business is accurately represented in a network of over 70 maps, apps, search engines, social networks and directories.
Still looking for a little inspiration? Look no further than your most trustworthy staff and/or customers. These are the people who can give you the most on-point suggestions for improving your business. Resolutions work best when they come from a place of true introspection and desire to do things better. Honor their suggestions by thinking critically about how you can bring more success on every level of your business this year!

news_293,news,3 ways your restaurant POS can enhance staff communication,Every restaurant has a front-of-house (FOH) and a back-of-house (BOH) staff. And every restaurant experiences the typical struggles of the all-too-common anxiety that can arise when the FOH and BOH are not aligned.…,03-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/3-ways-restaurant-pos-can-enhance-staff-communication/,"This guest post is contributed by Upserve.
Every restaurant has a front-of-house (FOH) and a back-of-house (BOH) staff. And every restaurant experiences the typical struggles of the all-too-common anxiety that can arise when the FOH and BOH are not aligned.
Communication between front-of-house staff and back-of-house staff is essential to a successful night in the restaurant. While there’s rarely room for error during a busy shift, we all know that issues tend to arise anyway. And in the heat of the moment, tension between FOH and BOH are often the causes of those issues. But the bottom line is this: FOH and BOH unity determines the quality of service. Smart restaurant owners and managers know this, and make conscious efforts to unify both sides.

Tactics to unify FOH and BOH 
Understanding the differences between how the FOH and BOH function is step one. But there is more than meets the eye. A well-trained restaurant staff will understand the realities of their team members’ jobs, and will also make conscious efforts to work together and communicate well.
Here are three tactics to build into your restaurant staff training:
1. Avoid send backs

Have daily tastings of menu items and daily specials before the service so questions can be answered with first-hand knowledge.
Use a chalkboard or whiteboard to list ingredients the kitchen staff is using in specials. This prepares the staff for any questions about allergies later.

2. Train the FOH staff on how to handle dissatisfied guests 

Should the server notify a manager or go to the chef? Knowing who to communicate with is as important as knowing how to communicate.
Encourage your kitchen manager or executive chef to be present in kitchen, but on the same token, discourage servers from hanging out back there and slowing things down.

3. Implement training best practices on both ends

You have training for your servers and your kitchen staff. Make sure you implement some best practices that enable each side to see the other’s point-of-view in that training. One of the best ways to do this is to empower your staff to walk through key successes and breakdowns.

Staff training only goes so far, however. And it’s become all too common to see service and efficiency disrupted by communication problems. Restaurateurs need an everyday solution, and luckily, you don’t need another piece of restaurant technology: your restaurant point of sale system can enhance your staff communication and unite your FOH and BOH. 
3 ways your restaurant POS can enhance communication
It’s estimated that by 2023, the mobile POS market will be valued at $48.77 billion. This is great news for your staff communication for three reasons: faster service, less room for error, and happier guests.
1. Your restaurant POS can enhance staff communication with faster service.
Nowadays, restaurant POS systems come with built-in shift notes and logbooks that can accurately track the time needed to take, prepare, complete and deliver orders, plus it’ll track staff feedback on the entire process. No more asking “how long” five times.
2. Your restaurant POS can enhance staff communication with more efficiency.
A more efficient way to take orders means there’s less room for error. Your POS software should allow for inventory and menu specials to be updated in real time, so management can update menus, adjust specials and adapt to rush hours effortlessly. Your guests know exactly what’s available, and your kitchen isn’t angry when you’re putting in tickets for something that’s been 86’d.
3. Your restaurant POS can enhance communication with less room for error.
Say goodbye to messy, (sometimes inaccurate) handwritten orders. They only delay the understanding needed for food to be prepared accurately, and lead to “the blame game” when the guest sends their food back for being prepared incorrectly. An POS system with a built-in kitchen display system that sends orders right from the point-of-sale to the kitchen can make order management easier and kitchen efficiency simpler.

This post explores some best practices that can help equip your business with staff that are adept at interacting with and, ultimately, serving the customers. 
…",04-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-interviewing-customer-facing-staff/,"There’s one immutable truth every business must embrace: customers are lifeblood. As difficult as they can be to serve at times, their happiness and satisfaction are crucial to the long-term success of your business. That’s why it’s so important for you to equip your business with staff that are adept at interacting with and, ultimately, serving the customers. With that in mind, this post explores some best practices for HR searches when hiring a customer-facing position.
Since nearly every business has to face customers at some point (even online stores), this can really apply to any and all small business merchants. This could include sales staff at any retail outlet, but it could also include massage therapists, tutors, hair stylists, customer service agents, hosts/hostesses, or restaurant servers.
We’ve come up with 5 questions you need to ask as you try to identify potential customer-facing employees. If they’re able to answer these questions in the affirmative, it’s a good sign they possess these must-have attributes. It also ensures hiring them will let your sales force connect with customers in relevant ways as they conduct day-to-day business.
1. How easy is it for you to put yourself in a customer’s shoes and see a problem from multiple perspectives?
The key attribute you’re looking for here is empathy. The more flexible the employee is in understanding a customer’s needs, the easier it will be to help them find solutions. At the same time, customer-facing staff need skill in delivering bad news gracefully. Can your job candidate recount an anecdote (or role-play a theoretical) in which the news they had to share with a customer wasn’t ideal? How did they keep the interaction constructive and the customer as happy as possible?
2. How long is your fuse when dealing with a customer in a less-than-ideal situation?
Patience is crucial. You’re trying to determine if the employee is short-tempered and whether they are used to everything moving quickly and in an orderly manner. These are two very different things, but present challenges for the impatient employee. Customers may think in a non-linear fashion, may not articulate their needs, or may not know the products before coming into a particular store or place of service. A good customer-facing employee exercises patience while trying to help.
3. Have you been a client of our store in the past?
This question deals with having a complementary aesthetic. It goes without saying that it’s important to find customer-facing employees who are polite to customers. But following that train of thought, it’s even more crucial that your employees reflect the aesthetic and energy of your business. So, for example, if you run a yoga studio, having customer-facing employees who stay calm and cool reinforces your brand. And if you’re running a party or events company, high-energy employees instill confidence that the products will be fun and engaging. An ideal potential candidate would be someone who might have been a former customer. Their sincere appreciation for your product or services will be evident in their communications.
4. How good are you at identifying customer needs and solving their problems on your own?
This is all about initiative—a mandatory trait for providing top notch customer service. To be sure, the best customer-service employees can solve problems for customers in need with creative ideas that stay within the bounds of proper business practice. Instead of just following a script, ideal employees will stay within the bounds you’ve laid out for them, but provide customized service to help your customers have the experience they want.
5. How comfortable are you working as part of a larger team?
Every new employee needs to be able to function as a team player. Even though the primary function of the employee may be customer-facing, you need to verify that they can coexist and collaborate with your other employees. Make sure that they’ll support other members of the team, and adapt as practices/policies of a small business evolve.
These five questions should serve as a good gauge of who would best serve your company’s interests in customer-facing roles. But beyond that, we also wanted to give you insight into a valuable tool you have at your fingertips that can elevate your customer service game to another level.
Feedback is free with your Clover POS. It lets you monitor sentiment about customer service directly through the app. You can also use the feedback collected as a teaching tool to reinforce good behavior and discourage behavior that does not align with your brand. It’s a game changer for businesses because it enables you to get ahead of any negative feedback or reviews before they make their way to review sites like Yelp.
Armed with these questions and this app, you should be well equipped to get your staff, and your business, perfectly positioned to deliver the best possible customer experiences.

news_295,news,MVP: 5 ways Clover can make your work life easier,Start 2018 off right with one of these five apps that can shave hours off of your calendar.…,09-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/mvp-5-ways-clover-can-make-work-life-easier/,"Make 2018 your most efficient year yet by aggressively weeding out tedious and time-consuming tasks that could prevent you from cultivating your next big idea. The apps described below will handle your most labor intensive responsibilities accurately and efficiently. Consider bookmarking this post and the next time you take a coffee break, look into one of these time-saving apps. They only take a few minutes to set up, but you’ll be surprised at how many days—yes days—you’ll earn back.
1. Automate your accounting
Commerce Sync will eliminate the laborious task of manual data entry by automatically syncing the daily sales on your Clover POS with accounting software like Xero and Quickbooks. It only takes a few minutes to set up and once activated, sales can be transferred as quickly as the next business day. Customers save on average 300 hours per year with this powerful tool. Break that down into an average eight-hour working day and you’ve just uncovered 37 days worth of extra time!
2. Streamline your sales tax
Eliminate the time it takes to fill out paperwork and file your taxes by installing DAVO Sales Tax. This app automatically sets your sales tax aside each day and then files and pays your sales tax for you, accurately, in full and on time. Once installed on your Clover, DAVO Sales Tax will automatically start working the first day of the following month. Conservitavely, a business can spend five hours throughout a given month calculating sales tax. It may not feel like it at the time, but those hours add up to around seven and a half working days a year!
3. Master your digital marketing
Clover Online Listings helps you make sure your business information, like address, phone number and business hours is accurate throughout Google, Bing, and Yahoo! search results and on more than 70 other important sites so it’s easy for customers to find you. You can manage all listings and reviews from one, simple dashboard, so there’s no need to login to multiple sites. If it takes an average of five minutes to login, check and edit a listing then you can easily spend six hours of work each time you perform an online audit. Do this manually and you’re looking at about eight working days a year.
4. Simplify your scheduling
Building a schedule that ensures your customers are served efficiently, while accommodating employee preferences and requests for time off can be frustrating, as well as time consuming. For example, most business managers spend an average of four to five hours per week on scheduling and another four to five hours on per week on payroll. Installing an employee scheduler like Homebase reduced the average time it took to perform both of these tasks down to just a half hour. Total time saved: 65 working days a year!
5. Master your inventory management
Whether you’re running a restaurant or a retail business, making sure your inventory is fully stocked and ready for whatever your customers need is complicated to say the least. Implementing a real-time inventory management system like SimpleOrder for restaurants or Shopventory for retail will automate these tasks, plus you gain the ability to quickly identify low performing items that might be replaced with new offerings. The time it takes to attend to inventory varies depending on your business. For a restaurant, inventory may require 10 hours a week while a small boutique may only need half as much. If we estimate eight hours a week for inventory, the right inventory management system will save you 52 working days a year.
Want to do some fun math? If you implement all five of these apps, you could be saving upwards of 169 working days a year, that’s 1,352 hours! Think of all the innovation you can bring to your business with that kind of extra time.

news_296,news,Enterprise behavior: How to launch a new product or service,"Before investing too much money in launching a new product, it pays to do a soft launch and get feedback. Here are 5 steps for launching your new product or service.…",10-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-launch-new-product-service/,"Before investing too much money in launching a new product, it pays to do a soft launch and get feedback. If you’ve done your due diligence, you already have a good sense of what the product is, why customers will want it, who your target audience is, and how much you’ll have to sell to make it a profitable addition to your product mix. Now it’s time to launch your idea in phases so you can evaluate and re-calibrate your strategy as you learn from the launch. Here are 5 steps for launching your new product or service in stages.
1. Give it a test drive.
Review your town’s local events to see if there is a natural tie in to your new product or service. For example, if there is a 5K, sign your team up to run in your latest sneakers—all in the same color—with pins that say “Ask Me About My Killer Sneaks.” If you’re a dance studio, get your students to demonstrate the latest dance moves as the entertainment at your next town festival and have the crowd vote on what kind of dancing they’d love to learn by texting your business or voting on your social media page. Is there a local charity event supporting a 50-year anniversary? Offer a free trial of your product or service to every 50th person who visits your store that day. Use Clover apps like Opinion Shoppers or Customer Survey to gather valuable feedback from customers along the way.
2. Challenge your customers.
If you have enough product for a larger test and have already incorporated the initial feedback, it’s time to generate word-of-mouth and reviews at the same time. Bring out the competitive side of your customers by issuing a challenge. Ask customers to come up with the best name or do a blind taste test against their favorite brand. If you’re selling clothes, challenge them to come up with the most unique outfit. Have them post entries on your social media feed and you’ll get in front of current customers…and their entire network. Then ask followers to vote. Don’t forget to offer a prize to the winner—this will encourage them to ask their entire following to vote for them.
3. Expand the test—invite specific communities to a preview.
If your product is appealing to families, offer the local Parent-Teacher Associations in your school district a free preview to the class who raises the most money for the school. PTA’s often rely on fundraisers, so giving them a prize giveaway will entice them to publicize your product to the entire school body and their parents. Bill it as a potential learning event where you teach kids how your come up with new product ideas and invite them to be part of the process. Kids and families will have more buy in for products they helped co-create. This idea of inviting your target marketing to be part of co-creation can be modified for any target market.
4. Evaluate the results.
After every test launch, use Clover Insights to help you answer these questions:

Did the product perform as well as expected? Why or why not?
Can I fix problems raised in any negative feedback?
Can I use any positive feedback to sell or promote the product?
Were my assumptions about who is the best target market correct?
What can we do better?
Are there ways to simplify the production process to make it easier or cheaper to produce?
Is the price range appropriate, or does it need adjustment?
Can I make a profit with this product?
Did the product help me meet my business goals?

5. Create a promotion plan.
Now that you’ve done a few rounds of testing and evaluated your results, it’s time to consider how to best promote your product.

Who is most likely to care about my new product? Come up with as many details as you can about your target market. Who are they? Where do they live? Why would they buy from you?
What is the best way to reach this market? For the next six months, what will your target market care about? Are there major holidays coming up, or perhaps a conference or other event? Where will they be and what will they be thinking about? Map out ideas of how your new product fits into their schedule and how you’ll be able to get their attention.
What is the most compelling reason they would want my new product? Come up with a brief value proposition: a very brief description of why they should care about it.
How can I promote it using the customers I already have?
How much money will I need to promote it? Ideally you already have a solid customer base to kick off new products, but if you can afford additional marketing a new product is a wonderful way to bring in new foot traffic.

The answers to these questions will help you come up with a promotion plan and turn your new product into a moneymaker. Need more help marketing your business? Check out the amazing resources native to your Clover device with Clover Customer Engagement.

news_297,news,Crowd pleasers: Aligning your business with a cause,The new year is a great time to align your business with a cause you and your customers share. Here are 5 ways to get involved.…,11-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-aligning-business-cause/,"The new year is a great time to align your business with a cause you and your customers share. Increasingly, customers “shop local” to support a business in their community, and they’ll redirect some spending from big-box stores or Amazon if they know their dollars are supporting a larger cause that matters.
How to choose the right cause for your business
When first starting out, come up with a list of potential charities or causes you might be interested in supporting. Take a look at larger organizations in your industry to see who they support. Then talk to your staff and customers to see what causes resonate with them. Consider surveying your customers to find out what they care about most. This will help you uncover organizations you might not be familiar with. Once you have a list, vet potential causes against these guidelines to see which ones rise to the top.

Be authentic. Choose a cause that has meaning to you and that you can commit to. Being part of something bigger—something that positively influences the world—can be a huge morale boost in your business, but only if you authentically care about the cause. So start with what moves you.
Stay relevant to your customers. Ideally your cause not only motivates you and your staff, but inspires and moves your customers to want to associate with you and your business. Businesses demonstrating social responsibility often can attract loyal customers who want to make ethical purchasing decisions.
Reinforce your brand. See if you can find natural synergies between the charity and your brand. Spas can help provide victims of abuse or cancer survivors with makeovers. Businesses that cater to pets should consider supporting local animal shelters. Is your bar or restaurant the local hangout for the firehouse across the street? Help fundraise for their safety equipment. There are so many ways to make a difference…try to find one that fits into the greater story of your business.
Keep local. Whenever possible try to choose charities and causes that are nearby. This helps employees and customers see where the money is going, helps them feel that they are making a real difference and reinforces the message that you are an integral part of the community fabric. “Buy local” has much more meaning when the local business supports the rest of the community.

How to show your support: 5 quick ideas to get involved
Once you have chosen a cause, think through how you can make a difference and how involved you want to be. Here are a few quick ideas:

Volunteer your time or services. Get a team of employees together, with branded shirts, to volunteer at the next charity event. It’s a great way to make your contributions more visible to the community.
Donate products or materials. This is a natural for restaurants or other businesses with inventory that dates quickly: Send leftovers to food pantries.
Give money. Donating cash is a quick and easy way to get involved, but may not be the most satisfactory.
Raise money for the cause. There are several apps that now make this extremely easy. CoinOut, for example, allows customers to round up the amount of their purchases, then donate that extra change to a good cause. Donate at Checkout is another option. Merchants can pre-program a list of charities and suggested amounts to encourage larger donations, or use the round-up feature. You could even attend an event and use a Clover mini as a donation box using Donate Here.
Educate customers. Sometimes supporting a cause is as easy as spreading the news and encouraging customers to get involved. For example, cancer awareness campaigns can teach customers about the symptoms and signs to watch for.

However you choose to support your cause, make sure you are transparent about how your business is involved.
How to measure your efforts (and inspire more giving)
Not everything requires measurement, but keeping track can help inspire more donations, and may even help the business get a tax deduction. If you set a goal—such as money donated, names on a petition, animals saved, or customers reached—you’ll notice staff and customers getting excited once they get close to reaching it. Even if you’re not providing regular updates on amounts, giving customers context for the ask can inspire more generous donations. “A one-dollar donation provides 3 meals to a hungry child” turns a single dollar into a powerful tool of change. Make sure whatever you report is completely accurate and amounts donated are transparent.
While giving to a charity is a valuable pursuit in and of itself, anything that takes a considerable amount of time should also be measured in terms of how it may be affecting your business. Consider using the Clover Customers app to measure:

How many of VIP customers participate in your cause-support program?
Is participation growing or declining over time?
Have your efforts increased foot traffic to your store? If you’re a restaurant supporting a local group, does the group regularly frequent the restaurant? Foot traffic is a measure both of potential revenue and your brand value. Clover Insights can show you easy-to-understand graphs of your foot traffic before, during and after events to help you determine results.

Keep the momentum going
Once you know who supports the charity (by tracking responses in the Customers and Insights apps), try a promotion offering a discount to people who visibly support your charity (for example, with a ribbon or T-shirt) on specific days. You’ll make your best customers feel like part of your team to make a difference.

news_299,news,How to establish an effective chain of communication between the front- and back-of-house [on-demand webinar],"Watch a complimentary webinar to learn tactics for improving communications between your restaurant's front- and back-of-house through education, coaching, processes and technology.…",16-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-to-establish-an-effective-chain-of-communication-between-the-front-and-back-of-house/,"Establishing an effective chain of communication between a restaurant’s front- and back-of-house is essential to ensuring smooth operations and an optimal experience for restaurant patrons.
Learn specific tactics for boosting communications between your kitchen and customer-facing staff with the below webinar, “How to Establish an Effective Chain of Communication Between the Front- and Back-of-House.“
Communication breakdowns can have a significant negative impact on customer experiences, especially since the front- and back-of-house have very different insights into what’s occurring on the restaurant floor.
Remember, the kitchen only sees ticket orders and food. Your front-of-house staff is customer-facing and bears the primary responsibility for ensuring a top-notch guest experience. The information they collect and expectations they set can make or break a patron’s restaurant experience.
Just how high are the stakes? Here are a few takeaways from the full webinar:
1. The order process can be rife with potential points of failure
To a patron, the process by which they order their food and have it delivered to their table might seem straightforward and linear. In reality, this process can be quite complex, with front-of-house staff and the kitchen having to be tightly coordinated in terms of orders, modifications, courses, guests and other considerations.
Multiply this by multiple tables per server, and you begin to see why clear communications and tight alignment between front- and back-of-house are so essential to a positive customer experience–and for a smoothly running and profitable restaurant.
2. Incorrect communication can be costly for restaurants
Communication breakdowns can result in losses on every meal that can begin to add up if they occur shift after shift, night after night. Remember: most restaurants run on thin margins anyway, so effective FOH and BOH communication is a key way to protect restaurant revenue. Opportunities to get this right–or fail at it– present themselves with every new party you seat.
Every incorrect order entry, and every meal sent back or comped due to unmet expectations, eats into a restaurant’s profits.
That’s not to mention the harder-to-calculate cost of dissatisfied customers. The loss of repeat business, and the reputational risk of bad word-of-mouth and online reviews, can pose a significant threat to your future revenue potential.
3. Technology can go a long way towards streamlining communication
Technology can be a great ally for solving problems and streamlining processes, but make sure the tech is adapted to your business. While a great point-of-sale technology can help you and your staff complete tasks more quickly, share information and make certain processes more error-proof, you’ll need to contemplate how your operation currently runs and be mindful of the objectives for any automation you apply.
Watch the webinar to learn tactics for improving communications between the front- and back-of-house through education, coaching, processes and technology.

news_300,news,Business trends & research roundup: Pay & compensation,How to compensate employees is a crucial question for a small business that doesn’t have a lot of extra cash to throw around. Taking a little time to think more strategically about compensation could pay off big in the long run. …,18-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-trends-research-roundup-pay-compensation/,"How to compensate employees is a crucial question for any business, but it’s even more critical for a small business that doesn’t have a lot of extra cash to throw around. As a small business owner, just keeping up with changing regulations on the minimum wage and overtime rules may seem like enough to worry about, but taking a little time to think more strategically about compensation could pay off big in the long run.
Understand your competition
Pay is just one part of compensation. Most small businesses also offer paid time off to their employees: 73% offer paid time off to full-time workers, and 67% offer two or more weeks. However, most small businesses (86%) handle time-off requests for new parents or people caring for sick family members on a case-by-case basis, so having a formal policy for family and medical leave could help you compete for talent. NFIB research
Small employers are also looking out for their workers’ work-life balance: 71% of small businesses allow full-time employees to work a flexible schedule. Work flexibility is now the benefit workers prefer most, so this is a great way to retain your best employees. NFIB research, Fortune
One way to stand out from the pack might be to offer a 401(k) or another retirement savings plan. Only 38% of small businesses are helping their staffs save for the future. NFIB research
Use pay to motivate your staff
You know that money is a great motivator. But did you know that people are more productive when pay is transparent? Creating a transparent pay policy that your whole staff can see and understand will boost their productivity. The University of California at Berkeley
Commissions, bonuses, profit-sharing, and other incentive plans can also be great motivators that align your employees’ interests with yours. It’s best to keep incentive plans as simple as possible, and to avoid putting caps on how much people can earn. Use the Commissions app to design and track a simple incentive-pay system for your staff. The Reporting app can also help you track revenue and expenses to make sure your incentive pay is working to help you hit your goals. Harvard Business Review
High-achievers are easier to motivate. They can hit aggressive goals while working towards an annual bonus. But your lower-performing workers will need to get rewards more often to stay on track. Bonuses should be distributed quarterly to keep motivation high for the lower-performing members of your team. Harvard Business Review
Money isn’t everything
Turnover is a big problem for a lot of small businesses, but money isn’t the only way to encourage your employees to stick with you. At fast-casual restaurants, 98% of employees who get education benefits like tuition assistance will stay put, compared to 73% of employees who don’t get this benefit. US Chamber of Commerce Foundation
Rewarding your best employees with promotions and showing them there’s room to advance is another great way to retain talent. Workers who stay in one job without a title change longer are more likely to leave their current employer. Harvard Business Review
The majority of workers say benefits and perks are crucial in their decision to accept a new job. Health insurance, paid time off, performance bonuses, and retirement savings are the most important benefits to employees, but non-monetary perks also play a big role in keeping workers happy. Consider negotiating a discount at a local gym, giving employees a voice in your business’s charitable contributions, or simply bringing in free food. You may not be able to afford an on-site chef, but Bagel Friday can still do a lot to boost morale. Glassdoor, Fast Company

While working harder is not an option, you can work smarter.
The problem is, “smarter” means tossing out old systems and software for something better. Who has time to figure it all out?
With Clover apps, upgrading is so easy you’ll wonder how you functioned without them. Here are 11 of the most popular apps for simplifying tasks and shaving hours off your workweek. 
Manage people, and let Clover apps manage the paperwork. 
Hands-down, Time Clock by Homebase wins for most downloads. And for good reason: this free app reduces the hassle of managing people.
Time Clock handles critical tasks such as clocking employees in and out, tracking cash and credit card tips, generating payroll-ready timesheets, scheduling staff, managing time-off requests and shift trades—even sending people reminders an hour before their shift begins.
Eliminating busywork lets you focus on the big picture: stellar service and happy customers.
Use data to make sound decisions, fast.
You’ve heard about dashboards and analytics. But did you know that with the right app they’re remarkably easy to set up and use?
Insights is a favorite with small business owners. Functional and free, the app puts visual updates about how you’re doing and how you compare to competitors on your computer, smartphone, or Clover.
Charts and graphs pinpoint top-selling products and revenue-generators, ticket sizes, number of new and returning customers, and sales over time. The app even lets you peek at competitors’ data, with neighborhood stats that show where people are spending and how your own sales stack up.
Want to dig deeper into your financial health? Stock Reporting gives you visual snapshots of key store or product data—quantity sold, revenue, cost, and profit—and tracks adjustments such as breakage or loss. For rich customer data, Insights Unlocked can deliver surprising answers.
Intuition is great, but only data gives you the hard facts you need to identify trends and opportunities, and run your business as effectively as possible.
Attract customers the easy way: branded gift cards.
Custom gift cards aren’t just for giants like Starbucks and Apple. Any small business can create a plastic or digital card—and quickly increase their sales and customers.
Consider these figures: according to a First Data report, 25% of gift card users made an unplanned purchase, 8% bought a more expensive version of what they planned to get, and 3% purchased from a store they don’t normally frequent.
The Clover Gift Cards app is a popular solution for producing and managing your own branded card. The company creates a card with your logo, while the app lets you add money to cards, redeem them, track usage on-screen, and more.
Put paper ordering on autopilot.
Has this preventable headache ever happened to you? The supply stores are long closed, but you’ve run out of receipt paper!
In just three swift clicks, Order Paper lets you purchase inexpensive paper rolls for any of your Clovers, shipped free to your business. For convenience, this simple app delivers big.
Tackle the reservation chaos once and for all.
Managing crowds is easier when you have an app that does it all—make reservations, see who’s waiting, estimate how long the wait will be, send texts to customers when it’s their turn, even let people check their waitlist status online. Waitlist Me manages the madness, so you can relax. 
Get instant updates of customer reviews.
Negative buzz on social media is a killer—literally. Thrive helps you stay on top of Yelp reviews, Facebook and Instagram likes, MailChimp campaigns, and more. The app gathers real-time information into a single area on your screen. Knowledge is power!
Use pre-written job descriptions.
Laboring on job descriptions, application forms, or performance reviews is the last thing small business owners want to do. HR Resources does the heavy lifting for them. With airtight descriptions of common jobs, and the latest HR forms and manuals, this popular app makes hiring and managing simple and safe.
Make it easy for customers to reach you.
Use customer receipts to gather information about what people love (or not) about your business. Feedback prints a link to your private feedback form. The responses funnel into your Clover, giving you a quick rundown of what’s working and what needs fixing.

news_302,news,New & notable in the Clover App Market: January 2018,"It’s a brand new year, and time to try out better ways to handle time-consuming tasks. From streamlining payroll and taxes to creating your own app and membership program, three top-ranked Clover apps make it easy. Try them out for free.
…",22-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-clover-app-market-january-2018/,"It’s a brand new year, and a great time to re-evaluate the business and search for ways to make things easier.
From payroll to ordering to loyalty programs, are you handling the administrative side of things as efficiently as possible? Are you ready to let go of clunky processes and adopt new tools to simplify tasks?
Your Clover POS system comes with a growing collection of apps that take care of time-consuming functions. Scroll through the Clover App Market to find popular free apps and apps for purchase that will save you hours each week.
Simply download the ones that look appealing—or open pre-installed apps from the Clover dashboard—and discover how quick and easy it is to streamline, automate, and improve your business.
Here are three recent additions and updates to the Clover App Market that small business owners love. Make 2018 a year with fewer hassles and more time to focus on products and customers.
Gusto
For most merchants, payroll saps too much precious time and exposes them to costly errors—particularly at tax time. That’s why nearly half of small businesses outsource the function.
While outsourcing can help the business run smoothly, it often results in hidden costs, such as bundled services that payroll companies quietly add to your package. What if you could get the ease and expertise of an outside firm with the cost savings of handling payroll in-house?
Gusto makes it possible. This growing software company has teamed with Clover to offer a powerful app for your POS. Designed especially for small businesses, the web-based platform handles unlimited payrolls, federal and local taxes in all 50 states, W-2s and 1099s, direct deposit, health benefits, workers’ comp, and more.
Feedback from Gusto’s more than 50,000 customers show that 9 out of 10 say Gusto is easier than other payroll solutions—and quicker, too. The average time spent running payroll with Gusto? Just 7 minutes. In addition, 4 out of 5 merchants report fewer errors after switching to Gusto.
Try out this online system with a 3-month free trial for Clover merchants. If you’re happy with the results, Gusto offers a low monthly rate, as well as tiered plans that let you add extra services, such as 401(k) plans, FSAs, and HR compliance. Each plan comes with a support team available via chat, email, or phone—quick, professional advice for solving any problem.
Loyalzoo
Enduring brands know that customers buy more than just products or services. They buy identity and community—particularly millennials, who crave engagement, authenticity, and even friendship with their brands.
That’s great for small businesses, which often have an edge over big corporations when it comes to attracting younger buyers. Loyalzoo helps keep them engaged and coming back for more.
This popular Clover app lets merchants create their very own VIP membership program. Simply set up a recurring weekly or monthly charge, and members receive discounts on meals, unlimited cups of coffee, color treatments with their haircuts, upgrades on e-liquids, or any other premium service of your design.
Giants like Amazon Prime aren’t the only membership games in town. With Loyalzoo, you actively forge relationships with your best customers, while rewarding them with services and products they enjoy—and ensuring a revenue stream you can rely on. Try it for free.
Apptizer
Membership programs aren’t the only customized tools you can create. With Apptizer, you can even put together your own branded app for iOS and Android.
Even tech-challenged people find it easy to design a sleek-looking app that matches their business branding. The order-ahead app links directly to your Clover POS system to make transactions quick and seamless.
Here’s how it works: Similar to popular apps from Starbucks and other large companies, customers open your app on their mobile devices and conveniently place their orders. The app automatically generates a QR code for each order.
Orders are immediately noted on your Clover device, where you confirm the order and fill it for pickup. When customers arrive at your location, they simply scan their codes into the Clover POS and pay. Alternatively, the app’s built-in online shopping cart lets customers pay from their own devices.
While coffee shops and restaurants are naturals for a customized app, other businesses can benefit as well. Flower shops might offer a selection of arrangements that customers can order online for quick pickup. Bakeries could get a head start on boxing up big orders.
Anywhere where speed and convenience are needed, Apptizer can help. Plus, it comes with a bonus feature: Once people have downloaded the custom app, merchants can send them promotions and offers via push notifications from the Clover POS dashboard.
Learn how easy it is to build your own app with a 30-day free trial.
Start the new year right by letting Clover’s business apps simplify and improve your daily routines.

news_303,news,Business accelerators: Expanding into a new market or service,"Want to accelerate growth in 2018? Try a offering a new product. The key to successful product launches is ensuring your decisions are based on solid data. Here are 9 tips for making sure your product launch is successful.
…",23-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-expanding-into-a-new-market-or-service/,"Expanding into a new product or service can be a wonderful way to accelerate your business’ growth. The key to successful product launches is ensuring your decisions are based on a solid foundational program of data, insights, and test markets. Here are 9 tips for making sure your product launch is successful.
Strategy & Planning
Creating and launching new products or services can take a lot of time and money. Make sure this new product fits into your overall strategy for growing the business. Ask yourself the following questions before launching a campaign for a new product:

What business goal do you hope to achieve?

Are you launching the product strictly to bring in more revenue, or are your trying to create something that makes you stand out from the competition? Is this something your high-rollers have been asking for, or are you trying to draw in a new demographic to your business? Defining your goal will help you determine details of product design and launch and will give you a foundation for measuring its success when the campaign is over.

How will you measure the results of this campaign?

Establish some key objectives such as revenue targets, number of new leads who fall into the new demographic, or number of VIP customers who returned to take advantage of the new product.

What’s your break-even point?

Reaching the break-even point should be one of your performance objectives when determining whether the campaign is successful. The break-even point is how much you need to sell to make back your investment in the new product. To calculate this, add up all the development, production and launch costs, then divide that by the profit you make on each sale.
Before jumping into a launch, consider launching the new product in stages to fine-tune the product before releasing. (Check out Enterprise behavior: How to launch a new product or service.)
3 Effective Launch Ideas
Now that you’re clear on strategy and your goals, it’s time to consider the launch. Here are three ideas to market your new product or service.

Spread the love.

In a world where customers are bombarded with electronic alerts and messages, it pays to stand out with a beautiful card and a simple message. If you’d like to reward someone, give them something special—like your new product. Make a small, but beautiful business card that looks like a gift card and hand it out to existing customers to share with people they love. Have your cashier say something like: “Know someone who made your day? Give them a free powder manicure on us.”

Reward good customers with a “freebie”add-on.

Whether your new offering is a new service, a new product or simply free delivery a “freebie add-on” is a great way to get your best customers to give it a try. Identify buying patterns of your current customers and determine who are most likely to purchase your new offering. If you’re selling new sneakers, perhaps identify people who have purchased shoes from you before using Clover Insights. If that group is too large, narrow it down by those people whose shoes are most likely to need replacing. Then send them an email, text message, or other alert letting them know that they get a free manicure with their next haircut, or a free brake inspection with their next oil change.

Call the press.

Consider whether your product could be newsworthy and get local attention. For example, if you are a local pet shop and you donate your time to an animal shelter, ask the local paper or shelter if they would do a story on rescue dogs and highlight that your business donates new, homemade dog biscuits once a month when your team volunteers. If you’re a restaurant or coffee shop and you’re trying out a new menu, offer local reporters or bloggers to a special tasting event. It’s a great way to get a review in the local paper.
Measuring Results
Periodically, on a weekly basis, and also at the end of each promotion, check how your new product is performing. Clover Insights will collect your transactional data as well as customer data to help you evaluate whether you’re reaching new customers.

Did the new product or service meet your performance objectives?

If it didn’t, take the time to talk to your staff and ask their opinions on why it failed. Your staff is the front line and likely can offer insight into why customers might not have responded the way you expected.

How does it compare to your other products?

Did it perform well enough to add to your mix of products permanently? Sometimes evaluating new products against your existing products reveals low-performers that should be cut from the mix.

What do the customers think?

Gather feedback first-hand using apps such as Feedback and Customer Survey. Also train staff to ask customers what they think of the new products. Sometimes customers are interested, but don’t take advantage of a promotion because they didn’t schedule enough time in advance or because they just weren’t ready to buy. It’s important not just to collect the data, but to analyze it in the right context.
Taking all this data into consideration, it’s decision time. Hopefully your new product exceeded your expectations and met all your performance objectives. More likely than not, it’ll need to be tweaked to be made more profitable. If the results are a little less clear, brainstorm ways to take it further. Perhaps you only offer the product during certain times a year, or only in the most popular colors. Maybe the price needs raising to make it more worth your while, or lowering to entice more sales.

Now with these 5 apps from Clover you can offer a seamless restaurant experience. From online orders, to managing your franchise, to guest management, Clover has you covered. Here are 5 apps every restaurant needs from the good people at Clavo: 
Clavo Waitlist
Clavo Waitlist lets the hostess check customers in with their names and cell phone numbers. Because Clover Waitlist works together with Clover Tables, Maître D’s can give more accurate estimates of wait times and send a text message to customers when their tale is ready. Even better, unique color coding helps track how long a customer has been waiting against their estimated wait time so you don’t get unexpected negative reviews on Yelp! Once the table is ready, the host can drag and drop that guest’s name to the table where they’ve been seated and monitor service from Clavo Tables.
Clavo Tables
Clavo’s free table management app for restaurants is a one-stop control center for restaurant managers. Simply arrange your tables by section and you can seat parties easily, assign wait staff, and monitor table activity. Clavo Tables also helps you monitor service. Each stage of the customer lifecycle is shown real time: It immediately updates when a table is open, whether guests have just been seated, if they’ve ordered, paid, or the staff is clearing the table. Restaurant managers know exactly how long a table has been waiting to order, or waiting for their food. Clavo Tables also feeds into Clavo Waitlist and Clavo Order Pad for consistent guest management.
Clavo Order Pad
Clavo Order Pad allows servers to take orders right at the table and give customer exactly what they want. Gluten free? Sauce on the side? Extra pickles? Clavo apps can handle sophisticated orders with multiple modifiers and send them directly to the kitchen printer. There’s no need to type in every instruction—the entire menu is right in the app along with all possible modifications. Employees select items and it automatically moves on to the next possible modifier. Even better, customers don’t have to wait at a counter to pay—waiters can process payments right at the table. Simply click on checkout and it uses the existing clover payment API.
 
Clavo Online Order

Loyalty marketing can be just the ticket—provided, of course, that you structure your loyalty program smartly. This post gathers insights and best practices from pizza merchants across the country, for a loyalty program your customers can really sink their teeth into.
1. Encourage profitable customer behaviors.
A good loyalty program lets you customize your program however you like, so you can incentivize customers towards profitable behaviors. While pizza businesses vary, here are a few profitable actions you might focus on:

Increase “add-on” sales.  Say your goal is to encourage customers to tack on breadsticks, pasta, sodas, cookies, or salads to their pizza order. You could award bonus points for each of these add-ons, or let customers redeem points easily to score free sides.
Improve game-day sales. Pizza is always a crowd-pleaser when friends watch sports together. Try awarding double points for game-day purchases.
Boost catering sales. Many of your occasional customers buy pizza for big, group events: kids’ birthdays, office parties, and more. How many one-timers can you encourage to try your shop as a caterer?
Tap into recurring event sales. Recurring events (Friday poker night, a monthly church social or “must-see” TV parties) represent another profitable income stream. See our post The Power of Recurring Purchases for more.

2. Make sure everyone can participate.
Just about everybody eats pizza, so make sure your loyalty program is similarly accommodating. Old-fashioned paper punch cards can work, but they’re also inconvenient for customers, more prone to fraud, and offer merchants zero insights on customer buying habits. Many pizza merchants looking for a greater level of consumer insight coupled with an inclusive, accommodating program choose Clover Rewards because it works on virtually all computers and mobile devices, not just smartphones – so 100% of a shop’s customers can participate.
3. Sweeten the deal for VIPs.
Don’t be shy about bumping up rewards for customers in higher program tiers. While writing this article, we found Pizzology Craft Pizza & Pub in Carmel, IN, offering locals a free lunch special after buying 7,but regulars earned that perk even faster, after buying 6, and VIPs after buying 5. Likewise, Flying Saucer Pizza in Redmond, WA, offered a free appetizer for locals who buy 10, regulars who buy 9 and VIPs who buy 8. They also accelerate the pace of earning rewards as customers buy more pastas or salads.
4. Market spontaneously.
Pizza enjoys wide appeal because it’s an all-occasion, spontaneous food. The trick, of course, is reaching your customers at the right moment with an irresistible offer. A mobile loyalty program like Rewards enables you to forge one-to-one relationships to your best customers, improving your future marketing efforts.
Clover Rewards offers allow merchants to send specials directly to customer phones, luring them back into the shop. If you’re in a university town, try a finals week deal for a limited time. Enduring a stretch of terrible weather? Offer your customers some cold-weather comfort food with a spontaneous offer. Rewards specials work excellently to launch new menu items, too.
5. Make joining a no-brainer.
Every pizza parlor serves up a monster order occasionally. The next time a big spender walks in, briefly introduce your loyalty program and make it clear they’ll save money today just for joining. Get that customer over the initial hurdle, and chances are good you’ve engaged a profitable repeat customer for the future.
6. Nudge ‘em when they’re close to a reward.
A loyalty program study by the University of Chicago proves that customers buy 20% more product and accelerate their purchase frequency by 20% when they know they’re close to earning a reward. You can harness this motivation to your advantage in several ways. (See our post Psychological Study Shows Loyalty Programs Increase Purchases by 20% for more.)
Make sure your cashiers inform customers when they’re close to earning a reward. You might even email customers who’ve stashed a lot of loyalty points but haven’t made any recent purchases.
7. Reward customers across multiple locations.
It’s crucial that pizza chains make their loyalty programs seamless and hassle-free across multiple locations. That’s why it’s imperative that any loyalty program a pizza chain with multiple locations chooses a cloud-based loyalty program. That way a customer can reap rewards for their purchases whether at your downtown flagship or one of your suburban satellites.
The bottom line…
Pizza is a warm, comforting, social food that can engender tremendous loyalty – even evoke the taste of home. Your loyalty program should solidify already-strong customer relationships while deepening new ones.

news_306,news,4 reasons you should list your business with Apple Maps,"If you run a small business, one of the most important jobs you will undertake is getting your business found.…",24-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/4-reasons-you-should-list-your-business-with-apple-maps/,"If you run a small business, one of the most important jobs you will undertake is getting your business found. Searching for your business is one of the first steps potential customers will take before becoming actual paying customers, and it’s up to you to ensure that your business has a presence in all of the environments where people might be looking.
One key environment you’ll want to manage is Apple Maps. Here’s why.
 1. Millions of people use Apple Maps
Using a search engine is far from the only way for online users to find your business. When you consider the number of people who use mobile devices to search for, find and physically navigate to brick-and-mortar businesses, you’ll recognize the importance of capitalizing on one of the biggest mobile user bases there is: Apple users.
Consider the fact that there are hundreds of millions of iOS devices currently in market. Apple Maps is the leading map search and navigation app across Apple devices by a factor of 3x, with more than 5 billion transactions per week. This represents a sizable potential volume of daily searches in your locality, making it imperative that your business is listed correctly on Apple Maps when people search. If someone asks Siri about your location, you want your business details to be available—and accurate.
 2. Be proactive with technology 
Automatically created listings sometimes need management and enhancement from the source that knows a business best: you.
Online listings and map data are pulled from a variety of places, including tax and registration data. But sometimes details can change. As a business, you’ll want to actively check and manage your listing to make sure that it’s up-to-date and complete (What are your business hours? Do you accept Apple Pay? etc.). A listing that is out-of-date, even if only for a couple of days, can mean missed opportunities to connect with potential customers and provide them with critical information that will encourage them to choose your business—and be able to easily get in contact with you.
 3. With local listings, details matter
Yext, the listings syndication technology that Clover has partnered with to help businesses manage their Apple Maps and other online listings, conducted a study to determine whether a business’s approach to listings could make a difference for how much people engaged with that business. Yext compared listing engagement for businesses that included simple listing information (business name, address and contact only) with listing engagement for businesses that used rich listing data (including pictures, website links, accurate hours and special offers).
The more complete listings received both more listing views and more Yelp reviews. Yext calculated that, on average, adding business hours resulted in 1.84 times more listing views; including a logo resulted in 1.99 times more listing views; and adding a URL resulted in 2.14 times more listing views. Each additional view gives businesses a shot at also increasing their in-store traffic.
 4. Clover makes it easy to enhance your Apple Maps listing with our new Yext integration
You can manage your Apple Maps listing online. You can also manage your Apple Maps listing at the same time you manage your business listings in dozens of other online locations through Clover Online’s new integration with Yext.
To manage your business listing, you’ll need to visit your Clover dashboard and click the Clover Online app. Next, select “Learn more” in the Clover Online listings module, and then select “Try it Free” to claim your 30-day trial.
Once you’re in the Clover Online listings module, select “Review” to view your business information screen, where you can make changes to key information about your business including the business name, description, category, logo, address, contact information and hours. You even have the option to display a featured message touting sales and special offers, and to input special holiday hours if they deviate from your main business hours.

In one step, you can ensure the optimal information is presented to anyone searching on Apple Maps for your business, and on more than 70 other online locations where your business is listed.
And while you’re in Clover Online, consider whether other features might be useful to your business. Clover Online also offers off-the-shelf small business websites featuring a variety of professionally designed themes, e-commerce capability, automatic mobile responsiveness and payment flexibility.

news_307,news,5 benefits of credit card terminals,See how POS software and a credit card terminal keep business efficient.…,29-01-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/benefits-pos-systems-quick-serve-restaurants-qsr/,"The payment terminal can be a basic tool for safely processing credit cards. But it can also be much more: the brain center of your entire operation, handling payments, analyzing sales data, generating reports, tracking inventory, and other key jobs.
Clover’s point-of-sale system puts real power at your fingertips. It turns the traditional register into a hub for streamlining and improving every aspect of the business. In addition, it outcompetes other cloud-based POS systems in ease of use, reliability, and functionality.
Here are five ways that Clover can make your business more efficient and your life less complicated.
1. Automate time-consuming tasks.
From the very first step of setting up the system, Clover is easy and intuitive. While other vendors offer pre-configured packages and a la carte items (such as readers for chip cards, cash drawers, and printers) that must be combined with an iPad or Android device, Clover is an all-in-one processing system. It eliminates the hassle of having to cobble together mismatched hardware and software.
Once up and running, the system simplifies everyday functions. Preloaded software and free or for-purchase apps let small business owners create employee schedules, generate payroll, automate ordering for popular SKUs, craft loyalty programs, track sales and returns, restock items, and much more.
2. Gather transaction data in one spot.
Not long ago, data analytics were inaccessible to businesses using cash registers. But that’s completely changed with point-of-sale systems. Clover gathers a wealth of data and displays it in easy-to-read charts and graphs. Merchants get detailed sales reports and an instant-read dashboard that monitors key metrics, including:
Product performance—Improve stocking and marketing by identifying which items and services are selling well and which are falling behind.
Repeat and VIP customers—Create loyalty programs and personalized offers that strengthen customer relationships.
Local trends—Brainstorm ideas for increasing foot traffic by analyzing how area competitors are doing.
Cash flow—Avoid financial problems by tracking money in and out.
3. Customize with powerful apps.
In place of one-size-fits-all solutions, Clover POS terminals are easy to customize to suit a business’ needs. Check out the Clover App Market to find dozens of time-saving, efficiency-boosting apps that work seamlessly with the system. Download and test some of the newest and most popular apps, including:
Time Clock by Homebase handles critical tasks such as clocking employees in and out, tracking cash and credit card tips, generating payroll-ready timesheets, scheduling staff, managing time-off requests and shift trades, and sending people reminders an hour before their shift begins.
SimpleOrder manages inventory and purchasing for food trucks, pop-ups, and other spaces where every inch counts. With one click, the app lets merchants stock up on needed items.
Insights uses charts and graphs to pinpoint top-selling products and revenue generators, ticket sizes, number of new and returning customers, and sales over time. The app even offers neighborhood stats that show where people are spending and how your own sales stack up.
TableMapp visually maps a restaurant’s floor plan, letting employees see which tables are new, which have placed an order, and which have paid their bill—simple insights for improving service.
Coupons N’ Combos helps you sell off excess product and clear space for more profitable items by creating any combo, discount, and coupon combination imaginable.
4. Future-proof the business.
No one can afford to stagnate. That’s especially true for small businesses competing with brick and mortars, large companies, and online merchants. You need to be fast, flexible, and often operating in multiple channels.
For many businesses, that means an online presence is essential. Whether you want to expand into the digital marketplace or simply refresh a website, the Clover POS offers a one-stop solution: Clover Online Store.
The online store simplifies the process of creating a professional, personalized website with e-commerce functions. It consolidates data from both physical and digital stores, while the responsive design works on all devices. Customers get a wide variety of payment options, and are protected with end-to-end encryption and security updates.
5. Go mobile.
A five-minute wait might seem like no big deal when your staff is hustling to accommodate everyone. But customers often perceive wait times as much longer than they actually are, causing frustration and even desertions.
To keep customers happy, fast-paced businesses need to rethink the payment experience. The Clover Mobile processes every payment type reliably and safely, from any location or from multiple spots. Mobile card payments are seamlessly integrated with cash sales and register transactions.
A mobile-enabled credit card terminal goes where the customers are. Break up long lines at the counter by equipping employees with Clover handheld devices. Quicken the checkout process by bringing it tableside, or to the customer in your store or salon. Expand your operation to sell at farmer’s markets and festivals, or to launch a food truck or catering branch of the business.
Next to Clover, the standard credit card terminal looks like a lumbering dinosaur. The Clover point-of-sale system offers the speed, power, and functionality that small business owners need to compete now and into the future.

news_308,news,Get more great Yelp reviews. Here’s how.,"Inspiring enthusiastic reviews is now a crucial part of any business’s marketing plan, and with more than 80 million desktop visitors per month, Yelp is a fantastic site to engage with new and prospective customers. Here are 8 ways to get more great Yelp reviews.  …",01-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/get-great-yelp-reviews-heres/,"According to recent research, more than 90 percent of customers read online reviews before making a purchase decision and up to 80 percent trust reviews as much as a personal recommendation. Inspiring enthusiastic reviews is now a crucial part of any business’s marketing plan, and with more than 80 million desktop visitors per month, Yelp is a fantastic site to engage with new and prospective customers. Here are eight ways to get more great Yelp reviews.
1. Offer a memorable experience.
This should go without saying, but the best way to get good reviews is through exceptional service and truly unique experiences. Brainstorm with staff ways to make your customers feel special—a shoulder massage with a manicure, mints after a meal, turn-down service at the end of the night. Sometimes it’s the little things that make all the difference. Then train all your staff to give the kind of customer service that inspires five-star reviews.
2. Make sure your Yelp profile is complete.
After claiming your business, be sure to verify your address (including making sure the map pin is correct). Then add all appropriate categories in your profile to make sure you show up in local searches. Add business hours, your website and phone number, the full menu of products or services, and business information such as whether you take reservations, accept credit cards, and are wheelchair accessible. The more information you have in Yelp the more discoverable you are to new customers.
3. Appeal to the senses.
Try adding photos not just of the interior and exterior of the building, but also of your products, employees, and (with permission) your customers enjoying your products. Professional, eye-catching photos can really help you stand out. When evaluating restaurants, for example, customers will often want to know what the outside of the building looks like, what kind of atmosphere it has, and whether the food looks good. Entice them to try your business with beautiful images.
4. Differentiate yourself on Yelp.
In the “From the Business” section, tell your unique story. Why did you start your business? Do you make everything by hand? Are you still serving grandma’s special recipe? Do you support social causes or use only natural materials? In this section, succinctly state what makes your business special and why should people come to you instead of the competition. Customers have choices, so having an authentic and clear value proposition can help you stand out.
5. Promote your Yelp page…carefully.
Yelp has very strict guidelines on how to promote your page, and their software actively looks for reviews that appear to be solicited. (Here’s a list of tips to avoid hurting your Yelp rating.) It’s perfectly fine to promote that you have a page, but it’s not OK to ask for reviews on Yelp. Add Yelp signage in your business, on your receipts, and at the bottom of every email. You can say things like “Check us out on Yelp” or “Find us on Yelp,” but avoid specifically asking for reviews, or worse, offering anything in exchange for a review.
6. Encourage Yelp usage.
Want to subtly encourage repeat and loyal customers to leave reviews? Integrate your mobile booking software with Yelp. Apps like Booker allow customers to book their next appointment right off your Yelp page. It’s convenient for customers because they can schedule complex requests (such as sitting at a specific table or requesting a particular staff member) right in an app they are probably already using. It cuts down on unnecessary phone calls to your business and helps you build up customer profiles by porting all the appointment and user data right over to your Clover station. Even better, when customers are done booking their appointment, they’re thinking of you and your exceptional service while viewing your Yelp page. With a few clicks they can add their own review easily.
7. Interact with reviewers.
Show you care and are involved with your customers by responding to reviews on Yelp. You don’t need to respond to every review, but take the time to thank enthusiastic reviews and to respond to questions. This is a great way to also let your personality shine through. Don’t get angry or defensive over negative reviews—this sets the wrong tone. Investigate what went wrong and respond carefully. Follow up with your staff about any comments that seem off—is your customer service slipping? Do you need to staff up during busy periods? A quick apology and simple explanation along with an invitation to come back can go a long way. (Check out our advice on how to handle negative reviews.)
8. Be accessible.
The more approachable you are, the more ways for customers to engage with you, the less likely they’ll resort to social media to post negative comments. No business, no matter how diligent, has 100 percent perfect service 24/7. Make sure the customer knows what to do if they aren’t satisfied including how to get in touch with you. Consider apps such as Feedback, which invites every customer to leave feedback through a link on their receipt. Or consider a mobile app version of a comment card, such as Tattle-Feedback & Loyalty, which allows you to create surveys, respond privately, and track responses using analytics. When you get instant feedback you can respond right away to make things right and win back a customer.

This article explains the method, and how Clover can help you achieve it.…",02-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/david-allens-getting-things-done-methodology-small-business-owners/,"Running a small business is no joke. You have to wear so many hats, and constantly switch between them. Within the span of an afternoon you might have to be a salesperson on the floor, a negotiator with a supplier, a warehouse manager, a customer service representative, a bookkeeper, a social media manager, and an HR supervisor.
With those kinds of responsibilities, productivity is key. There are a number of systems and philosophies out there, but one of the most popular and enduring is David Allen’s Getting Things Done methodology. The 5 simple steps can be adapted to meet different needs, so regardless of any details of your particular business, there’s a good chance this system can apply to you.
David Allen’s 5-step method for Getting Things Done (GTD)
1. Capture: Collect what has your attention
Maintain a living document of tasks that you can add to wherever you are. If a task can be completed in under 2 minutes, just do it! If not, put it on the list.
2. Clarify: Process what each list item means and the amount of time it takes to do that task
Review your tasks, and make sure that they are specific and detailed. You don’t want to spend time trying to decode a task, you want to spend your time completing them! Also take a moment to establish a timeline or a deadline by which the task must be completed.
3. Organize: Put it where it belongs
Figure out the best way to organize your tasks. Perhaps it’s by location, what you can delegate, or the best time of day to address them.
4. Reflect: Review frequently
Take a few minutes each day to review your ongoing task list and make sure your priorities are in order. Perhaps you can identify what you hope to accomplish each day, or each week.
5. Engage: Simply do
Complete the tasks! Delegate what you are able to, but complete those within your domain with focus and direction. You don’t want to have to return to the task if it isn’t absolutely necessary.
How Clover can help
Clover can’t do all of your work for you, but it can save you time…lots of time. By some calculations, up to 1,352 hours per year! Aside from automating tasks like managing inventory and distributing schedules, Clover can actually help you engage with the GTD method.
Most business owners are constantly shifting between their devices during their workday (and at home). SimpliDone by Infuse is a task manager and to do list that automatically syncs across all of your platforms. You can use it to capture tasks whether it’s on your phone, in front of your laptop, or at your Clover station. As you organize your tasks, and complete them, you can mark them as finished within the app, immediately updating other platforms as well.
Some of your tasks might involve conveying information to the rest of your staff as well. Consider trying SimpliNotes (from the same developer as SimpliDone) to create notes from anywhere that instantly sync to all of your Clover stations. Want to update your opening or closing checklists? It’s a breeze!
Reports show that 92% of small businesses are using some form of cloud business solutions, but not all of them are using them to capacity. Be smart about how you use your powerful Clover software, and engage the GTD system to maximize your time for creative thought, personal time, and whatever else holds value to you!

news_310,news,Growing pains: Training staff to cover for you while on vacation,"Now is the perfect time to escape the cold winter weather and recharge with a little sun and sand. Yet, by some estimates, less than half of small business owners will take an entire week off for vacation during the year. Sound like you? Allow us to change your mind. 
…",05-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-training-staff-cover-vacation/,"Have you caught yourself staring longingly at pictures of the beach? Holiday season is over and now is the perfect time to escape the cold and recharge. Yet, by some estimates, less than half of small business owners will take an entire week off for vacation during the year. Sound like you? Allow us to change your mind.
There are real benefits to stepping away from your business and onto a beach for a few days. Stress reduction can seriously boost your health, both physically and mentally. In one study, doctors found that vacationers had fewer headaches, backaches, and heart irregularities—and they still felt these benefits five weeks after returning from a break. Skipping vacation can make make you 30% more likely to suffer heart attack. And, while you might feel like a slacker for stepping away from your business, taking vacation actually improves productivity. One study discovered that for every 10 hours of vacation employees took, their performance improved by 8%.
Still not convinced that you can take a vacation and come back stronger than ever? Many merchants are hesitant to leave their business to their employees. You may hire stellar people, but handing your team the keys to the castle when you aren’t around is a different proposition. Here’s how to leave with confidence.
Monitor from afar with Clover apps
Clover is here to help you automate key tasks and keep tabs on your business. Leave with peace of mind that even while you’re sunning yourself in the sand, your business isn’t going up in flames without your knowledge. These apps can help you take time off without living in fear.

Time Clock by Homebase: Managers can view the sales, labor costs, and timesheets (including break times), all manageable from a phone. Use this app to check on your employee schedules, time tracking, overtime, and more. The GPS mobile time clock makes it easy to keep up on your team remotely.
Ping Me If: A common concern among merchants is theft (either monetary or inventory) by employees while the boss is away. Ping Me If can notify you if an employee “pockets” cash. Know when cash removed your cash drawer, an item is deleted from inventory, or if an order stays open too long. Plus, if an employee knows you’re monitoring, they will not be tempted to lift cash.
Stock: Monitor the total inventory at your store from a distance. This handy app will keep track of your product quantities and purchase orders. It shows you the available quantity, expiration date, and sales history for each product. If you’re a restaurant owner, you can use Stock to track inventory by ingredients/recipe. For example, you can set up the app so when an employee sells a mixed drink, the Stock app will tell you how much liquid is deducted correctly.

Prepare accordingly with training
Of course, managing from a distance isn’t really the point of going on vacation. Automation can only get you so far—then, it’s up to your employees to hold down the fort. Use this time to step away and give your employees a chance to shine. Do you have the right person in place to manage the team while you’re OOO? Here’s how to find the right manager for your small business. Ask them these interview questions to make sure you’ve done your due diligence in seeking the best person for your unique enterprise. Start by delegating to your manager: follow these steps to make sure you’re setting up your proxy for success. Lastly, empower your employees to showcase their talent. Your vacation is the perfect opportunity for the team to use their strengths. According to Gallup research, workers who use their best skills every day are six times more likely to be engaged employees. More engaged employees? Well, that’s just great for business.
Enjoy your vacation
The last step in preparing to go on vacation is committing to true enjoyment. Clover apps have your operations covered, and you’ve invested the time in finding and trusting the right people to run your business. Try to relax when you clock out for a few days: to truly see the benefits of vacation, you need a mental break! Vacation is not a time to micromanage, but a time to rest, relax, and recharge. We’ll see you when you get back!

news_311,news,Business problem turnaround: Handling a serious customer complaint,Some problems go from bad to worst-case scenario almost immediately. Which is why a serious complaint demands an equally serious response. Here’s what to do when a nightmare scenario becomes real life.…,07-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-handling-serious-customer-complaint/,"Every merchant knows that dealing with customer complaints comes with the territory of owning your business. Some critiques are legitimate—no matter how hard you work to provide top-notch customer service, mistakes and accidents are bound to occur. Other grievances? Not so much. It is, after all, impossible to please absolutely everyone.
When complaints arise, the key is to act swiftly and remain professional to rectify the situation and minimize any potential long-term damage. Because, as you probably know, consumers are significantly more likely to tell others about bad customer experiences than share the good moments.
Clover Online Listings helps you stay on top of what your customers are saying about your business. It combs a network of the 20 top review sites, including Yelp and TripAdvisor, and automatically pings you when there’s new activity about your business. It also eliminates the need to log into multiple sites by enabling you to respond to reviews directly from the Clover Online app.
But some problems go from bad to worst-case scenario almost instantly. Maybe a customer is sickened and hospitalized with food poisoning from eating at your restaurant. Perhaps a negative review goes viral on social media. When one of these nightmare scenarios becomes real life, what’s a small business owner to do?
A serious complaint demands an equally serious response. And the traditional actions you typically take—being empathetic and offering a sincere apology—after a complaint might not suffice. When you find yourself coming up short, consider the following remedies.
Hold focus groups
Typically used by large companies, focus groups can be an easy, affordable way for small businesses to learn about their customers. These face-to-face gatherings provide powerful insight into customer beliefs and allow you to hear exactly what they want—instead of taking a guess and possibly missing the mark. If you have a large problem, gather a group of your VIPs and engage in an honest dialogue. Their real-time feedback can help you figure out a customer-friendly solution. Afterwards, be sure to share out the actions you took as a result of their input. Doing so will deepen their loyalty to you and your business.
Retool company policies
Smart small business owners have company policies clearly outlined in writing. Formal guidelines and procedures for onboarding, employee training, safety, and returns and refunds, among others, help you run a tight ship. But that doesn’t mean you set them and forget about them. A company handbook should be regularly reviewed and updated. Outdated policies can leave your organization vulnerable as it matures and shifts in this ever-changing business climate. When a serious customer complaint is lodged, determine which policies are applicable and which ones should be reconsidered. Use the experience to help shape policy tweaks, with the hope being that the changes you implement will prevent a similar situation from repeating itself in the future.
Hire professional media relations
Posting photos of your culinary delights. Checking in at your boutique. Giving a shout-out about a long-lasting manicure. Writing a glowing online review. It’s great that your customers show you the love on social media. These endorsements outweigh any marketing or advertising campaign—and they are free! The downside, however, is when a customer uses Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Yelp to attack your business and the post goes viral. In those instances, the old adage of “any press is good press” doesn’t hold true. And your traditional responses won’t, either. Hire a freelance social media strategist or sign on with a marketing agency to provide crisis management services. They will break through the angry online crowd by designing and executing a well-thought out, creative response. This lets customers know you’re listening to their concern and changing how you do business.
Own your failures
Sometimes, the best way to move forward from a colossal complaint is to turn your shortcomings into a means to reinvigorate your business. Pizza giant Domino’s did just that after a new CEO took the reigns in 2010. Instead of quietly improving its product, the company created a courageous ad campaign that shared focus group comments about its food, including “worst pizza I ever had” and “the crust tastes like cardboard.” This transparency—and a promise to make better pizza—fueled the company’s resurgence.
Fire a manager
Managers are your most valuable employees. They can make your business, but they can also break it, too. And according to Gallup, 82 percent of companies do not hire the right manager. Bad managers lead to low employee satisfaction and engagement. And disengaged, unhappy employees make mistakes—often large ones. If you’re getting complaints about your waitstaff on a regular basis, for instance, it’s likely not your employees that need replacement, but your manager. It’s never pleasant to terminate someone, but sometimes it’s the only action you can take to improve the health of your business.
Get legal advice
Some types of small businesses have higher liability risks than others. (Think: restaurant and daycare owners.) If you have a waiter who doesn’t note to omit peanuts from a dish and a customer experiences a life-threatening allergic reaction, you could be legally responsible. Same holds true if one of your stylists drops a razor and hurts a client, or a product you manufactured malfunctions, injuring someone. As a merchant, you need to protect your business—and yourself—in the instance that a customer sues you for damages. Reach out to legal counsel immediately instead of trying to handle the situation yourself. Sole proprietors are particularly vulnerable, as their personal assets could be at risk if they’re sued.
No one wants to be confronted with a serious customer complaint. Large problems don’t have to be business killers, though. How you respond will largely determine if your company can rebound. By following these tips, your business could emerge stronger than ever.

news_312,news,5 questions to ask a potential investor in your business,"An investor can provide just what you need—capital—but not every business pairing is a match made in heaven. These five questions can help you land the perfect mate. 
…",08-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-potential-investor-business/,"Much like it takes a village to raise a child, launching a small business isn’t a solo endeavor. The employees that are cutting hair in your salon, providing in-person tech support to clients, or dishing up fro-yo at your downtown eatery are the faces of your business. But behind the scenes may be the people that provide the most support to your small business: your financial investors.
An investor can provide just what you need—capital—but not every business pairing is a match made in heaven. As you might know from your personal life, mixing love and money is tricky. Pick the wrong investor and your business (aka: your passion) could suffer—or worse, go belly up.
Read on for five questions to help you land the perfect mate.
1. Do you need to see a formal business plan?
Traditional business acumen says that you need to have a formal, well-written business plan to present to a potential investor. This blueprint of your business lays out your goals and the strategies and tactics that you’re going to use to achieve them. But a surprising study from Babson University finds that unless you need significant funds or you are trying to woo an institutional investor (and you’re likely not), there’s no compelling reason to write a detailed business plan.
A business plan can be dozens of pages long and can take months to prepare. If a potential investor is okay with you presenting your business idea in a less formal way—like a PowerPoint presentation—why not take them up on it? You’ll still need to set goals and have a strategy for how you’re going to achieve them. And you’ll need to figure out how you’re going to convince someone that you’re worth investing in. But you can communicate your ideas in a document that’s significantly less time-consuming to create.
2. What kind of investment do you want to make?
Whether you’re looking for an investor to launch your business or you’re hoping to find someone that can help you grow your existing company, it’s important to find out what kind of ownership interests them: equity or debt. Those that give you cash in exchange for a percentage of the profits (and any losses) are equity investors. Typically when opening a new business, the percentage an equity investor receives is proportional to the overall amount needed to launch the business. For example, an investor gives you $140,000. You kick in an additional $560,000. That means they own 20 percent and you own the remaining 80 percent. If you’re an established business owner, an equity investor might be willing to put up the vast majority of the capital needed, but receive a disproportionate percentage of the returns. In either instance, being an equity financier makes them more vulnerable to risk—but there’s also more opportunity for larger gains.
Investors that are less willing to take risks will want to make a debt investment in your small business. Accept a loan from a debt investor and you’ll be on the hook for interest payments, as well as repayment of the principal. The investor could also ask you to secure the debt with your property. If your business goes bust and they have a lien on your building (or worse, your house!), they could claim your property if you fail to pay back the money. Financiers of established businesses might forgo securing their debt since they are investing in your company’s good name.
3. How much are you looking to invest?
You’ve always been told that it isn’t polite to talk about money. That way of thinking certainly doesn’t hold true when you’re a small business owner. While great, it’s not enough that someone is interested in financing your business. They need to provide an amount that you deem sufficient as well. Get down to specifics and ask a potential investor how much cash they’re willing to give you. You may be looking for $200,000 and they’re only willing to part with $15,000. If that’s the case, it’s best to know upfront. That way, you can move on quickly or hustle even more to find additional investors or alternative means of funding, like Clover Capital or a small business loan, that can make up the difference.
Looking to divest your ownership of a business that is under performing? In this instance, you might need to be more flexible in negotiating how much money you’re willing to accept. That’s because the financier, not you, is likely in the position of power.
4. What do you think should be done with the profits?
Success in business can come with its own set of problems, namely what you’re going to do with any profit once all overhead is paid. Some owners will want to receive cash in hand; others will think that it should be reinvested in the business (for upgrades, expansion, etc.). There is no right answer about what to do with your profits, but the answer could determine if and how fast the business could grow. (If you never make additional investments, growth is unlikely.) This is also worth mentioning because it’s important that both you and your investor are on the same page. Otherwise, this conflict could carry over into other areas of the business.
5. What kinds of interactions do you have with founders after investing?
Are you looking for a co-owner in name only? Or is this your first foray into entrepreneurship and you’re looking for an investor/mentor? Some investors are extremely hands on and want to be consulted before any decision involving the business is made. They may even introduce you to others (potential investors, suppliers, workers, etc.) in their network. Others, not so much. They’re more of the silent partner type. You probably have an idea about what you’re looking for, so asking up front will give you an understanding about what kind of relationship you’re entering into. If it’s a match made in heaven, it could mean good things for both your bank accounts.

news_315,news,MVP: Clover Online’s Click and Collect for retail,"Here are some simple ways the convenience of in store pickup can increase sales and expand your relationship with customers.
…",15-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/mvp-clover-onlines-click-collect-retail/,"Did you know that Clover Online includes Store Pickup? It’s a feature included in the Pro Plan that allows customers to pay for items online and then pick them up from the store. Also known as “Click and Collect,” it’s an excellent way to help local patrons shop from the convenience of their home or office without having to pay for shipping—which can add up to $20 to a purchase. Installing this feature can help you do more than remain competitive with big box stores who offer similar services. Used the right way, it can also help increase sales and differentiate you from your most fierce competitors.
The first step to discovering new ways to use Store Pickup is considering the buying behavior of your customers. What combinations of items are they purchasing most often and when? You can find this information easily through Clover Insights, which provides an idea of customer activity and product-level insights. Once you’ve identified patterns, the fun begins. Here are two ways “Click and Collect” can expand the way you sell to your best customers.
Prepackaged kits for convenience
Imagine what it takes to prepare for a picnic or a trip to the beach to celebrate the Fourth of July. You might need suntan lotion, blankets, a cooler, tupperware, plates, napkins, and more. Make it easy for busy shoppers to “grab and go” by offering these items in a prepackaged kit that could be picked up on the way home from work or even on the way to the party. Switch out kits at the end of the summer for Back to School packs that might include bookbags, pencils, notebooks and a lunchbox. Eliminate roaming the aisles and worrying about getting the last items in stock. You could even expand shopper consideration sets by including new pieces that customers would not normally consider.
Offer a class
If your regulars find you particularly talented at what you do, try to expand your relationship by offering a class to help them build a better appreciation for your craft. Offer pre-packaged supplies so your new students can follow along while you teach a new skill and share your creative process. As their enthusiasm grows, consider offering intermediate and advanced classes. You might also want to focus on a special skill that requires a particular set of tools. Maintain the interest in their new hobby going by offering kits that include all the materials and instructions needed to finish a particular project.
When in doubt you can always talk to your customers. Ask them if they’d appreciate Store Pickup and how they would use it. Together you might uncover even more unexpected ideas that were never even on your radar.

The company took advantage of Clover’s reach among small businesses to quickly get their innovative product to market. CEO Jeff Witten and team soon realized they could build a smart customer communication and loyalty capability into CoinOut based on consumers’ and merchants’ real-world interactions with the technology.
Millions of viewers were introduced to CoinOut during its star turn on ABC’s Shark Tank, which aired on President’s Day weekend. Jeff’s convincing pitch earned the company a $250,000 investment for 15 percent equity from Robert Herjavec. We spoke with Jeff about how he and his team formed their pitch in preparation for a high-stakes, high-visibility moment; why Clover was such an integral partner in helping their company launch and continue to scale; and how CoinOut is bridging a chasm between cash transactions and digital payments. 
CoinOut team members and supporters gather in Manhattan to watch CEO Jeffrey Witten’s pitch on Shark Tank, Sunday, February 18, 2018. Photo courtesy Jeffrey Witten.
Andaiye Taylor: How did CoinOut’s appearance on Shark Tank come to be?
Jeffrey Witten: We were [already] thinking about ways that we could grow the business when we were contacted by a producer on the show following a press piece on us in Fast Company in the fall of 2016. They say that they get something like 40,000 applications a year, and they accept only a handful, so the odds are pretty low. Going in, we thought we had a decent shot, but I wasn’t by any means expecting we’d get through. After several months we found out the good news, and we were super excited.
Andaiye: When you guys were preparing your pitch, what were the two or three things about CoinOut that you absolutely wanted to convey to the Sharks?
Jeff: I think for us, the big issue that we needed to communicate was that other than just payments and thinking about cash, the big opportunity was for large and small merchants to take advantage of digital tools for customers that aren’t on a smartphone app or aren’t using a retail or loyalty app.
In the payment space, the percentage of people that are actually doing online transactions in-store is low. Even Starbucks, which is the most successful, only captures 30 percent of their transactions as a digital stamp on the customer. For us that is a massive opportunity. We had to communicate that opportunity in a way that people who aren’t payment experts could understand.
And the second objective was to talk about the massive customer problem and issues around dealing with cash. The anecdotal evidence that I think is really persuasive is the fact that Coinstar, which does coin conversion, is a $3 billion-a-year business. They’re taking a fee for simply saying, “We’re going to take your money and we’re going to convert it into usable money.”
[Dealing with cash] was something that was inherently disconnected from a payment experience that should be really good, where the customer is feeling great about their interaction with a merchant, particularly in local business, where customers are visiting every day or couple of days.
Andaiye: When you’re talking about CoinOut and what its prospects look like, how does your integration with Clover factor in?
Jeff: I think Clover was extremely important for us, and still is extremely important for us, because it was the one place where we could build a fully integrated solution in a cost-effective way, that let us actually put something in the field and get real feedback on it.
Clover is clearly unique in the way they set up the Clover App Market. The fact that they have growing distribution where, for a small startup, you can build something, put it out there, and then iterate and get feedback as people are using it. Clover was extremely important. It was really our first legitimate deployment.
Moving forward, it means distribution for us. Part of our pitch is the fact that the industry is growing and moving towards technologies like Clover that are fully integrated, and give tools directly to the local merchant that are not the old way of doing things–the old massive POS that costs thousands and thousands of dollars.
Andaiye: Outside of actually preparing your pitch, how else did you prepare for your appearance? Did you watch old videos like people do when they’re preparing for a sports contest?
Jeff: We took at least a month of full preparation. If you ever watch the show, you know the standard questions you’re going to get. And then when you reflect on your business, you know where you’re vulnerable and where they’re going to pry.
So we spent a ton of time rehearsing and coming up with a real story for why we’ve done what we’ve done, and I think Clover ties in nicely to that story. But really, it was being true to what we’ve built so far, what the mission is, and trying to evangelize the fact that the industry is moving in this direction, and there’s great momentum behind it.
Andaiye: What can you tell me about your experience taping Shark Tank and what it was like to be actually on the set and filming?
Jeff: I can say how I felt while I was on the set. When you look at the show, in many cases it’s make or break [for the companies that are pitching]. It wasn’t make or break for us, but we had to figure out a way to get really focused to make sure we were conveying what we wanted to convey, because we only had one shot.
Were there nerves? Certainly. But I think with any sort of big shot, the adrenaline kicks in and takes over. I think that the stage and the nerves just sort of pumped in, and all of that additional adrenaline helped get me focused.
Andaiye: Were you already a fan of the show when you started preparing?
Jeff: I was a big fan; I’ve always been a big fan. I think it’s been part of the reason I got into entrepreneurship, as I think it is with a lot of people in the country. You hear the stories about small businesses and see how well they do. I think it’s also become a lot easier to start businesses with the decreasing cost of software. The show has had a big impact on my journey.
Andaiye: You graduated from Columbia University with dual business and law degrees. Did the idea for CoinOut come to you during that experience?
Jeff: Yes. When I was a first-year law student I was on track to become a standard corporate lawyer, and I decided I didn’t want to go down that path.
I ended up doing the joint business degree, and had the opportunity after my first year of law school to go work at Apple. And while I was there I got involved in payment technology. We were looking at broader trends in the smartphone market, and one of those trends was prepaid phones and cash.
I got hooked on the fact that everyone was assuming that mobile payments were going to take over, but a huge swath of evidence was suggesting that cash was extremely sticky. People hadn’t figured out how to bridge the cash transaction to a digital world. And that’s where the idea came about. In business school, I had the ability to incubate it and slowly work out the details.
Andaiye: What are the use cases for CoinOut in terms of data, analytics, marketing and other ways businesses can benefit from the technology?
Jeff: We now allow merchants that use CoinOut to control and see CoinOut transactions through our iOs or Android app. And they now have a tool where they can create a promotion within the app and promote that with one click. It’s a one-to-one marketing tool for the merchant.
The merchant has full analytics within our app where they can see the sales that are linked to CoinOut customers. They can go into the app, they can see their sales, and they can say, “I’m going to promote this time [to come into our location] or this coupon,” and with one click, we send out those messages to the customers. It’s been highly effective to get those customers back in the store and spending money.
Another feature is that now customers, when they have the money saved to their CoinOut account, they can actually spend it back at the store. Merchants will have these customers that have this “found money” that’s sitting on their phone, and they can now close the loop and say to the customer, “Hey, you’ve got money on your phone. Come back and spend it here.” We charge zero percent processing fee for those transactions.
Andaiye: Anything else planned from here on out? In general, it seems like there are a lot of possibilities for CoinOut.
Jeff. We actually also have a cashback product. Customers can download the CoinOut app and scan their receipts at certain retailers to get a little bit of cash back.
If a customer claims the reward, that transforms into CoinOut cash, and the merchant then has the ability to do all those communicative things I mentioned about getting the customer back in the store.
Andaiye: I’m curious whether the new features that you’re talking about now, or that you plan to release in the future, were part of the original plan or revealed themselves as the app has been in market.
Jeff: Definitely. Our company is all about listening, getting feedback and building based on legitimate usage and feedback from customers and merchants. So we’ve had certain ideas from the get-go, but this implementation of it is not what we originally anticipated. It’s colored by what we’ve heard and how we’ve seen people use the product, and the questions and comments we’ve gotten.
Andaiye: Do you think CoinOut has a significant growth opportunity?
Jeff: Yes. We’ve had a couple Clover merchants in New York, in our backyard, that we use as our sandbox environment, and we’ve been remodeling the product and gearing up for a relaunch. So in terms of scale and where we want to be, we’re really excited about what the Shark Tank airing will do for our business, and then carry that momentum through to then scale appropriately. We’re really lucky that we have this great publicity event.
Andaiye: Related question about user acquisition: are you guys thinking about going straight to consumer? Do you think that the merchants are going to be the primary vector for acquiring users, or is it a mix of both?
Jeff: It’s a mix of both, but the good thing is that because of this receipt product, we’re going to have a lot of users that are engaged and using the product already. If customers are using the product and they want to see it in more places, they can go to their local merchant and say, “Hey, I want CoinOut in here.”
There’s an old story about Mastercard. Mastercard was trying [to make inroads with] local merchants a long time ago, and they asked them if they would accept Mastercard and the merchants said, “No way.” So then they gave out pre-loaded Mastercards to everyone in town and said, “Hey, go spend this at these merchants.” Everyone was coming in and trying to pay with Mastercards, and at the end of the day there’s now built-up demand.
That’s something we’re trying to achieve. Get this big customer base, drive that usage. For the merchants, we’ve now changed the product so that the merchant understands that the more customers they get using CoinOut, the more they have the ability to send, in one click, those promotions to get the customers back in store and to spend this money that’s saved.
I think a combination of those factors will add user acquisition. We set up the tool so that merchants get more value when there are more customers on it. This tool enables merchants to see CoinOut customer sales in real-time. They have the tools in their hand to promote the business to customers who use cash, who they don’t otherwise have a communication channel with.

Patron Connect, Split Pay & Tips, SimpliBoard, and Text Alerts are four must haves that will help you and your team work more efficiently — no matter what business you’re in.
…",20-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-clover-app-market-february-2018/,"As you get rolling into 2018, we know you have a lot of irons in the fire. And chances are that maintaining productivity is at the top of that list. With your Clover POS system and the Clover App Market, you have an invaluable resource right at your fingertips that’s constantly being refreshed with apps specifically designed to help you get paid, sell more, and run your business better.
Every month we like to highlight a few of the new and notable apps that are quickly becoming some of our merchants’ favorites. Whether you’re running a restaurant, managing a retail outlet or just wanting to work more efficiently, these apps can help you do it.
Patron Connect
Want to give your customers greater control of their dining experience, drive more revenue, and market your restaurant to a new audience? Patron Connect lets your customers place orders and submit payment right from their mobile device. With this app from the Clover App Market, all of your mobile orders will come straight through your POS device, whether it’s a Clover Station, Clover Mini, or even a Clover Mobile.
Businesses that use order and pay ahead apps have been shown to have a 20% increase in ticket size, and the Patron Connect platform is a fantastic way to reach new audiences. You can even use the app’s Deal Feed to promote specials and events to Patron Connect users. Download the Clover app for free, and when it is installed, a Patron Connect representative will walk you through your various options for customization.
Split Pay & Tips
Do your customers and servers struggle with split checks? Not anymore! Split Pay & Tips allows servers to make payment more convenient for customers. It also allows for simple tip tracking to make sure all of your employees receive the tips they deserve while ensuring customers don’t have to worry about having the proper coins and cash.
You’re going to love the flexibility Split Pay & Tips offers. It lets you choose to split checks evenly, or itemize them for specific amounts. And, since it’s not just servers that deserve tips, it lets you collect tips for various employees, like shampoo assistant at a salon or any other individual employee. You can track all tips and generate tip summaries at the end of each day.
SimpliBoard
Staying organized is imperative for sustained success. That’s why there are apps like SimpliBoard. SimpliBoard allows for good organization and communication with a variety of notes and organized folders. You can track both short- and long-term projects, and generate checklists or repetitive tasks. It’s the perfect app for businesses with a lot of moving parts—florists, cleaners, restaurants, and more.
SimpliBoard also lets you easily organize tasks into To Do, In Progress, and Done so the status on each task is crystal clear. With a basic subscription, you can store boards locally on each device, but a Plus subscription syncs boards across all devices, including web platforms. If you’re using David Allen’s Getting Things Done methodology, this will be a huge help!
Text Alerts
When you’re running your own business, nothing beats being in the know. That’s why there’s Text Alerts. Text Alerts is a customizable app that you can set to trigger texts or emails when any number of events takes place in your store. It’s a great way to manage efficiently and stay on top of things if you are moving between locations or working off site some of the time.
Text Alerts can trigger a message when any number of preset events take place, including an order over a specified amount is paid, a credit card transaction over a specific amount is voided, payment is made by check (helpful if you are concerned about fraud), and when new items are added to inventory.
You already have Clover in your corner. So make sure you get the most out of it with these apps (and more like them) in the Clover App Market.

news_318,news,Business scenario: Organizing your tax info,"Tax time every year is either stressful, expensive, time-consuming, or some combination of all three. But doing a little prep work in advance can help streamline the process and reduce your stress. …",21-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-organizing-tax-info/,"Nobody likes tax time. Every year it’s either stressful, expensive, time-consuming, or some combination of all three. But doing a little prep work in advance can help streamline the process and reduce your stress. Being more organized with your financial information might even save you money. After all, you can’t take deduct an expense you haven’t recorded.
No matter what your situation, the best way to organize your tax-time information is to automate it as much as possible. For example, a modern POS system like Clover can automatically sync all your sales records with QuickBooks or another accounting system. Inventory tracking apps can help you keep track of how much you had to start the year and how much you purchased along the way. Whenever possible, choose apps that work together and work with your accounting software, to minimize the potential for mistakes when you manually enter information.
Here are some tips for organizing your tax information to simplify the tax prep process as much as possible:
If you file your own taxes
Filing your own small business taxes may sound daunting, but it’s definitely doable if you have the right tools. You’ll want to gather all the information you might need in advance, so you’re not scrambling to find a receipt while you’re in the middle of some complex math. A checklist like this one will help you get organized, but what you’ll need basically breaks down into three categories: your business income, your inventory costs, and your other expenses (wages, rent, insurance, and so on). That means you’ll need to gather records of all your sales for the year, receipts for inventory purchases, W2s and 1099s for employees and contractors, and records of all other expenses.
If you’ve been stuffing all your receipts in a shoebox up until now, don’t panic—now is a great time to start transitioning to an automated system. For this year, organize your paper files (separate income, expenses, and legal/tax documents) and then scan as many receipts and other documents as you can, so that you have backups of everything. Start automating your accounting now, and next year’s tax season will be that much easier.
If you work with an accountant
Working with a pro can take a lot of the stress and hassle off your plate. But it also makes the shoebox method of accounting a lot more troublesome. When you work with a pro, you need to make sure all your documents and records are accessible and easy for someone who isn’t inside your head to understand.
Chances are, your accountant will have his or her own system—they may give you a checklist of documents to scan or forms to fill out. But one very easy way to work with a pro is to simply give them access to your QuickBooks account, or whatever accounting software and record-keeping you’re using. That way, they have all the information at their fingertips, and they can use more of their time and energy looking for deductions and helping you minimize your tax bill. Again, if you’re disorganized this year, don’t despair—take a weekend to get your documents together for this year’s taxes, and then transition to an automated system for next year. Your accountant will thank you.
If you’re just starting out
If you’re used to filing taxes as an employee, with payroll taxes deducted for you, your first year filing for a new business can be difficult. But if you’re starting a new business, now is the time to start off on the right foot and get organized from day one.
Your best bet is to automate as much as possible. Track everything—your inventory, your expenses like travel, meals, and healthcare, and your business income. Many people find it’s easier to open up a separate account for their small business, so the income and expenses are easier to track. You might also find using a separate credit card for business expenses helps keep you organized.
Start out by automating, and then check in on your system at least once a quarter to make sure there weren’t any expenses or other information left out. When you use the right tools, filing your business taxes can almost be easy. Almost.

news_319,news,Crowd pleasers: Hosting a class for customers,"Battle winter boredom by offering ways for your customers to learn! Classes and workshops are a great way to reward your best customers, showcase your products, and bring new clients through the door. Learn how to make the most ROI from your class with these tips and ideas. …",22-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-hosting-class-customers/,"Right about now is when most people start to break their New Year’s resolutions (if they didn’t already in the second week of January). This means if you’re a small business, now is also the time to engage customers with some fun, educational opportunities to inspire (or reward) customer loyalty.
Battle that mid-winter sales slump by finding new ways to entertain your clientele. Host a workshop, DIY session, or free class to promote your products, showcase your service, and drive sales, all while doing some sneaky marketing that will deepen customer loyalty.
While hosting a workshop can seem like a lot of effort, the return on investment with this form of marketing speaks for itself. The brains at Harvard Business Review discovered that increasing customer retention by just 5% can lead to a 25-95% increase in profits. One of the most powerful ways to retain customers? Give customers one-on-one attention, reward VIPs with exclusive access to your business, or show customers ways to get the best value from your offering through workshops and classes.
There are three key ways to make sure you get the most value from your workshop:

Treat your VIPs like VIPs.

Some classes may be exclusively open to your very best customers. Treat them like the royalty they are by giving them early access to a new product or letting them preview a new service. These are the customers who will evangelize your business to the great wide world. Clover Rewards can help you identify VIPs and advertise your special program to them through email and posts to Facebook and Twitter.

Activate your network of referrals.

Classes are a great way to get new customers through the door! Offer a discounted entry to any customers who bring a friend. It’s an easy way to show your stuff to people may already have your business on their radar—and haven’t committed to becoming a customer yet.

Integrate your product/service into the workshop.

Testing a new recipe at your cafe? Trying out a brand of shampoo in your salon? Use this time to test new products and services and get feedback from the people who are rooting for you to succeed. Classes and workshops give you the chance to soft-launch products and services, as well as build excitement for any new offerings you wish to preview.
However you strategize, make sure you’ve considered in advance how to measure success or failure of your workshop. Ultimately the ROI payoff should justify the class cost! Here are just a few ideas for workshops your business can host during the doldrums of winter (and beyond).
Cooking or baking class
Don’t be afraid to lift the curtain to reveal the ingredients behind Grandma’s secret pie recipe. Any customer loyal enough to come take a class is going to continue to support you by eating at your business. (Plus: who really has the time and energy to replicate Grandma’s recipe to perfection?). Learning what it takes to make your product just so can help a customer appreciate just how special you are.
Sewing repair class
If you’re a local dry cleaner or a clothing retail shop, consider running a quick workshop on how to replace buttons, fix normal wear-and-tear, or darn a sock. This allows your customers to enjoy your products longer, and empowers them to actively care for their belongings. It also shows how much you care for your own offerings.
Tasting class
This type of class is an all-time crowd pleaser! If you sell alcohol, coffee or tea, or even cheese, offer a special class to enhance your customer’s palates. You can suggest different pairings and offer in-class-only discounts to your VIPs to encourage them to expand their purchase set. This is a great way to introduce and promote new products and to become a reliable authority in your community that people will always seek.
Exercise or activity class
Many athletic stores go beyond traditional retail to provide instruction and support for their customers: a yoga class or running group, for example. A great model to mirror is Jackrabbit, a fitness apparel and outdoor adventure brand. In addition to selling great running shoes, they offer running classes to help customers improve technique and stamina. After all, if runners keep running, they are going to need more shoes!
Spa class
This is a great option for treating your VIPs while also doing some covert marketing for your best products! Have your top facialist or massage therapist show techniques for relaxing spa time at home. It’s a perfect way to encourage customers to buy more products for at-home use.
DIY home repair class
Local hardware stores can show customers how to do simple home-repair projects using their tools. Host workshops on how to fix a toilet, repair a leaky faucet, weather-proof a window frame, or build a planter for growing your own tomatoes. Showing people how to use your products is an easy way to make more sales!
No matter what type of business you run, showing off your expertise is a fantastic way to share your passion with your best customers. Let your business shine while also spending some quality time with the people who help you succeed!

news_320,news,Business accelerators: Affordable perks to attract key customer types,"When it comes to personalized service and special perks, small businesses have the edge over the big players. Ramp up your offerings with these quick, low-cost ideas for enticing different customer segments through your doors—and keeping them there.
…",26-02-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-affordable-perks-attract-key-customer-types/,"In the fierce competition with online retailers and chain stores, small businesses wield a powerful advantage—personalized service.
Welcoming environments, one-on-one advice, special deals for regulars—many customers seek out local businesses for the attention and positive experience. Build on that great service with loyalty programs such as Clover Rewards and extra low-cost perks, and customers will be hooked for life.
Whether you own a clothing store, café, vape shop, or day spa, the first step is to understand who your customers are and what they value most. Closely observe the people walking through the door. Gather input from frontline staff and customer data from Clover Insights. Are there particular personalities and demographic segments that your business attracts?
Next, brainstorm some simple, affordable enhancements that specific customer groups will love. Here are a few ideas to get the creative juices rolling.
The Hipster
They’re younger, cooler, and more environmentally conscious, and they’re a growing segment of the market. While just 10 percent of Americans identify as hipsters, 50 percent of 18–29 year olds proudly claim the label.
To attract these customers to your business, consider these ideas: Install bike racks and air pumps for two-wheeled, carbon-free travelers. Stock coconut milk and other vegan ingredients to supplement milk-based products. Update your playlist with hip new tunes compiled by music lovers.
Or, you can step up your game and invest in a giveaway everyone likes: reusable shopping bags, emblazoned with your logo. What else can you think of that might please the younger crowd?
The Harried Parent
When you spot little ones in tow, be assured their parents are probably frazzled. That’s because young children are so easily distracted, irritable, or flat-out uncooperative.
Help parents entertain their kids, and you’ll win their hearts forever. Install a play area in your shop filled with quiet toys that capture attention—a wooden maze or old-fashioned blocks work great. Bookshops and toy stores might host a storytelling hour, inviting a local author or skilled narrator.
Even better, consider a short-term childcare service for top spenders, compliments of your staff. For an hour, parents can drop off their kids and enjoy some hassle-free time to shop, sip, or enjoy a salon experience at your location. Rest assured, they’ll be coming back for more!
The Professional
Professional people clock long hours on the job. Gallup surveys find that adults employed full-time spend 47 hours per week at work, or the equivalent of nearly six work days. And that’s just an average figure—many people put in 50- and 60-hour weeks.
And what do you think time-pressed, overextended people want most? Convenience. Pampering. Someone to take over the little tasks they just can’t get to.
That presents opportunities for connecting and building good will. If you own a clothing store, for example, you might offer garment repair, hemming, and light alterations. Jewelry stores could provide complimentary cleaning. Hair salons could give quick root touch-ups to ease clients through to their next appointments.
Busy people appreciate the care and attention you give to making their lives easier. What are some other services that might help?
The Retiree
Seniors, on the other hand, are often on the opposite end of the time squeeze, with plenty of spare hours on their hands.
What unique characteristic do your older customers share? What habits make them stand out? How can your business tap this market with loyalty perks they’ll love?
For example, retirees in your area might enjoy shopping with their dogs. If so, create a friendly space with free pet treats and water. If you own a plant nursery or florist shop, encourage customers to bring in their ailing plants for free consultations.
And don’t forget senior discounts and early-bird specials—a favorite for anyone on a fixed income.
The Penny Pincher
Whether budgets are tight or they’re just naturally frugal, many working-age people are also cost conscious. Sometimes it’s the only way to make ends meet.
While you don’t want to argue over prices or give up prime dining space to low-ticket spenders who never leave, keep in mind that cost-sensitive customers can be good for business.
Beyond price, these buyers often appreciate quality and expert advice. Consider offering personalized shopping services to steer customers to affordable, well-made work attire that won’t go out of style. You might post “best deals” on your menu or display racks. You could even offer discounted services during slow hours to keep business brisk and customers happy.
Don’t forget the surest way to reward loyal customers who appreciate a break: setting up a Clover Rewards program. This simple, free app helps you create multiple perks to reach more customers, and set up bonuses for regulars and VIPs.
Every business has its own cast of characters that frequent it. But some personality types will be especially drawn to your location, whether because of neighborhood demographics or what the business offers.
Try out free and low-cost perks that cater to particular customers—and attract more of the people you serve.

But now, it’s becoming more and more clear that you can no longer handle all of the day-to-day tasks by yourself. This post details 5 questions you should ask yourself before hiring your first employee.
…",01-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-ask-hiring-first-employee/,"As an owner of your own business, you’re used to working hard. You’ve put in plenty of blood, sweat, and tears as you built it from the ground up. But now, it’s becoming more and more clear that you can no longer handle all of the day-to-day tasks by yourself. It’s time to hire your first employee. A momentous occasion for any business owner, for sure. But with that milestone also comes increased responsibilities (and risks) you should be aware of. For example, one estimate tallies the average cost of recruiting, hiring and training a new employee at close to $4,000. With that in mind, this post will detail 5 questions you should ask yourself before hiring employees.
1. When’s the right time to hire someone?
In short, it’s time to hire someone when you’re consistently putting in more time than is sustainable and still feeling like you’re not getting everything done. Seventy-hour weeks should not be seen as your new normal. Hire too early in your business’s lifecycle and the employee won’t have enough to do. Hire too late and you run the risk of burning yourself out trying to accomplish everything by yourself.
You also need to be sure you can financially sustain that new hire, but we’ll discuss more of the numbers/taxes/legal aspect later in this post.
2. Where’s the best place to find a first employee?
At this point, there’s no need to start at Monster.com. According to the Wall Street Journal, referrals from friends, advisers, and industry colleagues are often the most efficient way to find new employees. By going the networking route, you’ll ensure that candidates have already undergone a certain amount of prescreening. (After all, your colleagues likely wouldn’t recommend them if they hadn’t performed good work for them in the past.)
3. Who’s the best employee to hire?
It might be tempting to go after candidates with higher-profile backgrounds, but they’re probably not the best fit for your environment. Instead, focus on employees who are more in the jack-of-all-trades mold. By hiring someone who has a wide range of skills, you’ll get an employee who is able to pitch in wherever asked. Their inherent flexibility will be an important asset as you offload certain responsibilities.
4. Is your business legally ready to bring on a new employee?
This is one of the tougher questions to answer in the process, but making sure all of your T’s are crossed and I’s are dotted is imperative. This site provides a pretty comprehensive list of all of the legal mandates and operational requirements you need to fulfill prior to bringing on an employee. It includes tasks like getting an Employee Identification Number (EIN), registering with your state’s labor department, setting up workers’ compensation insurance, and preparing your payroll system to withhold taxes.
5. Are there other resources that can make it easier to hire employees?
Absolutely. Clover specializes in new ways to run your business better. They offer several handy apps that can make the process of hiring and managing a lot less work. Consider trying HR Resources by Homebase. It has job descriptions, new hire forms, hiring guides, performance reviews and more. You should also take a look at Gusto Payroll Integration. It’s designed to help you automate a lot of important tasks like tax withholding, reporting, etc.
By answering these questions, you’ll get a successful head start down the path of growing your business with your first employee.

news_324,news,The Power of Habit for small business owners,"As a business owner, you’re probably overworked, which makes it all too easy to fall into bad habits. If you feel like you’re always scrambling to put out fires, harnessing the power of habit can help you remake your work life to be more efficient and less stressful. 
…",06-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/the-power-of-habit-for-small-business-owners/,"Cue, routine, reward. That’s how habits work, and that’s the key insight from Charles Duhigg’s bestselling book The Power of Habit. We get a cue, like that groggy feeling we have when we first wake up, and it prompts us to begin a routine—stumbling into the kitchen to get coffee. The reward that we get when the caffeine hits our system reinforces the habit, ensuring that we’ll repeat it day after day.
Duhigg also teaches us that we can harness the power of this automatic system to break destructive habits and deliberately create new, beneficial habits. If, for example, you wanted to give up caffeine, you’d need to substitute a new routine and reward in the habit loop, like making a delicious decaf beverage or going for an early-morning walk to wake yourself up.
As a business owner, you’re probably overworked and constantly pressed for time, which makes it all too easy to fall into bad habits. If you’re a chronic procrastinator, if you feel like you’re always scrambling to put out fires, if you never have time to relax, harnessing the power of habit can help you remake your work life to be more efficient and less stressful. All you need to do is create some new routines-—and reward yourself for keeping up those good habits.
Here are three ways to put the power of habit to work for you and your business:
1. Prune your to-do list.
Procrastination can be a tricky habit to break, but it can be broken. Start by eliminating any tasks you don’t actually need to do yourself. Hire an accountant to take some time-consuming paperwork off your desk. Can you delegate something like scheduling employees to a manager or another trusted employee? Set that person up with an app like Timeclock that makes scheduling a quick and easy task, so they don’t get behind on their other work. Then automate or streamline anything you can’t delegate. For example, the DAVO Sales Tax app will automatically set aside your sales tax every day and even pay it for you!
2. Create new routines to help you stay on top of your work.
The power of habit can help you find the time to tackle the tasks that always seem to fall to the bottom of your to-do list. For example, if you’d like to make more time to dig into the data and keep track of your business’s performance, routine can help. Choose a simple, centralized app that will show you a lot of information at a glance. Clover Insights can show you how your performance compares to similar businesses in your area, tell you what your most popular products are, and help you better target your advertising by showing you where your customers come from. Create a new routine where you take five minutes to review this data every morning while drinking a cup of coffee. Use the cue (arriving at the office or opening up your computer), routine (check out one or two data points), reward (delicious coffee!) cycle to help you turn this task into a habit.
3. Create a self-care routine.
It’s easy to neglect yourself when you’re overwhelmed, but putting off taking care of yourself will eventually lead to burnout—and that’s no good for you or your business. Add self-care to your to-do list and make it a habit using the cue-routine-reward cycle. For example, a device like a Fitbit that tracks your steps will create an automatic reward for walking more by showing you your progress. But creating good habits doesn’t have to cost money. If you have a daily or weekly meeting that usually involves coffee and pastry, try turning it into a walking meeting so you get outside and get moving. If you usually look at your phone first thing in the morning, try setting a journal right next to your bed, to cue you to take five minutes to think about your goals for the day instead of diving right into the day’s problems. Taking time for yourself, even if it’s just a few minutes a day, can make you happier and more productive—and healthy habits can help.

news_325,news,Enterprise behavior: Strategic planning for SMBs,"Whether you’re a small, medium, or large business, it pays to spend some time, at least once a year, to do strategic planning. Here’s a quick process for walking through strategic planning for small and mid-sized businesses.…",07-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-strategic-planning-smbs/,"Whether you’re a small, medium, or large business, it pays to spend some time, at least once a year, on strategic planning. While you may not need a formal plan, going through the strategic planning process can help you define your competitive advantage—how your business and products uniquely meet the needs of your customers—and meet your business goals. A business strategy, in its simplest terms, is a plan for how you plan to achieve your vision and business objectives. Typically, a complete strategic plan has 3 main components: it identifies where the business stands today—including its strengths and weaknesses, what goals and priorities you want to focus on, and the plan to get there.
How Is the Business Performing Right Now?
Many business planning sessions begin with a simple SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats and is a good measure of how the business is currently performing. Make a chart with these four headings and brainstorm all the factors influencing your business right now.

Strengths make your business strong and can be anything from the location of your business to your killer pesto lasagna recipe.
Weaknesses include anything that is currently hurting your business, like limited capital to advertise or slow order processing.
Opportunities are things coming up in the near future that you believe will positively influence your business, such as an event or a potential partnership.
Threats will negatively affect the viability of your business. They often stem from the competition, but can also include things such as pending legislation, a bus stop moving locations, or nearby construction.

Once you have these four categories mapped out, prioritize the most pressing concerns you believe will be important to meeting your goals in the coming year. These are the things that need to be addressed in your strategic plan.
How Do You Compete With Other Businesses?
This question digs a little deeper into the Threats category. Even if you’re not attempting to grow your business, you want to make sure it will be viable going forward which means keeping an eye on the competition.
Start by doing basic research on who your competitors are. Do a few searches online about your products and services, look at local news reports, and check in with your local chamber of commerce. Ask customers where they shop and your suppliers about other businesses in your area. Are there new businesses that might compete with yours? Are there other businesses that would interfere with your ability to continue working in your area? For example, if you’re running a child daycare facility, are there changes in the neighborhood that make it less child-friendly?
For a deeper dive into competitors, take a look at research tools. Clover Insights, the free analytics app by Clover, can give you great insight into local competitors as well as similar businesses in other cities. You can easily look at how similar businesses are performing and what kinds of customers they bring in. Sometimes your biggest competitor comes from outside your industry, so make sure to research where your customers are also shopping—not just businesses by industry or type.
What Are Your Goals?
Once you have a good sense of where your company stands, consider where you want it to go. Are you looking to grow the company, or better serve your customers? Do you need to improve efficiencies, or perhaps devote less time to unrewarding tasks? Make a list of your goals for this year. (Check out this blog on setting business goals to help you get started.) Make sure to include financial goals.
The Plan
After thinking through all the factors above, the next step is to prioritize what actions you’ll take this year to reach your most important goals. With your budget and financial situation in mind, consider the following questions:

How much money do I need to make to reach my goals? Even if you are not planning on growing your business, you’ll need to at least break even. The break-even point is how much you need to sell to make back your investment in the business. To calculate this, add up all your operational costs, then divide that by the profit you make on each sale. This will give you a sense of how much you need to sell to stay in business.
What kind of promotions or activities do I need to do to reach my goals? Your business goals determine what types of promotions will work best for you. For example, if the main purpose of your business is to educate consumers, promotions geared toward growing your email list would work better than throwing an annual sale which is geared toward increasing revenue. Consider your goals and create a list of possible promotions. (Need ideas? Check out this post with 13 promotion ideas for the most common business goals.)
When is the best time to conduct these activities? Take a look at upcoming events such as holidays, conferences, and seasons and map out a draft calendar of when each promotion or activity should be run. Then think about your resources—your available staff, money, and time—and whether the schedule makes sense or whether you need to make adjustments.
How much money do I need to invest to reach these goals? Not having enough capital can derail the best of plans. Sometimes moving your promotions to a different time of year when cashflow is better is the answer, and sometimes you’ll need a little extra help. Bank loans are not the only option for funding. Clover Capital can help you tap into future credit card purchases to fund your business now.
How will I measure success? Periodically, during the year, you’ll want to check in on your progress and determine whether you’re on track to meet your goals. Take a minute to work out how you’ll measure success and put reminders in your calendar to check your progress.

One of the advantages of being a small or mid-sized business is the ability to nimbly respond to changes in the marketplace without having to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and formal planning. That said, going through the above process, even informally, will help you reach your business goals. With Clover in your corner, strategic planning is a little easier.

news_326,news,"Business accelerators: Perfect your sales pitch, part 1","Does your sales pitch close the sale? Does it convert customers into evangelists? It should! Here are 5 easy steps to perfect your sales pitch. What works today might not be that compelling tomorrow, so experiment with your sales pitch using tips from Clover.…",08-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-perfect-sales-pitch-part-1/,"Why should customers buy from you? What makes your business different from everyone else? Whether you’re just starting out or upping your game you need to be able to articulate what sets your business apart. This is known in marketing as your value proposition, or in sales as the unique selling proposition—the one unique quality about your business that makes it more attractive to customers than your competition. Your value proposition becomes a fundamental part of your elevator speech, your marketing, and your approach to selling and interacting with customers. If you are pitching your business to investors or banks it’s one of the things you need to have very clear in your business plan because it defines who you are as a business and how you will compete in the marketplace.
Perfecting your sales pitch can also help you clarify what your business is all about—who you are and who you are not. It will help you identify exactly who your market is and what their unique needs are. Knowing this will help you identify products, services you should consider as well as which promotions are likely to work best.
The best sales pitches accomplish four things. They:

Explain what you do or what you sell.
Resonate with customers.
Set you apart from the competition.
Bring you one step closer to your goal.

If you’re an existing business, check out the “Reviews” function of Clover Online listings, which makes it easy to keep up with what customers posting on over 20 review sites. Looking at reviews gives you insight into why your business resonates with customers and why they bought from you in the past. It can also give you an objective perspective of how your customers view your business in the marketplace. You can also poll customers directly using Clover’s Feedback app before they post reviews publicly.
If you’re starting from scratch, try this process to come up with sales pitch ideas.

List out the most important things you want prospective customers to know about you. Are you completely committed to environmentally friendly products? Do you support the local economy? Do you do things the old-fashioned way? Do you have a money-back guarantee, or a unique process for customizing your products? List out as many ideas as you can—you will narrow them down over time.
Identify your niche market. Who is most likely to be interested in the items you listed above? What language do they use to describe their needs or concerns? Where do they communicate—on social media or at live events? How will you reach this market? The more you think about who your market is, the better your pitch will resonate with them.
List your main competitors and for each one list out why your target market will buy from you instead.
Test, test, test. The next time you have a conversation with a customer, test out your value proposition and really listen to their responses. Do they seem interested? Does it compel them to buy? Do they sign up for your email list or loyalty points? Test it out on social media—what gets the most likes and shares? Look at reviews of your business—what positive things do customers note? What messaging did they not understand? By testing you’ll be able to distill what messaging resonates with your most loyal, buying customers.
Customize this pitch for every occasion. Now that you’ve identified what makes you unique and who your target market is, it’s time to practice a few scenarios where you’ll need to use your sales pitch. Come up with sales pitch ideas that you might use in the following situations:


Imagine yourself at a party meeting someone new. How would you explain your business in 2-3 sentences? Try to come up with one or two open-ended questions you can ask that will intrigue them into considering you for future business.
Picture trying to sell your best-selling product to a new customer in your store. How would you describe it in a way that will make the person want to buy from you instead of a competitor? What expert tips or extra service can you offer that will make them want to buy from you again? How does knowing your pitch change the way you sell?
Now try picturing yourself selling a new product to a new customer. Explain why this new product fits in with your business and what makes you unique.
Imagine yourself on Shark Tank. You’re in a room of investors and you want to intrigue them into helping you take your business to the next level. What’s your pitch? Come up with a few sound bites that really articulate your value proposition.
You’re coming up with new marketing materials and need a tagline—one sentence that sums up who you are and what you represent. What would it be?

Don’t be afraid to experiment. Just like fashion—what’s relevant and compelling to customers today may not work tomorrow. Try new things and always be perfecting your sales pitch.

news_328,news,5 questions to ask when picking a credit card processor,"Read about credit card processing for your business. Clover shares card processor tips on payment methods, possible fees, and security.…",15-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-when-picking-a-credit-card-processor/,"Picking a credit card processor should be relatively straightforward, right? Actually, all the options on the market can be a little overwhelming. Each processor comes with various bells and whistles, and it’s these little details that make a big difference. How do you know which bells and whistles are right for your business?
Take a deep breath and imagine all the new transactions you’ll be able to accomplish with your new processor. Start with these five questions to find the right credit card processor and get back to doing business.
1. Where is your business now…and where is it going?
Think about the roadmap you have for your company. If you’re a new merchant, consider your credit card processor in relation to your overall POS system: that is, do you need a full inventory, register, and accounting solution, or just a simple card reader? Are you looking for an upgrade to EMV, or are you looking for something you can customize to accept gift cards, EMV, and more? How easy is it to accept any form of payment—even the ones that haven’t been invented yet?
If you’re a well-established business looking to grow, think about things like security, customer service, and integrating with your existing technology when selecting a card processor. The goal is to find a way to make your business run efficiently—while not going over budget.
2. How much are you willing to spend?
Speaking of budget…costs are probably at the top of your list when considering a new card processor. In addition to the initial price tag, there are other fees that come from accepting payments over time.
Interchange fees are charged for every transaction you process, and usually range from 2% to 3% per transaction. The devil is in the details when it comes from interchange fees: the rate is determined depends on several factors, including the type of card accepted, the type of transaction, and the size of the transaction.
In addition to the interchange fees, be on the lookout for monthly statement fees, application and setup fees, monthly minimum fees, monthly gateway access fees, and early termination fees. All these fees can add up quickly! Generally, however, these total fees shouldn’t cost more than $200 annually for brick-and mortar-merchants—and no more than $300 annually for ecommerce retailers.
3. How do customers purchase from your business?
The way your business is set up can have implications for the credit card processor that’s best for your company. According to one study by Google, 76% of people who search on their smartphones for something nearby visit the business within
24 hours: 28% of those searches result in a purchase. Being able to accept credit cards whenever, wherever, is mission critical to capture this business.
Likewise, if you’re an omnichannel retailer selling online and in-store, you might consider a card processing solution that gives you more flexibility. A word of warning: some processors have proprietary software that may not work with your online shopping cart. Most processors work with a company called Authorize.Net, a fairly universal software (and probably a good bet).
4. What are your biggest struggles?
Specifically, how can your card processor alleviate some of your pain points? A card processor should be able to streamline your payments process, offer great customer service, and keep your financials well organized. Many payment processors can be customized with software that the merchant needs, instead of a one-size-fits-all version that might create additional work for time-crunched business owners. Explore how your payment processor can give you time back and power up your profits.
5. Is the processor secure?
Credit card processors are supposed to solve problems, not create them. Small businesses across America are under attack from hackers and fraudsters at alarming rates. Make sure your card processor has the proper security standards and compliance in place. Namely, the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, the three-digit Card Verification Value (CVV), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) are what you should be looking for to make sure you’re secure.
Finding the right card processor is not merely about being able to accept credit cards at your store. The right partner can help you bring your business to the next level. Automating time-consuming tasks, centralizing of transaction data, and customizing your payments platform for your needs can give your business the spark it needs to take off!

news_329,news,Design for better business: The art & science of menu design,"A restaurant’s menu should get its customers salivating. But that isn’t going to happen if your menu consists solely of a utilitarian list of dishes. Read more various menu engineering tactics that will optimize your business results.
…",19-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/design-for-better-business-the-art-science-of-menu-design/,"Your restaurant’s food and drink menu should get customers salivating.
But it should do more than simply present a utilitarian list of dishes. Daily specials and wait staff recommendations can only influence customers so much. But a well-designed menu can subtly steer diners to more profitable options.
Implement some of these restaurant menu design tactics to optimize your business results.
It’s a material world
Restaurant customers mainly use the senses of taste and smell to take in information about your eatery, but they also rely on touch as well. From the moment a menu is placed in a diner’s hands, the material it’s printed on conveys a message. High-end restaurants use fabric, leather, or thick paper to communicate that their dishes are of high quality (and worth the money they cost). A quick-serve restaurant may use vinyl or thin card stock to say that menu options represent a good deal.
Once you decide on a material to use for your menu, utilize Clover Online’s Pro Plan to import a menu template or build one from scratch using the platform’s customizable menu feature.

Tap into emotions
People subconsciously respond to color in emotional ways. Red and blue can help trigger appetites, so consider using one or both on your menus if they fit the décor and vibe of your eatery. Bright shades of these colors communicate a sense of Americana and patriotism, so they’re perfect to use at BBQ and other restaurants serving American food. Blue is particularly appropriate for seafood restaurants to use since it makes one think of the ocean, while red is a natural fit for Italian cucinas and pizza places.
People associate the color green with healthy options, so it’s a great option if you own a grab-and-go salad joint or juice bar.
Bright colors, however, may be difficult to use on menus at fine dining establishments. If your restaurant offers a sophisticated dining experience, consider printing your menu in a neutral color, like brown, black, or even white.
Choices, choices, choices
Or not. It may sound counterintuitive to today’s culture that emphasizes customization, but giving diners a limited number of choices is good for business. Restaurant owners should keep in mind “the paradox of choice” when designing their menu. It states that the more options consumers have, the more anxiety they feel. Seven dishes in each section of your menu (appetizers, main dishes, desserts) give diners options without overwhelming them.
click or tap the image for source

It’s all in the layout
How you describe your dishes is important. (More on that later.) But customers rarely, if ever, read a menu word for word. Eatery owners should be deliberate in the presentation of dishes on their menu —whether using individual cards or a menu board behind the counter — to encourage customers to take the most profitable path when ordering.
Diners’ gaze naturally goes to the center of a menu before traveling to the upper right corner and then to the upper left corner. Menu engineers encourage restaurateurs to place items with the highest profit margins in this “Golden Triangle” area. Highlight these dishes: Refer to them as a “Chef’s special,” place a box around them or include a photo or drawing of the food. One study found that showcasing images on a digital menu board prompted customers to order more salads. The Menu Boards app integrates directly with Clover POS systems and easily enables merchants to create a digital menu — no tech or graphic design experience necessary.
click or tap the image for source
The Golden Triangle isn’t the only area to area to feature cost-effective dishes. Customers subconsciously prefer the first two and the last item in each menu section. Design yours so that it features dishes in these slots that are friendlier to your bottom dollar.
If you have one item that’s significantly more expensive than anything else on your menu, feature it near the top or even in the Golden Triangle area. Diners will look at it first, then move on and think that everything else on the menu is reasonably priced.
Looks matter
It’s not enough to use a smart design or the right colors on your menu. Successful eatery owners have menus featuring stylish graphic embellishments as well. Experts refer to these decorative graphics, frames, and even typography as “eye magnets.” The clever elements draw diners’ eyes to particular menu items and help them navigate the menu in a way that’s advantageous to your profits. For instance, dotted lines can lead customers from appetizer to entrée to dessert sections. Or, a colored box or small illustration placed to the side can make a dish stand out on a simple menu design.
The power of words
The words that you use can entice diners to splurge. Detailed write-ups that utilize descriptive adjectives to communicate specifics about a dish make a customer “taste” the food before it arrives at their table. Appetizing descriptions also make diners feel like they’re getting more bang for their buck.
Instead of saying what type of chocolate is used in your brownies, state where it’s sourced from. Same goes for the fancy coffee beans that you use to make your house brew. If the bread used to make your sandwiches is made locally or is organic, make note of those facts.
click for source: design by Passport Design Bureau

Don’t forget pricing
Reducing the cost of a meal isn’t the only thing you can do to make food appear more alluring. Savvy restaurateurs banish the dollar sign and the word “dollars” from their menus. Their inclusion reminds diners of the pain of spending money. Plus, a 2009 study found that customers spend more at restaurants with menus that excluded both the symbol and the word.
You can also make prices less conspicuous by printing them immediately following a dish’s description. List them in a neat column will lead customers to focus solely on the numbers, instead of the dish itself.

news_330,news,Spring GIFs for small businesses,"It may not feel like it, but spring is right around the corner! We have a list of 6 spring GIFs to brighten your day and help you hit the refresh button this season. …",20-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/spring-gifs-for-small-businesses/,"Okay, so maybe this year Phil the Groundhog predicted six more weeks of winter (thanks, Phil!). But with Daylight Savings Time under our belts, spring feels closer than ever! And what better way to celebrate than with a spring refresh? Dig yourself out of the snow, rouse your employees from their winter hibernation, and use these spring GIFs to help you celebrate the season in style. Here are some fresh takes on what’s to come for Clover businesses this spring!
1. Get ready to OWN tax season.
via Giphy
Taxes are often the most painful part of anyone’s year, especially if you’re a small business owner. The new tax reforms make filing your taxes just a little more complicated. Give yourself a little extra motivation this year to get your return done on time. Make a motivational playlist, reward yourself with a sweet treat, or take a half-day Friday. You got this!
2. Look for a clever way to celebrate.
via Giphy
April Fool’s Day is always a crowd favorite, but besides Easter, there aren’t many “big” holidays on the calendar until the end of May. Take the opportunity to celebrate a lesser-known day! National Grilled Cheese Sandwich Day is April 12, or Arbor Day is on April 12. Do you read our monthly promo calendar posts? There’s plenty of inspiration to get you through the month!
3. Countdown the month with March Madness.
via Giphy
Need a reason to get fired up? March Madness is here, and you can play along with your customers to help increase sales. If you run a restaurant or cafe, offer customers a free dessert if they hold winning brackets by the Elite Eight round. Retailers can offer special discounts when your local team (or favorite team) wins a game. Some businesses create their own brackets of products or services to try to shift deadstock or promote new offerings. It’s a win-win for you and your customers.
4. Shower your staff with appreciation.
via Giphy
The cold, dark days of December are well in your rearview mirror, so take the time to thank your staff for their hard work! Good weather puts everyone in a good mood, so spread the love.
5. Do some spring cleaning.
via Giphy
Tis the season to refresh your business! This is a great opportunity to show off new products, try a new menu item, or launch a service you’ve been working on for the last few months. Remind customers that now is the time to try clean out their closets and play up the theme of refreshing your life for the spring in your marketing campaigns!
6. Get involved!
via Giphy
Politics aside, spring is the time to get involved in giving back to your local community. Participate in a town hall meeting, host a food drive, or spend some time cleaning up debris from the winter storms. Playing a positive role in improving the neighborhood will not go unnoticed by your neighbors—more than ever, businesses that give back are winning customers and increasing lifetime loyalty tenfold.

news_331,news,Friends & family investors: How to keep things professional,"Whether you’re scrambling to buy a new industrial refrigerator, expand into a second location, or weather a slowdown, locating funds can be complicated. Weigh the pros and cons of bank loans, alternative lenders, and the most popular option of all—friends and family. 
…",22-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/friends-family-investors-how-to-keep-things-professional/,"Running a small business can be nerve wracking—particularly when the stress point involves money,. Whether you’re scrambling to buy big-ticket items, expand into a second location, or weather a slowdown, cash is critical. But how do you quickly secure funds?
Some business owners turn to friends and family as a funding source, but you should tread carefully if you exercise this option.
First, weigh your financing options

While your first impulse might be a bank, the big ones are notoriously stingy with small businesses. Only 25 percent of loan applications were approved in 2017. That’s more than double the number given out during the recession, but still represents slim odds.
Community banks are more willing to help local businesses. Nearly 50 percent of applications from small businesses are approved, while credit unions approve 40 percent of loan requests. All of these banking options have good repayment terms, but the application process is slow, cumbersome, and often not worth the time if your credit score has been dinged.
Alternative lending sources are much easier to apply for, but watch out for high interest rates. Online options such as Lending Club give you quick quotes, or you can submit an application to an entire network of lenders through services such as Fundera. Carefully compare offers before making a commitment.
For Clover merchants, a safe, easy way to get a cash advance is through Clover Capital. You can borrow up to 100 percent of your monthly average credit card sales. Repayment is totally automated. Clover simply withholds a small portion of your credit card sales each day—no hassles for you.
Consider friends and family

Don’t forget about the most popular funding avenue, which is friends and family. In the startup arena, Fundable reports that 38 percent of founders raise money from their friends and family—collecting over $60 billion per year in total.
This time-honored way to launch entrepreneurial dreams is also great for financing business projects. Expanding your restaurant’s capacity, opening a second store, creating a new menu by a hot new chef, rolling out a marketing blitz—all these prospects require commitment, an element of risk, and an infusion of money.
Many merchants tap their trusted circle to help grow the business. With an appealing elevator speech and a solid plan explaining what you want to accomplish, you can eliminate the red tape of banks, while getting the best repayment terms.
But all good things come with caveats. Your friends and family like you, so they’re willing to invest in the business. If anything goes wrong—your project doesn’t pan out financially or you fall behind on payments—the relationship can sour.
Keep it professional

No one wants strained ties with the people they care about. That’s why it’s smart to clearly set the terms of the deal. Beyond a handshake and verbal confirmation, prepare a simple document that states exactly what you’ve agreed to, including the loan amount and repayment plan.
With friends and family loans, you have some flexibility in structuring payments. While a fixed schedule is the most clear-cut option, you might also offer a share in the business or tie re-payments to revenue growth.
Sharing your success with others can bring a welcome dose of support, especially if the investors have business expertise and are willing to advise you. On the flip side, the mentorship can quickly become a nuisance if the investors are ill-informed or meddlesome.
Think hard about the potential upsides and downsides of sharing profits with friends and family. Also, weigh the impact on your relationship if you fall behind on a loan. There’s no one solution for everyone, but if you clearly consider the pros and cons, you’re more likely to pick the best one for you.
Lastly, consider having an intermediary handle the repayment process. The US Small Business Administration suggests using a peer-to-peer lending company. You and your lender decide on the repayment terms, and the outside company manages the transaction for a fee.
Everyone needs funds to keep the business moving forward. While locating that money can take some thought and effort, it’s not as hard as it might seem. Find the right option, and kickstart the next stage of your business journey.

news_332,news,Growing pains: Why you should add a middle manager to your team,"Small business owners roll up their sleeves as clerks, shift managers, bookkeepers, servers, cashiers, and payroll managers, to name a few. But as their business grows, adding a middle manager can provide the support they need in order to focus on big-picture goals.…",26-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-adding-a-middle-manager-to-your-team/,"Small business owners are often involved in many–and sometimes all–aspects of running their businesses day-to-day.
They roll up their sleeves as clerks, shift managers, bookkeepers, servers, cashiers, and payroll managers, to name just a few roles. But managing everything often leaves them exhausted and without the time to devote to certain areas of their business that are in need.
As a business grows—whether in foot traffic or scaling to an additional location—adding staff becomes essential. A middle manager can provide essential support, freeing owners up to focus less on the day-to-day minutiae and more on big-picture goals.
The addition of tiers to a management structure is a good problem to have, but middle management can introduce some complicated issues. Navigate past them successfully and the new manager—and the business—will flourish.
Recognizing the need
How do you know if it’s really time to hire a middle manager?
That’s a difficult question for many small business owners to answer. It’s routine for entrepreneurs to put in long hours, working across all areas of the business. And society has never really emphasized the importance of middle managers. At large corporations, the role is has traditionally been thankless and invisible, with the Boston Consulting Group referring to it as a “neglected but critical group.” Pop culture has largely depicted workers in these positions as being micro-managers who have little to no power.
In reality, however, middle managers are to small business owners as Alexander Hamilton was to George Washington—they’re the necessary right-hand person.
If you’re already using various Clover apps to make your work life easier but still feel overwhelmed, you probably need to delegate more. Jot down a list of your daily tasks and see which ones you could pass off to someone else. A middle manager should take enough responsibilities off your plate to free up time in your schedule for strategic thinking and high-priority to-dos.
It’s also wise to consider hiring a manager if you have multiple locations, or if you’re thinking of expanding your business. It’s impossible to be in two places at the same time or work 24/7. When a manager is on location, employees feel more confident and perform at a higher level. And you’ll gain peace of mind knowing someone is in charge and on hand in case something goes wrong.
Making valuable contributions
Middle managers can help you turn your strategic plans into action by making decisions about resource allocations, store design, and customer service. For instance, delegate employee scheduling to a trusted middle manager at your pizzeria. She can use the Time Clock app to create a more efficient schedule—one that reduces the number of servers working at a time but still allows them to provide high-quality customer service—and to divvy up tips at the end of a shift.
Beyond scheduling, middle managers can be a valued mediator between you and your employees. Say your baristas are having problems with a new drink offering. A middle manager will likely have first-hand knowledge of the issue since they also spend time behind the counter. But she’ll also know your strategic reasons for putting the new item on the menu. In this position, managers can internalize feedback from both sides, then offer possible solutions that are pleasing to both you and your employees.
Middle managers are also essential in building employee engagement. In a recent survey by software company TINYpulse, 70 percent of employees report that their direct managers have implemented an employee engagement strategy. The same survey reveals that of the remaining 30 percent of employees, the majority are more comfortable with a middle manager handling employee engagement over an executive or someone in human resources.
They’re also essential in reducing employee attrition. Middle managers take pride in their work and are loyal to their colleagues. These behaviors have a positive impact on employees, making it less likely they’ll bolt for another job—even a position that pays more than their current one.
Hiring managers can also be a great way to make up for your own shortcomings. Perhaps you don’t have a good sense of aesthetics. Window displays, menu design, store layout, or even product placement may not be your strong suit. Add a manager that excels at these tasks. Then make it part of his job responsibilities to teach you (and your entire staff), so that everyone gains from his unique skill set.

news_334,news,Is equity crowdfunding right for your small business?,"Need an infusion of cash for the business? Crowdfunding is a popular alternative funding method that allows small businesses to raise equity through investors, neighbors, customers, friends and family via an online platform. Find out if crowdfunding is right for you.
…",28-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/is-equity-crowdfunding-right-for-your-small-business/,"Need some extra capital for your business? With the rise of crowdfunding sites such as MicroVenture’s First Democracy VC, Fundable, Kickstarter and more, crowdfunding is a growing source of funding for small- to midsize-businesses. In fact, according to Fundly, crowdfunding has raised more than $34 billion globally. Crowdfunding allows small businesses to raise equity through investors, neighbors, customers, friends and family via an online platform. Merchants can build a case for their business online and potential investors invest right on the site. In exchange, crowdfunding sites charge a percentage of the money raised—usually between 5 and 13 percent—or a service fee.
There are four types of crowdfunding models popular right now:

Equity. In this model, accredited investors become part-owners of the company by purchasing equity shares. Contributors are expected to receive a financial return and a portion of the profits either as a dividend or distribution.
Donations. This is a flip of the equity model—contributors receive no financial return for investing. They are donating their money because they believe in what your business stands for. These crowdfunding campaigns are popular for charities and nonprofits, and are reported to be the second most-popular type of crowdfunding.
Rewards. Reward-based crowdfunding is more of a hybrid. Investors receive a reward, usually in the form of a free product or service, but they don’t receive a portion of the company or profits. In this model, anyone can invest in your business. For small businesses, this can be a great way to test a new product or new market. Examples of rewards might be discounts on services, free drinks with the purchase of a meal for a limited time, or a free consultation.
Debt. Also known as micro-lending, this type of crowdfunding is more like a traditional loan. Contributors will receive their money back over a payment period with interest. This type of crowdfunding is estimated to represent the largest form of crowdfunding, bringing in about $25 billion in peer-to-peer lending globally.

Crowdfunding offers many benefits including:

A wider pool of investors than traditional banks. By putting your business on a platform site you’ll get exposure to a wide assortment of accredited investors, not just your local bank, with no additional effort on your part.
A depersonalized way to ask your personal network for funds. It can be awkward to approach family and friends for money. Creating a site allows them to read through your plans without feeling pressured, and choose to invest or follow your campaign. Even people who are not interested in investing may become a customer or support your business in another way.
More visibility for your business. This applies both to investors and potential new customers. Crowdfunding sites are another platform for spreading the news about your business and what makes you unique.
A more flexible way to apply for funding. While crowdfunding still requires that you adequately describe your business and its prospects, it allows for less traditional (and potentially more compelling) submissions such as videos.
The viral factor. At some point, as your campaign builds interest, it can reach a tipping point where excitement generates more even more attention and funding. In addition, investors are personally invested in your success, which can lead to a network of loyal advocates.
Crowdsourced ideas. By presenting your business to a large pool of potential investors, you’ll also likely get a number of ideas on how to refine your business plan and make it more financially secure.

Wildly successful crowdfunding campaigns often get media attention and it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement. Before you sign up, though, consider some of the potential drawbacks if you decide to give equity crowdfunding a shot:

Sharing a portion of the profit. Per the terms of your funding you’ll owe either a dividend or a distribution—which are a portion of your profits.
Partners. Sometimes partners bring additional expertise and access to a better network…but they also bring the risk of conflict, and to some extent, a loss of control over a portion of your business.
Regulations are in flux. As a new form of financing, crowdfunding rules are bound to change.

If you think crowdfunding might be a good fit for your business, make sure your business is ready for the exposure. Investors will want to know you’re on top of your game and have a plan for making your vision work. Depending on which type of crowdfunding campaign you choose, you may need to present a formal business plan. Even if you don’t, going through some basic strategic planning will help make your campaign more persuasive.
Before starting a campaign, you may also want to take some time to build and organize your contacts and to develop a compelling story. While crowdfunding sites help get you in front of potential investors, odds are most of the initial money will come from people within your network. Make sure you have a plan for advertising your crowdfunding campaign through social media, email, and word-of-mouth to your entire network including customers, other local businesses. (Check out this post for tips on social media marketing for small businesses.)
Also review other alternatives to crowdfunding and traditional bank loans. Clover Capital, for example, is a program that allows small businesses to borrow against future credit card sales.

The best new and updated apps from the Clover App Market are here! From helping your business save the planet to keeping the lunch rush under control, these apps will brighten even your cloudiest of Mondays. We’re featuring the highest rated apps for keeping track of your cash, cutting down on your paper waste, and making it easier to seat customers at a busy restaurant. Read on for fresh business apps you need!
Better Go Green
March means Saint Patrick’s Day, the greenest of holidays. One way to celebrate? Cut down on paper waste with Better Go Green. This handy app allows your customers to go paperless by generating codes on each receipt that give users a website to visit and select a paperless option in the future. Customers can opt to receive receipts via email—a better method for tracking sales and accounting for both you and your clients. Plus, capturing their email address gives you a powerful marketing tool and easy way to stay in touch. Save money on your administrative costs, and save the planet. It’s estimated that 9.6 million trees are cut down each year to produce receipt paper. Your customers (and the polar bears) will thank you.
SeatOn
Does it ever feel like you’re watching a game of musical chairs while trying to seat everyone at your restaurant? If it feels like a scramble to get everyone seated for lunch, you need SeatOn. This app manages reservations, waitlists, and analyzes data about your restaurant’s performance to keep traffic moving smoothly. The powerful features of SeatOn give you a clear picture of your table management, customer relationships, and analytics, including spending trends, occupancy rates, and more. SeatOn interfaces with Clover to manage seating times and reservations, with the added bonus of giving walk-ins more accurate wait-time estimates. The customer relationship management tool remembers customer seating preferences, food allergies, and birthdays or anniversaries, so you can surprise and delight your regulars. Plus, cut down on no-shows by restricting reservation privileges to those who frequently fail to turn up.
Payouts
Liquor stores and bar owners are going to love this app. Payouts helps you figure out where your cash is going—and why. In the course of a busy day, there are a slew of reasons why you might need to remove money from the cash drawer. This app helps you sort out why cash was paid out and make sure your analytics reflect every cash transaction. Payouts works by sorting cash transactions into a variety of categories: lottery payouts, bottle deposit return, keg/tap deposits, and payouts for donations, supplies, vendors or cash drops.
Give your Clover POS system a boost with these apps (and others in the Clover App Market) and see how far your business can grow!

news_336,news,Growing pains: How to adjust salaries as your profits grow,"Starting a business can involve a lot of sacrifice, including living off your savings until the business breaks even. But once your business is consistently making a profit, it may be time to pay yourself a set salary. 
…",31-03-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-how-to-adjust-salaries-as-your-profits-grow/,"Starting a business can involve a lot of sacrifice, including living off your savings until the business breaks even. Vendors have to be paid, and you can’t expect employees to work for free. But once your business has become a little more established, and you’re consistently making a profit, it may be time to pay yourself a set salary, for the sake of your personal budget and for the business’s budget, too.
But how do you know when it’s time to set a salary for yourself? How do you know how much that salary should be? And when do you give yourself a raise? Here are 5 questions that will help you determine how much to pay yourself as your profits grow:
1. How much do you need to make?
Take a close look at your personal expenses. Think about what’s really sustainable. How long can you really live on ramen? Will you burn out if you don’t budget in money for a vacation at least once a year? (Hint: The answer is probably yes.)
2. How much could you make at another company?
If your business is structured as a corporation, the IRS requires you to make “reasonable compensation” for your work. That means underpaying yourself could be a costly mistake. Check out online tools like Payscale, or ask around—an accountant or a recruiter, for example, might have a good sense of what the going rate is for someone with your skills in your area.
3. How long have you been in the black?
If your business just started breaking even last month, you might want to wait a little while longer before you determine your salary. Ideally, you should wait until you’ve been profitable for a year—that way you can be reasonably confident that you can make a plan and stick to it.
4. How stable are your profits?
If you’re in a cyclical, seasonal, or otherwise variable business, you’ll want to take that into account. Don’t set a salary based on your best quarter. Depending on how your business is structured, you may be able to give yourself a lower base salary (as long as it’s “reasonable”) and then take bonuses each quarter based on the business’s profits. Talk to your accountant to make sure the system you’re considering works with the IRS requirements for your business.
5. How much do you hope to grow in the next couple of years?
Growth can be expensive—if you’re hoping to expand in the near future, think about the additional expenses involved. Will you need to hire more staff, rent a new location, or pay for more raw materials? Will you need more help from lawyers, accountants, or other professionals? Factor those expenses in when you’re figuring out how much you can afford to pay yourself.
Once you’ve determined how much to pay yourself, experts recommend checking back in every six months or so to make sure that this system is working, both for you and for the business. If your profits have continued to grow, you could consider giving yourself a raise based on your annual growth rate—if your business has grown 10%, you get a 10% raise—or simply running through these questions again to see where you fall. Whatever salary you come up with, using a tool like Gusto Payroll to automate payroll, deductions, and benefits can make things a lot easier—and provide an automatic record of what you’ve been paid when tax time comes.

news_338,news,Enterprise behavior: 5 trends to watch in retail for 2018,"In top trends for 2018, small stores are hot. While big-box retailers are trying to squeeze into scaled-down, friendlier formats, they rarely fit. Find out how small business owners can fight back and dominate the space. …",03-04-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-5-trends-to-watch-in-retail-for-2018/,"Learn even more! Watch our on-demand webinar, “How Brick-And-Mortar Retailers Can Compete in the Digital Age,” to find out how your business can capture nearby consumers who are searching for products you offer.


There’s some great news if you operate in the retail space.
In top trends to watch for 2018, small stores are hot. Massive brick and mortars such as Nordstrom and Target are experimenting with smaller outlets, while digital giants like Amazon are moving into physical locations.
That might seem like more competition for small businesses, but the big players are scrambling. While monster stores can try to squeeze themselves into scaled-down formats that customers prefer, they rarely fit.
For authenticity, local knowledge, and genuine caring, small businesses win hands down. Research from First Data, Clover’s parent company, supports these and other projections, with a forecast for sunny days ahead.
1. Smaller is better.

You already know this from firsthand experience, but the chains are finally waking up to an unsettling fact. People are losing interest in anonymous big-box shopping, particularly when buying online is easier.
First Data finds that an increasingly urbanized population wants something more personal and enjoyable. Rather than being stuck in their cubicles and apartments, they want to go out and experience life.
That includes shopping at local businesses that know them, offer merchandise they like, and add-on services they care about, such as exchanges, recommendations, and even events that bring the community together.
Check out these indie bookstore programs that are driving foot traffic and fueling the sector’s comeback.
2. Same-day delivery is on the rise.

Customers expect convenience, which is why so many people order online. But brick and mortars can outperform online competitors in a key area: same-day delivery.
From Macy’s to Walmart to Office Depot, large stores are jumping on board. The experts at First Data found that the number of stores offering same-day delivery rose dramatically in the past year—from 16 percent in 2016 to a whopping 51 percent in 2017.
Small businesses can easily match the big players, while better managing the process. Clover apps such as Better Delivery and Delivery Fee help you seamlessly accept, fill, and deliver orders to your customers.
Better Delivery targets efficiency—a big problem when you have drivers on the road and little communication between runs. When orders come in, Clover POS software locates the nearest driver, sends the order through a mobile app designed for phones, and directs the driver to the shortest route. The app saves employees fuel and frustration, while cutting delivery time for customers.
Better Delivery also lets customers and staff track orders in real time. The app links driver data to the company website so everyone can see where on a map the driver is located and when the order is expected to arrive.
With the inexpensive Delivery Fee, a pop-up appears with each order that asks employees to add or waive a delivery fee. The app helps capture extra fees that often get lost in the ordering process.
3. The gig economy is coming to more stores.

Physical retailers are now linking up with quick, inexpensive on-demand services. First Data noted this trend in new partnerships:

Ikea acquired TaskRabbit to expand its assembly and installation offerings.
Amazon launched Amazon Home Services, a marketplace of service providers.
Lowe’s partnered with Porch to bump up access to home improvement professionals and advice.

These massive websites of freelance help can be great. But they can also be a crapshoot, with shoddy work and no-shows damaging the customer experience.
Again, small businesses have the edge. You know your business and your customers. You know what steps they should take or who to recommend to get the job done right. You’re reliable and proven.
Most customers want experts they can count on, not websites full of random people. Capitalize on your reputation—and beat the big guys every time.
4. Subscription services are back.

There’s nothing new about subscription services. If you’re old enough, you probably remember mail-order music clubs like Columbia House or Book of the Month club.
What‘s new, however, is the resurgence of interest in the concept. Research from First Data tracks the rise of buzzy startups such as Birchbox, Stitch Fix, and Rent the Runway. Now larger retailers such as Trunk Club, Under Armour, Ann Taylor, and GameStop are joining in.
What’s driving the trend? As with many of the changes, big companies are trying to develop ongoing relationships with their customers, while providing value and an element of surprise.
But when it comes to relationships, local merchants are far more effective. Beyond the personal service you deliver on a daily basis, Clover apps such as Rewards let you create a custom loyalty program in minutes, while others like PinPoint Rewards help you expand into member discounts.
You can even develop a subscription box of your own, delivering farm produce or locally made beauty products—whatever you offer that customers need on a regular basis.
5. Mobile-only shopping is gaining ground.

Love it or hate it, but consumers—especially Millennials—are spending more time on their mobile devices. They want digital convenience in the way they shop, purchase, and track spending.
First Data found that banks are developing all-mobile banking apps, such as Finn by Chase or Wells Fargo’s Greenhouse. For merchants, the mobile-only trend means moving beyond the credit or debit card and allowing mobile payments from customers’ smartphones.
Clover’s suite of POS hardware and software lets you accept everything securely—credit cards, EMV chips, and contactless payments from customers. From countertop command centers to small, portable devices, we offer the right solution for every kind of business.
For particularly hectic or mobile operations, consider Clover Go, a contactless reader that works with your smartphone or tablet. This POS lets you secure credit card swipes, dips, and taps like Apple Pay®, Samsung Pay®, and Google Pay®.
The tiny Clover Flex is easy to take with you and hand to customers in your store. They simply dip, swipe, or tap—another quick, safe sale.
It’s easy to feel intimidated when large retailers start entering the small-business arena. But stories such as this one show how independent stores can thrive even as an industry giant fades.
Small business owners have the knowledge, skills, and tools to beat the big guys. Clover is in your corner helping you win.

news_339,news,5 questions to ask before establishing your returns policy,"Return policies are more than legalese—they are a contract with the customer. Done right they can really help generate trust and promotes sales. Done wrong, they can lead to a PR nightmare. Here are 5 questions you should consider when evaluating your return policy.
…",05-04-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-before-establishing-your-returns-policy/,"Return policies are more than legalese—they can really help generate trust with customers and promotes sales. Studies show that 66% of online shoppers check a return policy before making a purchase, and 81% will only purchase if returns are free. Clearly customers are more likely to take a chance on a purchase if they feel they can return items that didn’t work out, and a generous return policy can lead to phenomenal growth. Just take a look at Zappos—an online shoe company that grew to more than 2 billion annual revenue and report their most valuable customers return a staggering 50% of purchases. Yet overly generous return policies can backfire as retailers such as L.L. Bean discovered. After 106 years of offering a no hassle returns L.L. Bean recently restricted their policy to one year after purchase when accompanied by a receipt, which earned them some backlash in the marketplace. Here are 5 questions you should consider when evaluating your return process.
1. What does your state require?
The Federal law only requires merchants to offer a refund if the product was defective or if you’ve broken a sales contract. In some cases, purchases may be subject to a “cooling off” rule, which allows customers to cancel a sale within 3 says if they made the sale in a location other than your place of business such as within their home or workplace. Many states require that you post your policy visibly, so customers know your terms before they complete a purchase. Every state, though, handles returns slightly differently and you should check your local laws to make sure you’re in the clear.
2. What do customers expect?
These days customer expectations are often shaped by major retailers such as Amazon and Walmart, but that doesn’t mean you have to follow suit. Check the policies of similar businesses in your area—how does your policy compare? Does your policy allow for wiggle room? Some policies, such as L.L. Bean’s newly revised policy, allow for exceptions by saying that after the specified period they will work with customers to determine whether there was a defect in the product. This allows their local managers to have discretion over situations where customers might reasonably expect a refund. A simple line at the end of your policy saying, “We stand by our products—please speak with a manager if you’re unhappy” can help deal with grey areas. It also allows managers to bend the rules for your most valuable customers.
Train your staff to handle unhappy customers and address the kinds of things they can do to appease customers who aren’t eligible for a full refund. For example, perhaps they can’t get their money back, but you can offer them a free trial of a new product, or a discount on a replacement product. Often these gestures, along with superb customer service, will satisfy the customer.
3. Will the terms you’re considering endanger your business?
Some research indicates that as much as 30 percent of items purchased will ultimately be returned. If you’re considering a “customer-is-always-right” or “lifetime warranty” policy, make sure you can afford to live by it. L.L. Bean, REI, and Macy’s found that some customers will abuse an overly generous policy and that it was better to place restrictions on returns. If you already have a return policy, check to see what percent of sales get returned and why. Are there particular products that are disproportionately returned? Perhaps you should reconsider stocking them. Are the items returned in saleable condition? If not, perhaps tweaking the policy would help limit your losses. Above all, make sure your policy is sustainable, because your most loyal customers will come to expect consistent service and policies.
4. Under what conditions will you allow customers to return or exchange items?
Most return and refund policies will specify how long the customer has to return or
exchange items, whether they need proof of purchase, and in what condition the items need to be. Here are some conditions you should consider:

Time limit. Even retailers who are historically very generous are now limiting their return policy to a year or less.
Condition of product. Common phrases such as “normal wear and tear” or “products found to be defective” are helpful for defining grey areas. Ideally, most of your returns will be in resalable condition, so try to word the policy to require good condition barring any defects or error on your part.
Shipping or related costs. Don’t forget to consider costs associated with doing business such as shipping. Make sure your policy is clear on who pays those fees. Some businesses charge a restocking fee to help cover these miscellaneous costs.
Full refund or store credit. How will you issue a return—cash or credit?

To make sure your policy covers all the basics, consider using Clover’s Return Policy Tool.
5. Will you require proof of purchase?
Many merchants require proof of purchase before issuing a return, such as a receipt. This can be a hassle for customers who received your product as a gift, or who simply didn’t keep the receipt. In these cases, some merchants will allow returns with a valid photo ID, or will attempt to look up the purchase in their POS system. Carefully consider whether you’ll require proof of purchase and then make sure your staff know how to look up purchases if the customer no longer has a receipt.
In the end, return policies are all about setting expectations on how your customers will be treated, and following through with those promises. Once you have a clear policy in place, be sure to communicate it online and in your store. Besides setting clear expectations, consider adding a little personality or humor to your policy. For example, “We hate chipped nails as much as you do! We’ll happily touch up any manicure within 24 hours of service” is a subtle reminder that you’re a small business, not a big chain store, and that superb customer service and quality products are your goal.

More than 80% of Instagram users follow a business on the app. If they’re not following yours, maybe it’s time for a change. With a little effort, Instagram can be a great marketing tool for local businesses. …",09-04-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/design-for-better-business-6-instagram-tips-for-local-businesses/,"The recent turmoil surrounding Facebook’s data privacy breach has social media users running for the hills. Your customers might not be viewing your Facebook page as much as they used to. As a result, it could be time to diversify your marketing strategy to include other social media platforms beyond Facebook and Twitter.
Enter Instagram. Local businesses can and should build an Instagram following to keep their business front-and-center no matter where the trends take social media users. Consider this: according to Forbes, more than 80% of Instagram users follow a business on the app. In one month, more than 120 million users went to a business’s Instagram profile to visit a website, get directions or contact a firm.
Instagram can seem intimidating at first glance. We have good news. You don’t need to be a professional photographer or designer to harness the power of this visual platform. Here’s how to get the most return on investment from an Instagram profile for your business.
1. Decide if you REALLY need an Instagram.
Not all businesses really need an Instagram profile. Consider your unique product or service before jumping into the Instagram deep end. Who is your typical customer? According to researchers, 59% of Instagram users are 18 – 29 years old. If you’re selling to an older audience, Instagram may not be the best investment of your time and resources. Likewise, if you have a product that isn’t easily represented visually—accounting services or plumbing, for example—you may want to skip Instagram and look to LinkedIn or Google Maps for a new line of social marketing.
2. Focus on the profile.
Too often, businesses forget that the profile part of their Instagram is the most important part of the whole venture. Think of your Instagram profile as a sales funnel: this is what people will find when they search for your business. Instagram limits your bio section to 150 characters. Make sure to include keywords from your industry to make your account easy to find. Use emojis, formatting, and spacing (try an app like Notes to get the formatting just right) to give your profile a unique look. The link in your bio is the only clickable link you can provide on Instagram, so be sure to connect your profile to the right landing page with a call to action.
3. Set a few rules for your posts.
Instagram is one platform where you want to find some consistency between your posts so your brand can stand out from the crowd. Start by laying down some ground rules for the kinds of things you will and will not post. If you’re not sure what photos to post, go back to the core of your business. Brainstorm everything that comes to mind that makes your business unique. A hair salon might say “wedding up-dos, unique color, and warm staff.” From there, you have your key content pillars: in this example, the Instagram profile would feature wedding hair, #rainbowhair, and profiles of your stylists.
Visually, find a filter that you think reflects your style. Use consistent hashtags so users can find you—and spread the word about your business. The goal is to get users to recognize and stop scrolling when they see your image. Click through to see some examples of businesses that have mastered visual content.
4. Host a contest on Instagram.
Looking for some engagement on your posts? Host a contest! There are a few rules for hosting contests on Instagram (and if you don’t follow the terms and conditions, you may find your profile suspended). Here’s what to do:

Set a goal for your contest. Do you want users to like, follow, or comment on your posts?
It is required that you choose a hashtag to track users. Specifically, Instagram promotion guidelines state, “You must not inaccurately tag content or encourage users to inaccurately tag content (ex: don’t encourage people to tag themselves in photos if they aren’t in the photo).”
Decide on a rubric (i.e. most likes, reviewed by a panel, etc.)and clearly articulate how will you select the winners.
Broadcast the rules, terms and conditions that your users must follow.
Promote the contest (you may also want to advertise the contest on your other social media channels).
Pick a winner! And make sure to notify all contestants when you’ve chosen your winner.

Need some ideas? Ask your followers to take photos of your product in creative places for a chance to win a free upgrade. Have your followers tag a friend they would bring to your business for a chance to win free perks. Find ways to have your followers spread the word about your company—and reward their loyalty with more of what they love.
5. Use Instagram Stories.
Instagram Stories are on the rise: 300 million people now view and post Instagram Stories every day. Instagram Stories can be much more personal than a typical Instagram post. With these videos, you can take users behind the scenes and increase engagement through polls, focused hashtags, and links. Handover your Instagram to an employee for a “staff takeover” of your business. Go behind-the-scenes to show customers what goes into your most popular recipes. Crowdsource opinions on new products or menu offerings through Instagram Polls. Put the power of video into your marketing strategy without having to hire a camera crew.
6. Keep track of what’s working.
There are lots of tools in your Instagram tool kit—so how do you know what’s working? Which posts get the most engagement, and why? Keep track of your account with Instagram Reporting tools, which put all your data in one clean dashboard. You can play around with variables like hashtags, posting times, popular filters, and more. Third party apps like Iconosquare, SumAll, Simply Measured, and Sprout Social are all free tools to give you deeper data on what’s working and what’s not.
Social media can rapidly become overwhelming, and trends change constantly. With a little time and elbow grease, maintaining an Instagram account can have big impact on your marketing. Whether it’s shooting an Instagram story on the fly or handing over your account for a staff takeover, find a way to have fun with this platform!
If you want to dig even deeper, try Clover’s Customer Engagement suite to get repeat visits, reach out to previous customers and get feedback you can use.

The three apps in this month’s spotlight are quickly becoming some of our merchants’ favorites. Whether they’re running a restaurant or managing a retail outlet, these apps are helping them get the most out of their Clover devices.
ShopScanGo
It’s not the first time we’ve featured ShopScanGo, but they’ve made some significant (and awesome) updates. Competing with AmazonGo, their new app lets customers enter the store, scan items as they go, and pay without waiting in line. Merchants will see on their Clover when a ShopScanGo user comes in and will be able to identify them by a photo that pops up right on the POS. Verifying that users have paid is a cinch, and the time and resources saved is enormous.
ShopScanGo helps you eliminate lines, provides total inventory synchronization, and offers parallel consumer in-store transactions. Best of all, it’s compatible with Register Lite, Register Classic, Clover Station, Clover Mini, Clover Mobile, and Clover Flex. It can even ensure you present the right discount to the right customer at the right time.
Rental Timer
Say you’re one of those merchants who rents out items short term, like a bicycle or a gardening equipment. Rental Timer is for you! It allows merchants to time rentals for a variety of items and different rates with ease. At the end of the rental, totals are calculated automatically, including overages.
Rental Timer puts you in complete control. It makes it easy to charge by the minute, hour, or day. Easy pop-ups let you adjust an order if there are customer service issues. And you can always adjust the final price at the end of the timer. You can take it for a spin with a 30-day free trial.
Wait List
Tired of watching your customers wait in line? Wait List is your answer. For any business that has a wait list (restaurant, nail salon, spa, even personalized retail), this app organizes the wait list, provides estimated times, and interacts with customers through Facebook Messenger to communicate updates and let people know when it is their turn.
Wait List’s smart wait time can estimate for parties of different sizes, meaning you don’t have to do the calculations on your own. It features a low flat monthly fee, no setup or transaction costs. It also comes with unlimited messenger notifications and free updates and support.
With Clover (and the Clover App Market) in your corner, you’ll find yourself doing more in less time, improving your customer experience, and working more efficiently than ever before.

On the mound, the average pitcher’s fastball is clocking in greater than 92 miles per hour, an increase of nearly four mph since the late 90s. And batters are launching balls out of the park at record speeds – now measured in baseball’s trendiest offensive metric, exit velocity. Paired with other advanced metrics captured throughout each game, precise numbers like pitch, speed, and exit velocity are providing the game’s best and brightest access to detailed insights that are helping reshape America’s pastime into a data-driven game, focused on analytics and situational optimization.
With speed and analytics reshaping how the game is played on the field, the New York Mets are putting both to their use off of it as well – turning to a partnership with Clover to, among other things, improve each fan’s speed to pay in 2018. And doing so while gaining deeper insight in to how, when, and where money is spent throughout the park.
Clover, which processes EMV transactions in less than three seconds, has been fully implemented at hundreds of restaurants and bars, portable concessions outlets, and can be found in numerous lounges and clubs throughout the venue – including the First Data Club and Home Plate Lounge. Clover’s total implementation at Citi Field is comprised of more than 700 fully integrated Clover devices, including Clover Station, Clover Mini, and Clover Mobile.
That’s great news for Mets fans! It means they’ll slide through concession lines quicker than ever in 2018, and be back in their seats to watch one of baseball’s hottest teams through early April.
A leading point of sale platform for businesses of all sizes, Clover lets each merchant accept payments from customers, safely and securely. Clover will also allow vendors to offer an array of payment types to each Citi Field customer, including EMV, contactless, NFC (near field communication), gift cards, and popular digital wallets like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay.
While Mets fans are enjoying shorter wait times as they search for a quick snack or cool beverage between innings, Clover’s integration at Citi Field is also putting a robust set of data and analytics at the fingertips of Mets executives. Clover’s analytics will afford stadium personnel access to detailed sales data that yields valuable insight into when, where, and how each fan spends their money, and can also be used to optimize future fan/concession experiences throughout the ballpark.
Implementing Clover at Citi Field came with an assist from First Data’s partners at Bypass, an independent software vendor (ISV) that has integrated their stadium-specific software solution directly into Clover’s platform. First Data’s partnership with Bypass dates back to a 2016 launch into CenturyLink Field (home of the Seattle Seahawks) and has now helped place Clover into 15 major sporting venues. Together, Clover and Bypass are working to revolutionize the fan experience at stadiums across the United States.

news_344,news,Enterprise behavior: How to price a product profitably,"Deciding on product pricing structure is one of the single most challenging responsibilities of a small business owner. Read on to learn how to make some of these calculations, and what the numbers can tell you about your pricing plans.
…",17-04-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-how-to-price-a-product-profitably/,"What are some best practices of large corporations that smaller businesses can scale down and make work for them? Visit the Clover blog’s Enterprise Behavior topic page for more!
Pricing products is one of the single biggest challenges of a small business owner. There’s plenty of math involved, but there’s also a need for anticipating customer’s emotional responses to price. This issue is so complex that many product verticals regularly provide Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Pricing (MSRP) to guide merchants on a pricing strategy.
This post examines the most common models for calculating retail prices, namely Cost Plus Pricing, Demand Pricing, and Competitive Pricing.
Read on to learn how to make these calculations, and what the numbers can tell you about your pricing plans. Before diving into the three pricing models, let’s start by defining two key concepts: cost versus expense. These are both cornerstone numbers for any pricing model calculation.
1. Cost
What it tells you: Cost, in this context, means the amount of money it takes to have the product for sale. This includes materials, manufacturing, and any shipment charges.
If we imagine a store that sells customized widgets, there will be three factors in calculating the cost per widget.
Materials: $18.00
Shipment: $1.50
Customization: $7.00
Cost = Materials + Shipment + Customization
Cost = $18.00 + $1.50 + $7.00 = $26.50 per widget
How to use it: It’s crucial to know your hard costs when you plan your pricing. Regardless of which pricing model you employ, you need to be exceedingly clear on your product cost.

2. Expense
What it tells you: Expenses include all the other costs of you running a business that allows you to sell your customized widgets. This includes (but is not limited to) rent and utilities for retail or workshop space; equipment required to customize the widgets; delivery fees for mail orders; financing costs (like interest on a small business loan); employee wages; et cetera.
But that’s not all. Also important to factor in are employee discounts offered, marketing budget, insurance costs, and the cost of damaged or unsold merchandise. These are all factors that can sap your bank account without necessarily translating to revenue. This may be your most difficult calculation in the pricing process, but take your time and do it properly.
It can be a bit tricky to calculate expenses per widget, but you need to have that information. Think conservatively about how many widgets you think you’re going to sell in a given month. Then divide the total expenses by the number of widgets.
Rent: $1350
Utilities: $245
Equipment: $87
Financing: $58
Wages: $9,500
Damaged goods: $53
Marketing: $350
Insurance: $210
TOTAL: $11,853
Number of widgets sold in a month: 495
Expense = Sum of expenses per month ÷ Number of widgets sold per month
Expense = $11,853 ÷ 495 = $23.95 per widget
How to use it: A lot of people refer to selling product “at cost,” but they don’t always factor in the expenses a business incurs to keep the lights on and the doors open in a business. If you sell a product for less than the sum of cost and expense, you will be operating at a loss.

3. Cost Plus pricing
What it tells you: Nobody starts a business with the hope of breaking even, so building profit into your pricing model is a very important step. The Cost Plus pricing model adds either a percentage or a flat figure profit to the cost and expenses of a widget to determine the price.
Price = [Cost + Expense] + Profit
Price = [$26.50 + $23.95] + Profit = $50.45 + Profit
Price = $50.45 + $10.09 (20% profit) = $60.54
How to use it: Calculating a Cost Plus price allows you to plan for financial success, but also creates a buffer if your sales are slightly lower in volume than expected. A 20% profit might be a wonderful goal, but perhaps in some months that figure is lower. You can offer coupons at this price and still be protected from losing money on your transactions.
4. Demand pricing
What it tells you: Moving away from the Cost Plus pricing model, demand pricing is best for unique goods and services with limited availability on the market. This is particularly useful for pricing things like haircuts or spa services. (If you notice a particular employee is always booked up in advance, try raising the price per service).
In the case of our widgets, let’s say your customizations separate them from other widgets on the market. Sales go from the anticipated 495 units per month to over 700 per month, and you’re having trouble keeping up with production. Try increasing the price to see what the market will sustain. If people are happy paying $75 for your customized widgets, let them!
Let’s calculate the new profit assuming you sell 495 units at $80 (it’ll be higher if you sell more).
Profit = Price – [Cost + Expense]
Profit = $75 – $50.45 = $24.55
Percent Profit = Profit ÷ [Cost + Expense] = $24.55 ÷ $50.45 = 49%
How to use it: Demand pricing can be very sensitive, but if you notice that you can’t keep up with demand for your product, you may be undercharging. Try raising things incrementally and observing how sales numbers and profits are affected. You should definitely use Clover Insights to help analyze your data and track performance when calculating demand pricing.
5. Competitive Pricing
What it tells you: Competitive pricing is key when other retails or service providers offer the same wares as you. If you are offering similar products, it’s important to stay in a similar price range. However, if you are offering a higher-end product, pricing should reflect that. The same is true if you are offering a lower-cost alternative to a similar product.
There are no special calculations for competitive pricing, but you need to use your cost and expense information to make sure you stay within healthy margins. Your research should encompass both the theoretical and practical. Start by searching for “profit margins for [your business type]” to find reputable sources like these posts on profit margins for bar inventory and profit margins for coffee shops. On the practical side, go shopping in your neighborhood. What do your local competitors charge for products similar to yours? What factors might explain any variance?
How to use it: Often times competitive pricing leads to lower sales prices at higher volumes. When you want to maximize your profit, it’s important to keep your cost and expenses as low as possible. To that end, you can use your calculations along with research on your competitors to try to negotiate better deals with your suppliers, landlord, etc. Just make sure you don’t let yourself get so caught up in competition that you lose track of your own profitability.
No matter how you look at it, pricing is a complicated issue. But if you work carefully and observe the effects of your decisions on your bottom line, you’ll learn a lot. A little bit of math goes a long way.

Those first years, new business owners must fight for survival as they juggle to secure financing, build a team, attract customers and so much more. It’s no wonder that 20 percent of small businesses fail before their first year and about a third won’t survive through their second year.
But aspiring merchants can set themselves up for success by launching a business in a strong industry with the best profits.
Read on to learn more about the most profitable and least profitable industries for small businesses in 2018.
MOST PROFITABLE:
Accounting and financial services
From serving individuals and businesses, there will always be demand for accounting services, making this a stable business in a variety of economic environments.
Additionally, as baby boomers move toward retirement, demand for financial planning services are expected to grow at a much faster rate than other occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While these services require a bachelor’s degree and additional training, the overhead for these businesses are minimal. The median pay is about $90,000 per year and the industry is expected to grow 15 percent from 2016 to 2026.
Landlords
Today, there are more renters in the U.S. than any point in the last 50 years, giving a major boost to the rental market. Landlords must invest significant capital to purchase and manage properties, but once established, the business can be profitable.
Home improvements
The average household spends about $3,000 per year on home renovations, which creates business opportunities for those skilled in fixing and updating houses. Startup costs include tools, training and licensing, which are much lower than for businesses like new home construction. Since the work takes you onsite to customer homes, that eliminates the need for renting a space for your business, too. You can scale up your business with time by starting off as an individual contractor and then, as you build your reputation and network, you can act as a general contractor, hiring or subcontracting work to others.
And when you’re taking in business on the go, you’ll want to use products like Clover Go, a portable device that lets you securely accept all forms of payment – swipe, “chip” and NFC contactless mobile payments like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay. And you won’t have to worry about consolidating all of your transactions; with Clover Go, all of your data gets centralized in your Clover POS.
Vaping retailer
As consumers seek alternatives to tobacco, the e-cigarette industry has begun to boom. A Wells Fargo tobacco analyst predicts the industry in the U.S. will expand around 15 percent to $5.1 billion in retail sales this year.
Aspiring merchants should keep in mind that opening a vape shop could could cost between about $7,000 to $10,000 per month—and that doesn’t include the cost of the product. Another challenge: banks put vape shops in a riskiest category, which means they charge more for your loan and make it harder to get a loan in the first place. But for merchants who plan wisely, research the market and tap into the right customer base, this could be a profitable venture.
LEAST PROFITABLE
Real estate services
Buying a new house requires spending money on inspectors, appraisers, title companies, loan brokers and more. An aspiring entrepreneur may think: why not put myself on the receiving end of all that cash?
Those services can be very lucrative and they require little capital and training to get started, but you’d be up against a crowded marketplace and tremendous competition, according to Fundera. Home buyers tend to rely on their realtors for recommendations, and the bulk of a market is controlled by a few top realtors who already have their referral relationships established. As most of your revenue will be commission-based, you’ll need a high volume of customers to keep your business running. That means you’ll need to work extra hard to break into an already crowded market.
Recreation services
Running an amusement park, movie theater or golf course may seem like a dream – pleasure and profit all at the same time! But this can be a tough industry to survive in, according to Funderea. The high costs to run these kinds of operations don’t go away. Recreation businesses also face tough competition, as a wide variety of services are vying for the limited free time of consumers. And of course, when the economy dips, spending on fun is the one of the first thing customers cut from their budgets.
Furniture store
Even if you have the most stylish house and a passion for furniture design, think twice about opening a furniture store. It’s a business that pairs high overhead costs with measly mark-up rates. On top of that, you’ll be dealing with stiff competition from online discount shops like Overstock and Wayfair. On average, furniture retailers bring in a paltry 3.3% pre-tax profits.
Travel lodging
Similar to recreational services, opening a bed and breakfast or a boutique hotel loses some appeal when faced with its narrow profit margin. When dealing with steep fixed costs coupled with competition from cheaper options like motels and Airbnb, profits take a hit, leading to average pretax profits of independent inns and hotels at a mere 0.26 percent.
Now that you have a lay of the land, you’re better equipped to start a small business in a robust industry. But you’ll need many tools to get you from idea to launch day, and your friends at Clover have you covered. First off, you’ll want to decide on the formal structure of your business. S-Corp, DBA, LLC? We decode these for you here. Next, you’ll need to understand the vital due diligence steps you’ll need to take for a successful start.

news_347,news,"Business accelerators: Perfect your sales pitch, part 2","Many people have an aversion to sales. They don’t like being sold to, and they don’t like feeling like they are pushing other people into buying. Yet, your customer experience is only as good as your sales staff. Here are 7 tips for training your staff to close the deal.
…",23-04-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-perfect-your-sales-pitch-part-2/,"This is the second post in our “Perfect your sales pitch” series. You can read the first installment here.
If your team isn’t confident and motivated to sell your products, your storefront will struggle with reaching its full potential. Unfortunately, many people are uncomfortable with the sales process and have an aversion to selling. Luckily, training and practice can overcome this obstacle and help your team close more sales. Here are a few pointers on how to perfect your team’s sales pitch:
Provide first-hand experience with your products.
Part of what sets small businesses apart from big-box stores or buying products online is personalized attention and expertise. Every member of the staff should know what you offer in your store, the answers to common questions, and have had personal experience with products. It’s one thing to tell a customer what the specials are—it’s another to say they personally tried it and liked it. They should also know the ingredients (or know how to look it up) to make sure they can respond to specific requests or allergy issues.
Encourage expertise in your industry.
Whatever role your staff plays they should be passionate about it. Stylists, for example, should not only have a firm grasp on what is currently popular, they should know what types of styles look best on different body and face types. When customers visit stores in person they are often hoping to get customized feedback and answers to questions they can’t find on the internet.
Define a good customer experience.
You want your store to have consistent customer service and for customers to know they can count on you to provide a professional experience. Teach every member of your staff to see to all the details that make your store stand out. Do you offer a free beverage to customers while they are waiting? Do you remember them by name and offer personalized recommendations? Do you give a free 5-minute shoulder massage with every manicure? These are the details that customers remember and expect the next time they are in your store.
Sell benefits, not features.
Elmer Wheeler coined the phrase, “Sell the sizzle, not the steak” back in the 1920’s and it’s still relevant today. Too often, salespeople rattle off features of products, which commoditizes the product. Instead they should appeal to the senses and emotions of customers. They should sell the benefits of using it.
Meet customers where they are.
There’s a subtle art to persuasion, and part of it rests on whether the customer feels understood. Staff should know what kinds of questions to ask, and actively listen to the responses. Before they make personalized recommendations, they should repeat what they think they heard and ask for confirmation that they understood the request correctly. Sometimes customers are not ready to jump into a purchase, or don’t agree with the recommendations. At that point the salesperson should recalibrate their recommendations based on the feedback they’re hearing.
Only present relevant solutions.
Most people are wary of salespeople, because they don’t want the confrontation of having to say no. Staff can lower this aversion to the sales process by being friendly and helpful, but any trust they build up through rapport can evaporate if they start presenting random products or services and trying to sell them. Teach your staff to tailor their responses to what the customer is saying and to only present relevant solutions.
Speak the customer’s (body) language.
Teach employees to make eye contact with every customer, to be approachable, and friendly. Being approachable includes smiling and greeting customers, but it also includes not looking at their phones while on duty and not plugging their ears with headphones. One step beyond that is to read the customer’s body language. If the staff is presenting a product or service and the customer’s face closes up, or they drop eye contact or take a step away, it’s a sign they are not interested. If this happens, staff should check in with the customer and ask a non-threatening question like, “Is this what you had in mind, or were you looking for something else?”
Sales is an art, not a science, and it pays to practice sales scenarios with your staff. If you find you have a sales superstar, consider setting up a mentoring relationship with other staff members to train them on subtle techniques that will help close the deal.

…",26-04-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/the-5-biggest-mistakes-new-small-business-owners-make-when-redesigning-their-website/,"A website redesign is one of the most exciting projects a small business can undertake. The promise of a new look-and-feel along with improved functionality is enough to make any small business owner go all in. But there are some pitfalls small business owners consistently hit when redesigning their sites. Read on as we examine some of the most common mistakes, and how to avoid them.
1. Failing to establish a keyword strategy
Without knowing what keywords customers are searching for, there’s no chance of ranking on the first page. Tools like Google Keyword Planner are perfect for helping find popular keywords. Keep in mind, there is a difference between branded keywords and non-branded. Typically, unless the business is very well known, most people will search for non-branded keywords. Keyword Planner will help reveal what people are searching for. From there, those keywords should be used throughout the site in title tags, body copy, and blog posts. If possible, hire a search engine optimization (SEO) professional that can create a keyword strategy and plan content for your new website.
2. Failing to recognize existing links connect to non-existent pages
This can create a broken link on another site, or even on your own. Instead, it’s important to establish 301 redirects for each URL removed and point it to the new page. If there isn’t a corresponding page, choose the best page to point it to, even if it is your new homepage.
3. Failing to create a Google Analytics account
A Google Analytics account will allow you to measure incoming traffic and to understand how people are navigating and engaging with your website.
4. Failing to recognize that they can control their site
Gone are the days of needing to hire a developer to build and manage your site. By choosing a Content Management System (CMS) such as Squarespace, Wix, or WordPress, you’ll be able to add new pages, sell online, or easily change information all on your own, without contacting a developer.
5. Thinking the site needs to be perfect before launching
Marketers often subscribe to a philosophy called Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which means that they prefer launching with the essentials and then adding and adjusting the site later as they learn and have the time and budget. This approach speeds up the launch date dramatically and allows the business owner to get real-time feedback from their website. For example, let’s say you run a clothing retail shop and you have a backlog of product you need to photograph. Instead of waiting to launch the site until you hire a photographer to photograph and edit all of that new product, launch with the product you have and start selling.
By adhering to these five tips, your small business is sure to get the most bang for your buck as you redesign your site.

news_350,news,Is your cashier checkout script boosting profits?,"A customer’s checkout experience is a critical point where you can boost profits. At a minimum, it can leave a customer with warm feelings about your business. At maximum, it can mean more dollars in the bank. Here are some ways to capitalize on checkout to deliver bigger sales.
…",02-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/is-your-cashier-checkout-script-boosting-profits/,"One of the things that makes a small business stand out from the crowd? Personal interaction. Gallup found that 70% of Americans have confidence in small businesses as a result of personal experience. Conversely, only 21% of Americans feel that same confidence in big businesses. Amazon might be taking over the world, but customers still prefer the close relationship they have with local merchants.
Building a relationship with your customers comes naturally to many small business owners. As a result, you may not think strategically about the “script” that guides the interaction between your team and a customer during the checkout process. It’s just a moment for friendly conversation, no?
Actually, customer checkout is a critical moment when you can use that great relationship to boost your profits. Think of the interaction at checkout as the cherry on the shopper experience sundae: at a minimum, it can leave your customer with warm happy feelings about your business. At maximum, it can lead to a few more dollars in the bank–and perhaps some new loyal fans. Here are some ways to make sure your cashiers capitalize on your business’s great reputation to deliver bigger sales during checkout.
1. Smile and make eye contact.
It sounds basic, but one of the best ways to connect with your customer is to make eye contact and smile. Eye contact can make an interaction more memorable, more persuasive, and more appealing. Even when checkout lines get busy, this is the one thing your cashiers should always do. It personalizes the customer’s experience and keeps the relationship human. When was the last time you made eye contact with an Amazon drone?
2. Nail the cross-sell.
Upselling and cross-selling is important–but it needs to hit the right tone. Train your cashiers to keep the product suggestions low-key and relevant to the customer’s recent purchase. A conversational tone helps a lot. For example, try something like, “I love pairing that marinara you bought with this wonderful Barolo red we carry.” If they express any interest, make sure the cashier can send a floater to grab a bottle. Pro-tip: don’t make a cross-sell or upsell on items of a personal nature.
3. Yes, and…
In improv comedy, one of the key things performers learn to be good partners is the phrase “yes, and.” Your cashiers can use that phrase too, especially since improvisation is key! During checkout, don’t make all of your employees up-sell the same product. Let them improvise and suggest products based on context. You can give them a cheat sheet of pairings they might throw out there based on a customer’s basket. Bottom line: cashiers shouldn’t sound like robots.
4. Reward your VIPs with TLC
As a small business owner, you probably know who your regulars and VIP customers are. But as you grow, your employees may not share that knowledge. Clover Rewards lets your cashiers know when they’re dealing with a VIP and roll out the red carpet accordingly. Research shows that existing customers spend 67% more than new customers and help bring new customers through the door. Therefore, your checkout experience should be the icing on the cake when it comes to shopping at your business.
5. Move fast when necessary.
Save the small talk for when foot traffic is slow! When things are busy, cashiers need to move fast while still seeming friendly. A little grace under pressure goes a long way—and Clover can help make lines flow smoothly. The Clover Flex and Clover Mini allow you to take orders while people wait (aka, “line busting”). During rush hour, the Clover Go can help you process payments faster by activating other employees to check out customers. Plus, the new Station-Mini combo makes it easy for the customer to complete checking out while the cashier is freed up to bag products or run down items as needed.
6. Refine and perfect.
Who is your team’s all-star? Figure out what they’re doing right, and share their script with the rest of the team. It gives you a good opportunity for a little employee recognition, as well as the chance to perfect what’s working. Co-creating a script with cashiers’ input will make it 1000x times better. They’ll help you reveal operational holes and ways to structure your team. Learn if you need to free up people to help during a rush, or to empower cross-selling at other points of the customer journey.
7. Count change and prevent fraud.
Dealing with cash? Make sure you’re cutting down on mistakes and not missing money. It’s a good practice to count back the change to a customer instead of handing them a bunch of bills. If there is ever a dispute, your cashier can show that it is unlikely to be their fault (or remedy the mistake quickly).
8. Make it easy on your cashiers
Your cashiers aren’t Broadway stars, nor should they be forced to memorize a script on top of their other responsibilities. Try using the Employee Reminder app to send messages periodically to your Clover device prompting them to make cross-sells, upsells, or just remember to smile. There’s no need to micromanage, but sometimes a friendly reminder is all it takes to boost a customer’s checkout experience.

news_351,news,"5 types of restaurant employee theft, and how to prevent them","Employee theft is a major problem in the restaurant industry. From unlicensed snacking to skimming cash, restaurants lose between $3-6 billion annually from staff with sticky fingers. Here’s what to do to protect your business—and prevent it from happening again. …",02-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-types-of-restaurant-employee-theft-and-how-to-prevent-them/,"Theft is an issue for many small businesses, but nowhere is the problem worse than at restaurants. In addition to managing the natural shrinkage that comes from running a business, restaurants face the unique problem that nearly everything is easily consumable.
A survey uncovered that internal employee theft is responsible for 75% of inventory shortages and about 4% of restaurant sales. That totals between between $3 and $6 billion annually. Lest you think that employee theft at restaurants is isolated to a few bad apples (pun intended), it’s actually a widespread problem. About 75% of employees steal from their workplace at least once, if not repeatedly.
Theft at restaurants is a big problem, but there are ways to cut down on the impact employee theft has on your bottom line. Likewise, how you respond to theft when you catch an employee in the act has a big effect on that repeat-offender statistic. Here are some of the most prevalent types of employee theft, ways to prevent theft in your restaurants, and some tactics to take if it happens again.
Food and Inventory Theft
This is one of the most common ways employees are taking from your business. This kind of theft includes:

snacking on your supplies (outside their allotted shift meal),
giving (unauthorized) free meals to friends and family,
taking food home, or
straight up stealing supplies off the delivery truck

It all adds up, one peanut at a time. A big red flag? If your alcohol stores are consistently low. Many restaurants miss alcohol theft, but booze can be a big-ticket item if you’re running through your supplies quickly.
How do you combat food theft? Invest in an inventory management tool. Clover POS comes with a powerful inventory tracking system, and you can add an app from the Clover App Market to customize your system to your needs. Try the Avero App, Shopventory, or Orca Inventory Management for an app customized for restaurants. To cut down on all those free lunches, try using Clover Rewards for more oversight on who is being rewarded for their loyalty.
Likewise, if you’re tracking your inventory management and able to identify the root of the problem, consider locking your freezer, offering a bigger pre-shift meal, or picking up some treats outside your inventory for your team to snack on.
Checkout Theft
Though second to food theft, point-of-sale theft is more common than you may think. Checkout theft includes

taking cash from the register,
voiding ordered items,
improperly ringing up items,
inflating tips, or
dropping sales.

For example, a bartender may be ringing up premium drinks and charging customers for well drinks (and pocketing the difference). A digital POS like Clover can help you identify where receipts do not match the sales, but other red flags include low morale or managers making a lot of voids at the end of a shift.
Checkout theft can be largely prevented with automated POS systems. A good way to keep everyone honest is to give each of your servers a checkout system on the go that sends data back into the central POS kiosk. Clover Go lets servers cash out tableside, letting the customer add a tip directly into the system. In addition, use Clover integrations like Ping Me If, Bottle Keeper, and Cash Track to trigger alerts when certain events happen. This lets you monitor cash in and cash out, keep an eye on a certain item, and even track your liquid stock so you don’t have to count bottles each day.
If your system is already running like a finely tuned machine, there are other signals to watch for surrounding checkout theft. Look for changes in employee behavior: defensiveness or being secretive around their tips and transactions are bad signs. Keep an eye on your customer reviews, as complaints about price increases can alert you to price inflation.
Accounting Fraud
Accounting theft goes hand-in-hand with checkout theft. This more long-term and insidious form of theft is harder to spot. When left unchecked, it can have serious impact on your business. Forms of accounting fraud include

manipulating voids,
canceling checks,
skimming cash,
underreporting earnings on the balance sheet,
or setting up fake accounts payable.

Clover can help prevent accounting fraud by giving you a clear picture of your payments and receipts. Clover Payments Plus surfaces your business metrics to show you cash in and cash out, sales, employee management and scheduling, and inventory tracking, all in one dashboard. Discover trends and deeper insight insights you might not usually see each day to keep track of your managers.
Because this type of theft is so intentional, there’s more you can do as a business owners to prevent accounting fraud. If you’re generous, transparent, and fair with your people, you’ll attract like-minded employees who frown on bad actors. Evaluate the employee perks you already offer (are you being needlessly cheap?), but also the tone you set at work. If people feel empowered and are treated like grownups, they usually rise to the occasion.
Intellectual Property Theft
There’s a reason why grandma’s secret recipe was kept secret—it’s so no one else steals your menu items and runs you out of business! Of course, when you hire a chef, you want to let their talent shine, but you need to protect your intellectual property? Think about how to protect things like:

proprietary recipes,
ingredients lists,
cooking processes,
and branding

The restaurant industry is a lot smaller than you might think, and you might see the same staff, servers, and chefs working in different restaurants seasonally or part-time. It’s hard to protect your secret ingredients from becoming public knowledge. You may want to have your kitchen staff sign a nondisclosure agreement, or keep your recipes under lock and key when not in use. Again, this is where being a great boss can really work to your advantage. Give your staff trust and respect, and they’ll usually repay you in kind.
Time Theft
Time theft is especially common (and sometime inadvertent) with employees who clock-in and clock-out. When they’re on a shift, you expect them to be present and working—after all, that’s what you’re paying them for! But unscheduled breaks or wasted time both damages your restaurant’s efficiency (and profit) and causes you to lose money and time. Time theft includes:

unscheduled breaks,
doctored timesheets,
lateness or leaving early,
phone breaks.

There are some handy Clover apps that help employees check in and check out with ease. Timeclock for Restaurants is customized for the hospitality industry, but you should also try 7Punches and Shifts.
Trying to cut down on unscheduled breaks? Start by setting forth a phone policy that lets your workers know when and where they can stop to check their phones. Ideally, phone time is outside of the busiest moments in your restaurant. Acknowledging that your staff needs time to check in on social media or text for a ride home is is a good first step. Of course, you don’t want to spy on or micromanage your employees. That wouldn’t be fun for anyone! But you can install cameras in your restaurant to try to discover if your phone policy is working. Likewise, have a set break policy and let employees know the specifics. Breaks are crucial in this industry, so be generous but clear with your break policy.
Future Theft Prevention: Last Words
There are plenty of tools you can use to identify the source of theft in your restaurant. But, the best way to prevent theft comes from you, the business owner. Employees need to realize that your response sends a strong message.
Determine the severity of the theft: obviously not all infractions are created equally. Time theft and fraud are two different things. Whatever disciplinary measures you take against the employee, do so discreetly. Being forceful, aggressive, or embarrassing a staff member will only lead to other workers sympathizing with the culprit. After you’ve dealt directly with the scenario, hold a staff meeting to explain what happened, what actions you take, and what you’re prepared to do if it ever happens again. Theft happens, but dealing with it appropriately is up to you!

news_352,news,Growing pains: Adding a middle manager to your team (part 2),"Nothing says “success” quite like hiring a middle manager. That’s because managers are crucial for growth, whether you’re expanding to a second location or adding new services. Find out how to land a great manager who will help accelerate the business and simplify your life.
…",03-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-adding-a-middle-manager-to-your-team-part-2/,"This is the second article in a series. Read part 1 here. 
Nothing says “success” quite like hiring a middle manager. But that extra layer between the boss and the frontline isn’t just for show.
Managers help small businesses accelerate growth, whether expanding to a second location, adding mobile services, or boosting hours and employees at the current location.
The downside is that middle management can add complexity for business owners. What roles and duties are you ready to delegate? How do you stay on top of the important details? Who do you hire to shoulder the responsibility?
Read on for tips about how to land a manager who will improve operations, jumpstart growth, and simplify your life.
Map out your weak spots.
While it might be clear that you need extra help, it’s not always clear where you need it most. Before you launch into job hiring, ask honest questions.
Do you need a point person for the evening shift so you can go home? Are you tired of employee issues and need a cheerful, organized manager to take over staffing and resolve problems? Or maybe you need technical talent to run the online store and inventory?
Once you figure out what tasks the manager will oversee, it’s easier to see what qualities you need in that person, from strong people skills and functional expertise to strategic thinking and the ability to take initiative.
Look for character, not just experience.
Unless you’ve got a specific person in mind, hiring the right manager takes some time and care. If you race through the process, you’re likely to hand the job to the first candidate meeting minimal qualifications.
Many HR pros swear by performance-based interviewing questions, which draw out a clearer picture of a candidate’s qualities. Instead of generic questions, you dig for specific information about how people handled situations in their last job: “Tell me about a time when…”
Past performance can point to future success. It also reveals how people cope with stress, negotiate conflict among employees, defuse angry customers, manage competing priorities, handle detail-oriented tasks—or any other quality you value.
Train new managers to excel.
Once you’ve got a great person in place, it can be tempting to cut corners on training. Resist! The new manager will need coaching on expectations, culture, systems—even the industry if it differs from previous jobs.
If you’re hiring from within, teach your new manager all the areas they haven’t yet mastered, such as crafting social media messages, scheduling employees, tracking cash flow, or coming up with daily specials.
Equally important, if an employee is stepping up into a supervisory role, help the entire team adjust to the transition. Express confidence in the person’s ability, offer the right training, and encourage everyone to collaborate.
Remember, especially among younger employees, command-and-control management is dead. That applies to your own leadership and your new manager’s style. Don’t be afraid to give constructive feedback about how they lead, including their ability to build trust and create a positive workplace.
Touch base regularly, but avoid micromanaging.
In small businesses, middle managers are in the trenches juggling day-to-day operations. They need a measure of autonomy to get the job done effectively.
But as the business owner, you need to stay on top of both the big picture and the nitty-gritty details. Be sure to schedule time for regular meetings. Get your manager to give you verbal progress reports. Brainstorm ideas for new offerings and troubleshoot problems together.
Ultimately, the relationship will depend on delegating effectively, communicating regularly, and gaining the confidence to get out of the way and let your manager do her work.
Bringing another person on board can be stressful at first, but the payback will be worth it—in business growth, efficiency, and peace of mind.

news_353,news,David Joseph started a company that is helping restaurant owners sleep at night [Q&A],Q&A with former restaurateur and tech startup founder David Joseph on the hair-pulling frustration of managing sales taxes; the wrong and right way to think about restaurant management; and one thing everyone else in business can learn from what restaurateurs do well.…,07-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/david-joseph-started-a-company-thats-helping-restaurant-owners-sleep-at-night-interview/,"Former restaurateur and current tech company cofounder David Joseph took the adage, “Be the change you want to see in the world,” to its furthest conclusion. The owner of a celebrated restaurant in Montclair, New Jersey that enjoyed an 18-year run before he sold it, Joseph is no stranger to the stress of staying on top of the outflow of cash from a restaurant. When his frustration reached its peak, Joseph decided to do something radical–endeavor to solve the problem for the entire industry.
Clover’s Content Marketing Director, Andaiye Taylor, recently spoke with Joseph about the hair-pulling frustration of managing sales taxes and the company he created to do something about it; the wrong and right way to think about restaurant management; and one thing everyone else in business can learn from what restaurateurs do well.
David Joseph, cofounder of DAVO Technologies
Andaiye Taylor: You’ve told an anecdote about a time when you still had your restaurant when you reached a breaking point with sales taxes. What was that incident?
David Joseph: I remember that incredibly well.
Our bookkeeper came to us and said, “I have your sales tax return. You need to have $9,000 next week.” And I said to her, “Didn’t we just pay sales tax last week?” Because when you’re in a restaurant business, you don’t have notions of time because you’re just so busy all the time.
I walked out of our kitchen and I said to my wife, “Why can’t someone do our sales tax the way ADP does our payroll?”
I knew that the secret was putting sales taxes aside daily. That was the big struggle. You collect a few pennies per sale, but at the end of the month or the end of the quarter, it just becomes thousands of dollars. It’s a cash management issue, but people don’t open restaurants or open businesses to become tax collectors.
From there on, my wife started making all of the managers, at the end of every shift, put the sales tax money into an envelope, mark it with the date and drop it into a safe. She was the only one who had a key to that safe. We did our own daily cash management. The daily putting aside was a solution. And that’s how it all started.
 
Andaiye: Why didn’t someone come up with this sooner?
David: We ask that question all the time. It’s like if this is so obvious, why didn’t someone else do this?
We’ve always known it was really good idea, and it takes grit – you have to believe in what you do to stick with it.
When I said, “Why can’t someone do our sales tax like ADP does our payroll,” that was probably 1999 or 2000.  The only way it would ever be successful is if we got a patent on the process, and so we applied for the patent in 2000, and we got the patent in 2010–10 years. Between 2010 and 2012 we raised money.
It’s been very long process, but we never thought that our idea was bad or that it wouldn’t be successful. It would be successful because there’s a need. And we knew that our solution was the best solution.
 
Andaiye: You were praised for creating a solution to a problem instead of a solution in search of a problem with your technology. Are there other problems, based on your time in the restaurant industry or what your customers are talking about, that you feel DAVO is well-placed to solve? 
David: What we realized after we got our patent and started working with this application is that we’re ultimately a cash management company. We’re money movers.
We’ve taken that concept and we’ve developed other applications with it. We have two new apps now, and these two apps, they do the same thing.
Sweep and Save puts aside a percentage of sales, and on the first of the next month, sends it back to you. If your rent is $600 a month and you’re open every day, you can put aside $20 a day and have $600 in your account on the first of the month. You don’t have to think about it. It’s done for you. Twenty dollars a day is a lot easier than coming up with $600 a month.
Our other app, Savings Club, is a rainy day fund. How many times do restaurants say, “Oh, the air conditioner broke. The refrigerator broke.” So Savings Club, you put aside a little bit of money every day, and there’s a little bit of a rainy day fund there. If you put aside $20 a day, at the end of the year, you’re going to have somewhere around $7,000.
It’s interesting because it’s a thing that people can technically do themselves. But there’s so much else going on that it’s tough to do. It’s the psychology of having to manage so many things–the automation makes a difference.
I often say they don’t call it running a business for no reason. It’s called running a business because you’re not walking, you’re running a small business, and you are running 24/7.
Really good business owners, a lot of times, have a hard time paying themselves, budgeting for a rainy day, and making sure tax gets paid on time. These are things that are the pain points of running a business right, but they’re really important to, and our apps address all of those issues.
 
Andaiye: You guys have a perfect five-star rating on Facebook. People use words like “love” and “blessing” and “rescue” in the reviews to talk about what your technology means to them. 
People have responded in such as visceral way to the service. When you started this company, where you confident that this was the response you were going to get?
David: Absolutely we did. Paying taxes–it’s a personal thing. You’re writing out a check to the state that’s bigger than your paycheck, that’s bigger than rent, that’s bigger than your payroll every month.
As a business, look at this way: I get nothing. I write a check for $9,000, and what did I get for that? I didn’t get more customers. I didn’t buy food. I didn’t make an improvement to my restaurant. I didn’t get the benefit of a bigger paycheck. Nothing. Zero. So it becomes an emotional thing when you’re signing this huge check every month.
That’s why when it’s out of their account, they say “I sleep better at night.” We knew that it was going to be an emotional thing for people. We knew that it was going to take a lot of stress out of their lives.
 
Andaiye: I want to pivot to your restaurant experience. You talk about how paying taxes doesn’t add to the bottom line. You said that’s the reason people should try to get it done as quickly and cheaply as possible. What are some of the things that restaurants should do that add value to their businesses that they don’t generally spend enough time on?
David: I think most people are taught incorrectly about how to run a restaurant.
The general teaching is there are three things you have: food costs, labor costs and overhead. The old equation was, a third, a third, a third, in your restaurant. And that’s the completely wrong way to look at how to run a restaurant.
Chefs and owners need to think like investment bankers. Every time they purchase something, they’re making an investment in something, and that investment needs to make a return.
I look at a restaurant as though it’s run on two numbers: how much you paid for something, and how much you sold it for. How much did we buy this food for? What was the total of all of our receipts that day, and how much did that earn us at the end of the day? Those two numbers determine everything else in the restaurant. It’s going to determine whether you can pay your rent, whether you can pay your payroll, and how much money you’re going to make. As an owner, you have complete control over that every single day.
The problem in the restaurant business is that if you ask most chefs and most owners what their food cost is right now they’ll say, “Last month, it was 34 percent.” Last month? You should be doing that every single day.
The same thing with sales tax. They look at periods of time that are just too long. And once they start thinking about the restaurant in terms of investment in food each day, and what it returns at the end of the day, they actually start homing in and making the restaurants very, very successful.
That ties into Clover. A restaurateur once said to me, “The most expensive seat in a restaurant is the empty one, because it’s costing you. It’s not bringing you money. It costs.” That’s a different way of looking at it, but that’s how you have to look at it.
So how many times in a night can you put somebody into a seat in your restaurant without making your restaurant bigger? How can you turn more tables? This is what Clover Flex is all about. If you can speed that up and at the end of the night gain ten more seats, and each one of those chairs is worth $40, you’ve just made $400 more that night. You didn’t add more seats to your restaurant, you simply found more efficiency for your restaurant.
Restaurateurs don’t think this way because they’re so busy running their restaurants, and then running and running and running. And when you get rid of certain things like sales tax it becomes more efficient, and you have more time to do those things.
 
Andaiye: In terms of specific skills, what’s a skill that you think restaurateurs should work on more?
David: One of the skills that restaurateurs, and business owners in general, need more of is cash management skills–really understanding the flow of money in and money out. They’re very good at getting money in, and Clover helps them do this. There’s loyalty. There’s gift cards. But the outflow of cash, which is where they have to manage that money–most business owners really lack this skill.
It’s very easy to say, “I don’t have money. I’m gonna fix the refrigerator instead. I have a big wedding. I’m gonna put my sales tax off.” And then they get hit with this huge penalty.
 
Andaiye: What is a skill or a set of skills that you think a lot of restaurateurs have in common that they do very well and should feel good about?
David: Something they do really well by virtue of being in this industry: I think restaurateurs are incredibly passionate and proud of their work. It’s demanding, it’s hard, and it’s creative. And it doesn’t matter whether it’s Le Bernardin or your corner bar. I think in general terms, they’re incredibly proud, hard-working businesses.
And I think sometimes they don’t get enough credit for that. It’s a really hard business, but it’s also very rewarding. And it’s a constant challenge.
I hear from people who are in other professions. They say: “I can’t wait to retire. I can’t wait to get out of it.” I don’t think there was ever a day at the restaurant that I regretted being there. It was always interesting, and it was always fun. I think that’s something that small businesses really have in common. Is the love of what they’re doing, and the passion for it. They’re not passionate about sales tax.
 
Andaiye: And speaking of that, have you encountered anyone who started off with the passion and the love for it, and then became disillusioned with it? And have you ever encountered someone who’s gotten to that place and then worked their way back to loving it again? How did they do that?
David: So, I don’t know. I’ve learned a lot about startups and about technology. Companies like I have now are very different than restaurants, but I think there are lots of things that are applicable to it.
First of all, you have to believe wholeheartedly in what you’re doing. There’s a reason for showing up to work every day. And you have to be passionate about it, and you have to stick to it.
We’ve had people come up to us and say, “This is a great idea you guys have. You are turning something on its head, but with a great solution.” There are two guys who want to partner with us to explore other ways of using our process. They’re actually talking with another company about using it as a bill collecting method for them. So it’s interesting. I love showing up for work every day.
 
Andaiye: Have you ever longed to still be in the restaurant industry? Is it something you would do again?
David: I do consulting with restaurants, and I would rather do that than get back into it. I know my wife would probably kill me. A good friend of ours, we keep saying that when we retire we’re going to open a bar and call it Absinthe Minded.
 
Andaiye: I was reading the New York Times review of your restaurant in Montclair (New Jersey), and it was a glowing review. It cited the fact that your dishes were so original, and the one they cited was a dish made of organic field greens and maple balsamic dressing.
I’m curious about how important that type of originality is in the restaurant business versus sticking to the tried and true, and how you came up with these concepts that might seem off the wall, but then became fan favorites.
David: We were way ahead of our time. We were going to farmers’ markets and finding everything that farmers had at the end of the day and trying to source locally. Remember, this is like 1990, and I closed my restaurant 2003. This was way before the current farm-to-table movement.
My mother would say to us “Why would I ever order that at a restaurant? I make that at home.” That always stuck with me. We were always trying to stay ahead of everybody else and what you could find in the supermarket. I remember the maple balsamic dressing recipe – actually we’d seen it somewhere, I think up in Vermont at some restaurant. I was like, “This sounds actually really good,” and we created our own recipe for it. I still make it today.
 
Andaiye: What were you most naive about when you started your restaurant?
David: The restaurant kind of started out of ignorance. I was not trained in the restaurant business. I actually started a catering company prior to starting a restaurant. The space that we ended up in had a kitchen with a front retail space, and the retail space never did well. I thought, “We could do a lot better if it was a restaurant.”
And that was kind of how it started. I hired a couple of chefs, and one day one of our chefs didn’t show up and I thought, “I’ve been watching him. This is not rocket science. This is basic organization and cooking and learning skills.” I essentially taught myself about running a kitchen and cooking, and it grew from there.
We built the reputation around using the best quality ingredients. We sourced from really good people, and we just tried not to screw it up.
 
Andaiye: What do you wish you had known at the outset that you had to learn the hard way?
David: You pay sales tax on time. (laughs) That was a big one that cost us tens of thousands of dollars in penalties.
I think at the beginning, a lot of it was learning as we went. Successful businesses are constantly reassessing, and changing, and adapting, and becoming more efficient. And those who don’t do that will not survive.
You have to be constantly self-critical of yourself and of your business, and improving every day. That, I think, is a really important lesson. I cook better now than I did when I closed my restaurant in 2003. Why is that? Because you’re constantly looking at what did you do: what could I have done to make it better? That’s one part of it.
The other part is–I’m famous for saying this around our office–if I’m the smartest person in the room, I’m in the wrong room. You have to surround yourself with people who have better skills than you in certain areas, and you have to be ready and willing to admit that. It’s very hard for a lot of people in restaurants. There are a lot of really big egos in restaurants. You need to be confident in your own skills, but also hire people who are better at things than you.
 
Andaiye: Tactical question, back to DAVO itself. How does your team stay on top of all of the tax laws in all of all the different states?
David: Great question, and honestly, we don’t. Here’s the reason: our terms and conditions are actually quite clear that it’s a merchant’s responsibility to supply us with the correct data. It is their responsibility to make sure that their Clover is programmed correctly.
When someone calls us up and says, “What’s the tax rate in my jurisdiction?” we will never give them a tax rate. What we advise them to do is to call their State Department of Revenue and ask them. We don’t even we tell them to search for it online. We have a list of all the numbers for the states on our website.
 
Andaiye: In one of your previous interviews, you said that the tech for DAVO had to catch up to you guys’ idea. What was the capability that had to develop before you were able to actually complete the technology and bring it to market?
David: Remember, we applied for a patent in 2000 and we got it in 2010. For our application to work we need data. The old cash registers did not have connectivity, and there was no way for us to get data. The cloud is what enabled that.
 
Andaiye: Lastly, how did your integration with Clover come to be?
David: We were at the RFPA conference, which is essentially the cash register conference every year in Las Vegas. The first day we walk into the exhibit right outside. There was a display setup, and there was Mark Schulze and John Beatty. They were showing Clover, and they started telling us what they were doing, that they were creating, essentially, a cash register with an app marketplace like your phone.
They said, “What do you guys do?” And we’re like, “Oh, we got this little sales tax product.” They said, “That would be a great app. We want you to integrate.”
So we did the whole integration. We bought one of the very first Clover units, before the new Clover Station even came out. A really good friend had a bed and breakfast with a restaurant. We put it in there and we beta tested it. And that was the beginning of Clover for us. We were getting data from it. It was working. From there, we did the integration and the rest is history.

news_355,news,Enterprise behavior: Getting employee perks right,"While a small business owner can’t splurge on lavish offerings like all-inclusive vacations or an in-house chef, it’s important to think of creative, low-cost perks to keep your employees motivated. Here are a few ideas to get you started.…",09-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-getting-employee-perks-right/,"When it comes to employee benefits, it’s tough for a small merchant to compete with big companies.
A small business owner can’t splurge on lavish offerings like all-inclusive vacations or an in-house chef, but it’s still important to think of creative, low-cost perks to keep your employees motivated. After all, job seekers take into account the whole package, not just the salary. Intentionally baking in benefits that that make their lives better sets a merchant apart from the competition and can lead to productive, loyal and happy workers.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
Stock the office pantry.
Something as simple as having tea, coffee and a few of your employees’ favorite snacks always on hand can go a long way in making the work day more pleasurable. If you can do a little more, employees might enjoy carbonated beverage dispensers, options for their coffee consumption (cold brew, aeropress, etc.), or even some beers to enjoy at the end of the work day.
Surprise them with treats.
Bringing in goodies like bagels, donuts, or cupcakes breaks up the workday and adds a splash of excitement to everyone’s day. It’s an affordable, easy way to boost morale and put a smile on everyone’s face. Plus, if you regularly put out coffee and donuts early in the morning, it encourages people to show up early. And for those working late, reward them with dinner from a local eatery.
Offer freebies.
Who doesn’t like free stuff? Make it a habit to reward your employees with small tokens of appreciation, such as tickets to concerts, movies or events. If your company credit card is racking up points, pass those perks along to your workers.
Give local business discounts.
Partner with a neighboring merchant to offer discounts to each other’s employees. For example, if your team likes to hit a nearby bar for happy hour, strike a mutual discount deal with that owner. Now your employees have a place to mingle and build team rapport, all while enjoying discounted drinks. Find out which local outlets your team likes—it might be a gym, a salon, or a restaurant—and cater to their interests.
Allow for flexible work arrangements.
There are so many ways to communicate to workers that their work/life balance matters. Relax the dress code. Offer telecommuting options. Allow for flexible hours. Celebrate summer by allowing workers to leave early on Friday. When employees feel content with the balance in their lives, their more likely to be productive at work. If you hire millennials, take note that they are far less loyal and place work/life balance at the top of their priority list.
Plan in-office happy hours.
Treating the whole team to a few rounds at a bar can add up quick. But you can offer the same quality of drinks if you bring your own bar to work. Celebrate the team with an in-office happy hour, complete with beer, signature cocktails, snacks, and music.
Provide professional development opportunities.
It may be out of reach to reimburse employees for school, but investing in their development is crucial for letting them know that you see their value. Affordable options include creating a mentorship program between newer employees and those who have been in the business longer. You can also offer them a few paid hours a week to take an online class. Or hire an expert in the field to come in for an afternoon seminar.
Give store discounts.
Encourage your employees to shop with you. Even small discounts can go a long way.
Reward referrals.
If you’re looking to attract and retain great talent, reward employees who refer their friends to work with you. The same goes for building your customer base. Get your workers excited about attracting new customers by rewarding their outreach efforts.
Arrange a pleasant employee lounge.
Carve out a spot for a few comfy chairs and warm lighting so your staff has a designated area to take breaks, unwind, and catch up with colleagues.
Keep your staff’s interests in mind.
Above all, choose benefits that specifically meet the needs of your people. Hire a lot of students? Consider offering a cash bonus towards textbook purchases if employees stick with their job for a certain period. Do a lot of your staff have kids? Flexible hours can help them make their school pick up and drop off experience less hectic. And of course, re-evaluate with time as the lifestyles and needs of your people will change.

And on social media, complaints can spin into a windstorm of bad reviews fast. 
But how can merchants prevent a complaint from spiraling out of control—especially when it could mean losing customers? How can businesses turn a bad situation around even when it’s their mess-up? A Milwaukee business recently had that opportunity when an NBA All-Star player, fresh off of a playoff game where he put down the game-winning shot, walked through its doors.

Worth at least a few tacos.

Scenario
It was a Sunday afternoon in Milwaukee, around 5 p.m. The Milwaukee Bucks had just tied the series with Boston Celtics at 2-2, thanks to Giannis Antetokounmpo. Milwaukee fans celebrated. Some dined out, and some diners at BelAir Cantina spotted the Bucks’ hero waiting for a table. And waiting…and waiting.
After about 10 minutes with no table and no word from staff, Giannis left the restaurant. Did a Milwaukee restaurant really just snub their hometown game-winner? How could they not find a table for the celebrated athlete who had just thrown the game-winning shot?

i would’ve given up my seat at Bel Air Cantina with the quickness for Giannis Antetokounmpo… he is a Milwaukee hero and legend. smh that he wasn’t able to get a table after one of the biggest wins of his career.. for shame!
— TOMMY VERSETTi (@iamjeffbernier) April 23, 2018

That incident had the makings of a social mess for BelAir Cantina. That is, until they took control of the narrative, posted a message on Facebook, and began to turn the conversation around.
What They Did Right
When it comes to handling customer complaints, thoughtfulness matters. Recently, we offered 5 questions to ask yourself when a customer complains. A merchant’s response to a customer’s complaint can make or break the relationship with that customer—and maybe others. While no response is perfect and no outcome guaranteed, BelAir Cantina did five things that spring Sunday that transformed a bad situation into an opportunity.
1. Listen to feedback, take it seriously, and act promptly.
It would have been easy to dismiss the complaints about not seating a local sports hero fast enough as mere noise. Not BelAir Cantina. They paid attention to the feedback, took time to understand the issues, and offered a timely response and solution. Within two hours, they posted a response on their Facebook page.
2. Apologize simply.
If you or your team mess up, admit it, and apologize simply. BelAir Cantina’s management took ownership of the incident and offered a simple apology: “We are very sorry we weren’t able to seat Giannis Antetokounmpo in as timely of a manner as we would have hoped.”
3. Resist the urge to over-explain, place blame, or make excuses.
When addressing a complaint, too much information and too many details can seem insincere or like you’re passing the buck. Instead, explain briefly and positively. The BelAir Cantina team did just that. They articulated the context for the incident concisely and thoughtfully: “The Milwaukee Bucks big win, thanks to [Giannis’] tip in and the team’s great play, combined with today’s spring weather had people turn out in droves to celebrate and we had quite a wait. We were honored he came in for a celebratory meal, and wish we could have accommodated him right away.”
4. Offer a solution that extends beyond the scope of the incident.

Complaints have a way of multiplying—especially on social media. One customer incident can have a cascading impact on other customers and prospects. Be willing to offer a solution that extends past a single incident, reaches others customers, and delights everyone.
BelAir Cantina proposed a solution that benefitted Giannis, Bucks supporters, and patrons of all their restaurants: “We welcome [Giannis] back Thursday after another Bucks win and will hold open a table. And to turn this into a positive for everyone, we are pledging that if the Bucks win the series Thursday night in Milwaukee, we will provide all Bucks fans with a free taco with any purchase all day Friday at all our locations! #GoBucks #BucksIn6”

5. Use the power of social media.
Negative feedback on social media, even if based on perceptions, can have real and broad impacts on your customer base. BelAir Cantina understood the power of social media as a customer service tool and used it. Leveraging social media to address customer problems can be tricky, so we’ve offered a few tips for what to do and not to do in social media.  
Could BelAir Cantina have handled the incident better? Sure. Preventing a problem is better than addressing it after the fact. Although their seating stumble caused an outcry, BelAir Cantina’s customer listening and timely response helped them regain control of the narrative. An initial misstep need not be fatal, but it does have to be addressed swiftly and intelligently with a solution that satisfies the customer’s issue and demonstrates a crystal-clear commitment to service.
Offering outstanding customer experiences is an investment of time, attention, and intelligence, but it can pay dividends throughout the life of a business in customer loyalty. Peruse 6 ideas for creating standout customer service.

news_357,news,New & notable in the Clover App Market: May 2018,"Apptizer, CoinOut, and Scratch Card Wali give your business more ways to use your Clover device to engage your customers and keep yourself ahead of the competition.…",15-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-in-the-clover-app-market-may-2018/,"Small business owners are always looking for ways to get a leg up on the competition. One of the best ways to do that is to stand out with unique offerings and innovative solutions. And that’s where this month’s New & Notable comes in to play. The three apps in this month’s spotlight are designed to help you get the most out of your Clover POS system so you can get paid, sell more, and run your business better.
Apptizer
Meet the app your business can really sink its teeth into. Apptizer makes it easy to create your own branded order-ahead app that’s unique to your store. All it takes is a few clicks and you can help people order ahead from your restaurant and pick up their order when they please. And because it seamlessly integrates with Clover, you can view and accept all mobile orders right on your Clover device.
Apptizer also lets you engage directly with customers through push notifications, increasing your sales by up to 30%. Best of all, you simply pay a flat fee per month, not per order, to use it. So, the more it’s used, the more value you’ll receive.
CoinOut
Get ready for a big change! CoinOut is not a new app, but it was just featured on Shark Tank. This app lets customers create an online bank for their change right on their phone. Instead of carrying loose change in their pockets, CoinOut has them carry it on their phones and use it anywhere that has the CoinOut app.
Featuring a 0% processing fee for merchants AND customers, and $50 in CoinOut credits to cover debits/credits for new merchants, CoinOut makes it easy to get started. You can also send direct messages to CoinOut users, tapping the marketing potential of the app to help you build relationships with your customers.
Scratch Card Wali
Sometimes, it’s the little things that make the biggest difference. Scratch Card Wali offers up a virtual “scratch” card that appears when customers pay that’s a great way to treat guests to a pleasant surprise at checkout. You can customize the available rewards to be as big or as little as you’d like. The app even helps you record which order got the lucky scratch card too, so you don’t have to.
Even though it feels like playing a game, no special printers or devices needed. Everything happens right on the screen of your Clover. Scratch Card Wali also lets you offer specific coupons or vouchers to encourage repeat visits.
With Clover (and the Clover App Market) in your corner, you have more ways to engage your customers and keep yourself ahead of the competition.

news_359,news,Business trends & research roundup: Wage strategy for hourly employees,"What does the research say about paying hourly employees? Check out our monthly roundup of research that will help you make your business better.
…",17-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-trends-research-roundup-wage-strategy-for-hourly-employees/,"What does the research say about paying hourly employees? Check out our monthly roundup of research that will help you make your business better.
Higher wages attract and retain talent.

61 percent of job seekers say pay was the top factor they considered when deciding on a job, according to the Jobvite Job Seeker Nation 2015 survey. Other benefits like vacation and work/life balance mattered, but pay mattered first and foremost.
Jobvite’s 2018 survey found that compensation was the top factor for leaving a job for about one in five job seekers.
It seems like a no-brainer that paying workers fairly helps keep talent, but small and medium-sized businesses are notorious for having a gender-pay gap far worse than the national average. The gap is 34 percent, or 18 percent less than the national average, according to a 2018 study from Zenefits. This not only hurts productivity, it can lead to loss of valuable workers.
Raising wages is a strategic move to help prevent turnover. Losing an employee costs a business tremendously. Studies estimate that sometimes the cost can reach as high as 2 times the employee’s annual salary, according to Bersin by Deloitte. After all, when you lose an a worker, there’s a ripple effect across the business. Other employees take note, which can lead to employee disengagement, a dip in productivity, and poorer customer service. The process of hiring a new employee costs money in advertising, interviewing, hiring, and training. A new hire needs time to learn and is prone to make mistakes, leading to further costs to the business.

Better pay boosts morale.

When your employees are happy, your business will run better. It’s why some bosses go the extra mile to offer perks like flexible hours and programs to improve work-life balance. But these aren’t addressing the top stressor of most people—money. Nearly three in four people say they feel stressed about money some of the time and nearly one in four people say they feel extreme stress about money, according to a 2015 report by the American Psychological Association.
If you can alleviate the financial stress of your employees, you free up their minds to focus on doing their best work on the job.
Additionally, some research suggests that higher pay leads to higher productivity among workers. Even if a business shells out more cash, they’re rewarded with more production, innovative process, and other benefits to the business, according a report by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Well-paid workers lead to better-served, repeat customers.

For a lot of merchants, hourly workers are the face of the company. Baristas, waiters, receptionists, and sales clerks all serve on the frontline of customer service. Satisfied employees tend to have positive interactions with customers, resulting in an overall boost to the brand and business.
If you’re worried that higher wages will lead to higher prices and will turn customers away, that’s not always the case. In fact, 71 percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage for workers, even if it means paying more when eating out, according to a recent poll conducted by the National Restaurant Association.

Be sure to consider your business’ particular position.

Of course, deciding to raise wages or not is entirely dependent on what your business can afford. Do the math. Look at your revenue and look at all of your costs. If there’s no room to raise wages, consider ways to improve your margins that would allow for even a minor pay bump. Maybe you need to raise prices or reduce costs. If certain products sit on the shelf for too long, or underperform in sales, consider replacing them with higher-margin, faster-moving products.
Weigh the productivity gains of paying more against the cost of doing that. Ultimately, you have a business to run and margins to protect.

…",24-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/the-benefits-of-pos-systems-for-quick-serve-restaurants-qsr/,"Life in a restaurant moves fast—serving customers, balancing call-ins and take outs while juggling inventory, employees, and more. That’s why you need a point-of-sale (POS) device that can keep up with the demands of your QSR’s day-to-day operations while giving you the flexibility to change things as needed. This blog will take a look at some of the benefits of modern POS systems compared to their predecessors.
First, let’s be clear about the alternatives: if you’re trying to stay “old school” with a payment processing terminal (or, worse yet, a bare-bones cash register), just know you’re doing yourself, your customers, and your business a great disservice. Why waste your time and effort on machines that sell you short with capabilities that are stuck in the year 2000? Think about it: no apps, no mobile capabilities, and no way to accept EMV and chip cards. Certainly there is no way to swiftly analyze the transaction data you generate every day. When you consider those factors, any money you think you’re saving by not upgrading your POS is actually being lost several times over in missed productivity and transaction revenue.
Now, let’s share a quick word on competing POS systems. There are a growing number of modern POS systems that claim to help you do more beyond accepting payments.

In 2008, Apple unveiled its App Store. Hailed “Apple’s biggest innovation” for the year, what made the App Store such a game-changer was that it converted the smartphone—which by then was already a hub of people’s daily experiences and activities—into a device capable of managing even more of people’s daily lives.
Marketplaces for business-focused apps, like the Clover App Market, hold much the same promise for small businesses. Here’s why.
1. App marketplaces let a lot of smart people create handy tools for users
One reason the App Store was deemed so revolutionary when it was announced was because it let independent developers, and not just Apple’s in-house developers, create apps for the devices. By inviting non-Apple developers into the fold, the company greatly increased the likelihood that the apps it offered through its store could make users’ lives a little more efficient, convenient, and fun. For evidence, look no further than the fact that the store now boasts more than 2 million apps (with an additional 2.2 million apps available in Google Play), more than Apple could ever hope to, or would ever want to, create on its own.
At the same time, they protected consumers by maintaining standards and being serious about quality control, so that opening up the floodgates to independent app developers’ ingenuity didn’t mean they would drown their users in security problems.
How this principle helps businesses. Likewise, no single company, no matter how long they’ve been creating technologies for small business, has the monopoly on ideas for apps that can make merchants even smarter about their businesses, or make running one a little bit easier.
The Clover App Market, for example, boasts tools that can do everything from save merchants the headache of managing coins (CoinOut) to intelligently managing restaurant waitlists (Clavo Waitlist). Every business, and every business manager, is a little bit different. A marketplace open to independent development increases the chances that market can offer tools that adapt to as many businesses’ needs as possible.
2. App marketplaces are connected to devices already used by legions
While an app marketplace is a great way to multiply innovation, it wouldn’t be as useful on a handheld calculator as it would on a smartphone. It would be possible for a calculator manufacturer to let independent developers create apps that make calculators more useful. But relative to smartphones, handheld calculators are used by scant few people, and when they are, they perform a relatively narrow set of tasks. An app marketplace for calculators just isn’t a high-impact proposition.
Now consider the smartphone. For millions of people, it’s akin to a bodily appendage. It also happens to be a calculator—and a communication device, a calendar, a camera, and a mini-computer. And that’s without the independently developed apps. Building apps on top of devices consumers are already using frequently, intensely and in high numbers makes sense as a matter of convenience for users. It also enhances those devices in ways that build on top of their existing capabilities.
How this principle helps businesses. In terms of its ubiquity, a point-of-sale system is to merchants what a smartphone is to consumers. As the place where transactions happen, it’s the technological beating heart of a business’s operation. So it only makes sense that independent apps latch onto businesses’ point-of-sale systems: they’re already using them, and the systems are at the center of their operations.
3. Apps can enhance each other when they’re connected to a hub
Smartphone apps aren’t limited to using the technologies and information built into the core device itself. They can also “talk” to each other in ways that multiply their usefulness.
Consider health apps that can incorporate information from sleep apps, workout apps, meal trackers and heart rate monitors to give you a comprehensive view of your health, and help you make sense of how your habits in each of these areas affect the others. This offers you insights into your health without requiring you to do a lot of active tracking and data entry. These types of integrated app experiences can make you smarter not only about the state of your health—they can give you the information you need to actually alter your activities, and to do so in an informed way.
How this principle helps businesses. Similarly, separate business apps can talk to each other and multiply the information merchants have about their business, and make them smarter about how to tackle the many jobs required to make their business run. How might you need to think about scheduling to handle an uptick in traffic because of your new promotion? How might the particulars of your loyalty program affect stocking decisions? When the apps that help small businesses manage separate tasks are built on the same system, those businesses have an opportunity to better understand those correlations and, eventually, to get help automating them.

news_362,news,Business accelerators: Negotiating a better deal from your suppliers,"One of the best ways to boost profitability is to cut the cost of goods. Find out how to negotiate with suppliers to get great deals, while strengthening the relationship for the long haul.
…",30-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-negotiating-a-better-deal-from-your-suppliers/,"Are you barely breaking even? It’s time to set your sights higher.
To boost the bottom line, small businesses can use several tactics. They can raise their prices, increase their volume, or lower their costs. Let’s look at the last strategy as it holds so much promise.
In a crisis situation, employers might slash expenditures by letting staff go or moving to a cheaper location. But that can also wreck the business. To get ongoing cost savings and profit bumps, your suppliers can help.
This post explores how to negotiate a better deal with vendors, while simultaneously strengthening relationships.
Treat suppliers like partners.
For small businesses, relationships mean everything. Customers, employees, investors—strong relationships move the business forward.
The same is true for suppliers. Not only do they have their own costs, expenditures, and financial goals. They also build their businesses by focusing on customers, which is you. Keep these common goals in mind as you enter negotiations.
Show them the numbers.
When small businesses and their suppliers work as partners, not adversaries, they share information. Both parties open their books, communicate needs, and collaborate to find the best solutions.

Prove your value. Before meeting face to face, gather key data to guide the discussion. Figure out how much you spend each year with the supplier. Is it a significant sum? Are some items moving so quickly you need to increase orders? What about plans to expand in the future—will that affect volume?
Find the sweet spot. Next, show them your profit margins on specific items. Clover Insights gives you a quick overview of each item’s costs, sales, and profitability. Ask to see how much the supplier spends to make and deliver products. Is there a middle ground where you can both share the profits?
Compare prices. Don’t forget another piece of essential data: competitor prices. Get a price list from other suppliers, or ask fellow merchants what they’re spending on similar or identical supplies. How do the prices compare? Does your vendor offset higher prices with superior quality and service? Should they?

With hard data in hand, business owners and suppliers can negotiate with eyes wide open.
Find ways to benefit both parties.
Small business owners get used to making decisions and directing the action. But that doesn’t always play well when you’re dealing with suppliers, particularly if they have lots of customers. Some suppliers prefer to lose a few customers rather than drop prices. So how can you negotiate from a position of power?

Be reliable. To improve your position, remind them that you’re easy to work with. For example, if you pay bills promptly, you save vendors time and hassle. Or, you might offer to pay large deposits on orders up front. Both tactics can increase your bargaining power.
Search for efficiencies. Another possibility is to find ways to streamline the ordering and delivery process. What can you do to align with a vendor’s schedule? Better systems translate into lower costs, which they can pass along to you.
Go beyond cost. If it’s a big-ticket item and the supplier won’t budge on price, consider negotiating the size of the down payment or the length of the warranty. Be creative in finding ways to cut your costs and risks.
Lock in discounts. If competitors’ prices are lower, point out the discrepancy. Can they match the rates or ramp up services? Is there a volume discount they might offer, especially if you can show that sales are trending up? Can you consolidate orders and funnel more business to one supplier in return for better rates?

Sure, you pay the supplier, but they’re often the bigger player. Try to work together to find mutually beneficial solutions.
Think long term.
Small businesses depend on strong relationships. These bonds are built on trust— trust that you’ll deliver great products and services, at a price that customers are willing to pay.
Extend that trust to suppliers. By working closely with vendors and forging ongoing relationships based on honesty and transparency, small business owners create reliable partners.
The supply chain isn’t some impersonal entity. It’s an essential link to holding down costs, improving quality, and achieving greater profits.

news_363,news,5 growth hacks to increase profits at your quick service restaurant,"Whether you’re in the business of slicing pizza, scooping ice cream, serving fresh ingredients, or all of the above, boosting profitability can come from some small or significant changes. This curated guide delivers fresh new ideas for increasing your QSR’s profitability. 
…",31-05-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-growth-hacks-to-increase-profits-at-your-quick-service-restaurant/,"Looking for some immediate changes you can make to increase profits at your quick service restaurant?
Growing your restaurant’s sales is only half the equation. In the highly competitive restaurant industry, margins are slim—meaning small businesses may need to get creative to make more money. With a little strategy, quick service and fast casual restaurants can benefit from growth hacks to lower costs and increase sales. Whether you’re a pizza restaurant, coffee shop, ice cream parlor, or burger joint, these growth hacks are for you.
We’ve compiled advice from the best of the best to help your QSR conquer the food service industry.
1. Use a loyalty program to increase sales.
Some studies have shown that a loyalty program can increase sales by up to 20%—a huge number for the restaurant industry. If you’re looking for a way to increase profit, rewards and loyalty programs are a great place to start.
If you are not sure if a rewards program is right for your QSR, consider this. After Starbucks began their rewards program, revenue has increased to $2.65 billion—with 22% of all sales in the US driven by their loyalty rewards app.

2. Plan your menu and seasonal promos strategically.
Not all your products are going to sell out each week. However, some products almost never move, and these could be costing you money in the long-run. Start to eliminate low-selling items from your menu. Then, plan your menu and seasonal promos around high-value items.

3. Encourage foot traffic during lulls.
Every restaurant has a few periods during the day and week when foot-traffic is low. The lull between lunch and dinner, or weeknights compared to weekends can be tough times for some QSRs.
Rather than seeing these hours as dead time, consider offering a discount or promo to encourage new sales. Some sales are better than no sales, and by offering 10% off or a 2-for-1 special, you can usually increase profitability.

4. Make your POS work for you.
Quick service restaurants can boost their profitability by adding a POS system to your toolkit. Use them to prompt employees to upsell to customers, track sales, create more efficient staffing schedules, promote specials, surface insights on your best selling items, and house your loyalty program.
Save time with integrated POS apps. These tools automate some of the routine parts of your business to help you run a tight ship.

Commerce Sync eliminates manual data entry. It automatically syncs daily sales on your Clover POS with accounting software like Xero and Quickbooks. This saves customers an average 300 hours per year.
SimpleOrder is a real-time inventory management system that helps you quickly identify low performing items that might be replaced with new offerings and keep your shelves stocked.
Homebase is an employee scheduling tool that reduces the time it takes to schedule hourly employees and update their payroll. It saves customers an average of 65 working days a year.

5. Reduce shrinkage in your restaurant.
An ice cream scoop here, an extra shift meal there may not seem like a lot, but it all adds up. Shrinkage is the term for when things seem to wander off: stealing, by shoppers, customers, or your own staff. Shrinkage was responsible for $49 billion in losses in 2016.

news_364,news,Business accelerators: Upselling techniques that work,"Upselling can be a very powerful way to increase sales…when done right. Here are four upselling techniques that drive sales without feeling pushy.
…",05-06-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-upselling-techniques-that-work/,"Upselling is a sales technique where customers are encouraged to upgrade their purchase or buy additional items. As a growth strategy it can be a very powerful way to increase sales, yet upselling has to be done carefully so the salesperson doesn’t turn off a customer. Research indicates that only about 15% of customers are receptive to hearing additional offers when they are making a purchase. Yet consumers are often interested in hearing exceptional promotions and appreciate a consultative selling approach where the salesperson helps them solve a problem.
Here are few upselling techniques to integrate into your customer experience:
Complete the purchase.
One easy way to integrate upselling into your sales checkout process is to look for obvious add-ons that complete a purchase. The key to making this work is to make sure the offer is relevant to what they need. For example, if they ask for a gift receipt, it makes sense to ask if they are interested in getting a greeting card or gift bag. If they are buying a toy as a gift, batteries are a relevant add-on. Similarly, if the purchase is very unique, offer any relevant specialized equipment—an exotic fish that requires special food or a particular type of tank, or a new device that has a special charger sold separately.
Be casual, not canned.
Many customers are sensitive to upselling techniques and shut down when you try to introduce new products. To sell more without annoying customers, you have to use a counterintuitive approach…be less “salesy”. Read the body language to make sure customers are receptive and try a less pushy, aggressive approach. For example, instead of asking, “Do you need a belt with this?” consider mentioning, casually, “I saw a customer pair this dress with one of our new belts. It looked awesome.” If the customer responds positively, point out where in the store they can find it, but don’t follow them over there unless they indicate they need or want help. Give them a chance to explore the merchandise without feeling chased by a salesperson. The trick here is to suggest ideas, but to have an authentic conversation, not a canned script.
Here are some other casual upselling examples:

A lot of people are buying this together with…
This color is all the new rage. This and the new top style over there…everyone seems to want one.
I don’t know if I mentioned this before, but we now do estate planning in addition to taxes.
I just got my nails done by our new manicurist….isn’t this cute?
Oh, I had that dish with the Merlot earlier—they were perfect together.

Solve a problem.
Often during the selling process customers will reveal details that are important in both closing the sale and selling more to this customer. For example, if the customer reveals they have a food allergy, it wouldn’t make sense to try to sell that customer items they are allergic to. If the customer mentions they are trying to find just the right outfit for a date after work it’s both relevant and appropriate to mention styles that work for both. Crucial to this type of sale is letting the customer know that you are not blindly putting products in front of them, but rather trying to answer questions they raised. With this technique it helps to ask questions and relate back to them what you heard. For example, “So you need something for work that also looks good on a date…what kind of work environment are you in? Are you allowed to wear sleeveless tops, maybe under a jacket?” Details let the customer know you are listening and they become more receptive to your suggestions.

Are you interested in desert? I noticed you ordered gluten-free, we have a flourless chocolate cake that’s divine.

A variation of problem-solving is to have customers self-sell into an upgrade. This approach is more informational with no pushy or aggressive language. So, for example, if someone chooses a service plan that is basic, and you offer 4 more expensive plans, the upsell would be to pull up a chart of all the plans outlining what’s included. You would say something non-salesy like, “So to verify, you’d like plan X that includes these features, right? You’re not interested in these features?” and place the chart in front of them. Because you’re simply verifying their purchase it doesn’t feel pushy, and yet the customer is made aware of all the plans. If your pricing plan offers significant value for the additional price, the customer is likely to choose an upgrade all on their own. Asking questions is a good way to kick off this type of selling. Here are some examples:

Would you like the regular polish or do you want the gel? The Gel Manicure is for people who need the manicure to last up to 14 days.
Do you want the hair color to be permanent, or do you just need it to last for a few washes?
What will you be using the tent for? Because this model is very sturdy and can be used during colder weather, whereas this tent was designed just for summer use. If you think you’re going to use it more than once, or possibly later in the season, the sturdier option is a better choice.
Are you looking for a basic chocolate cake, or do you want it to look like it was made especially for the person you’re celebrating?

Offer more value.
If you offer what’s perceived as exceptional value for just a little more money, people will be far more likely to buy. Coffee shops, for example, will often bundle a Danish or other breakfast treat with coffee at a reduced price. This additional value for buying more is a great way to upsell customers. Start with your best-selling products and consider what might pair well with it. Then come up with a promotional “bundle” price. Then you can simply advertise the promotion and ask at the register, “Do you want to get a donut for just $0.50 more?”
Success when trying to upsell customers comes down to this: What’s in it for them? If it’s a really attractive offer or is, genuinely, the better choice to solve their problems, they will love you for suggesting it. If it feels like an impersonal upsell into something that is not relevant to them, they will be turned off.

news_365,news,How (and why) your business can go cashless,"Nearly 40% of Americans prefer to go cash-free, a global trend that’s on the rise for businesses around the world. Going cashless can save small merchants time, money, and lead to increased sales and a better checkout experience. So: how can your business go cashless?
…",06-06-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-and-why-your-business-can-go-cashless/,"“Cash is king,” as the cliche goes. Unfortunately, cash is starting to go the way of floppy-discs, flip phones, and MySpace.
As a nation, the US is the fifth “most cashless country” in the world, following Canada, Sweden, the UK, and France. Some studies report that nearly 40% of Americans prefer to go completely cash-free. Small businesses are starting to go take note, led by several prominent fast-casual establishments (see: Dos Toros, sweetgreen, Maison Keyser, and Argos Tea). In doing so, small merchants are saving time, reducing costs, and increasing sales.
If cash is king, it may be time to overthrow the monarchy. Here’s how your business can benefit from going cashless, how to set up a cashless system, and the steps a business can take to make the transition seamless.
Why Should You Go Cashless?
Going cashless has several benefits, including a faster checkout process, easier accounting and bookkeeping, reduced theft (or “shrinkage”), higher sales and the ability to set up recurring payments, and curb appeal for younger customers. Overall, you’ll see a combination of cost savings on things like overhead, time, and employee training matched by revenue-increasing benefits like faster checkout and customer service.
If the thought of ceasing to accept cash fills you with apprehension, consider these stats and examples from the UK and Canada, two of the more cashless countries than the US.

70% of Canadians who use their smartphones to pay say “convenience” was their primary motivation (versus using other payment methods).
Canadian customers are spending, on average, 12% to 18% more when they use credit instead of cash.
London’s transit system saved over £30 million a year just by going cashless.
One major UK restaurant chain saw turnover increase by 13.6%, increasing revenue by £10 million in one year.

Small businesses are saving on the costs it takes to process and reconcile cash, while at the same time seeing faster sales turnover and higher check totals. It’s a win-win.
How to Transition to No-Cash
The first step toward transitioning from cash to alternate payments only is to determine what percentage of your transactions are already non-cash. If you have a Clover dashboard, check this easily by taking a look at the Transactions app. Then, you should size up your VIP customers and their preferred buying patterns with the Customers app. This gives you good insight into whether cashless is a good option for your unique business.
If you’re not sure whether cashless is right for you, try the Coinout app. Coinout allows customers to keep change in an online account to reduce loose coins in their pocket. It also encourages customers to donate their change to charity or the tip jar. It can be a nice baby-step towards going cashless or a good compromise while you get your system up and running.
Next, determine what your non-cash system is going to look like. There is an (over)abundance of non-cash payment options your customers may try to use: credit, debit, checks, plastic gift cards, mobile gift cards, NFC/mobile pay, and more. Clover devices support a range of payment options: even the Clover Go can accept chip, dip, or NFC payments, unlike some competitors.
A big barrier to entry that gives many small businesses pause is the transaction fees that come with credit card processors. The statistics show that Americans use cash for around 14% of their everyday purchases, while 80% use a debit or credit card. It’s probably inevitable that you already accept some kind of non-cash payment: now, by going fully-cashless, your system will be better equipped to process sales no matter what the payment method.
Cashless + Customer Service
One final piece to the puzzle? Communicating your business’s no-cash policy. Certainly, you don’t want to miss out on a sale while making the transition to cashless. Here’s how to make the transition easy for your customers—and your staff.

Start communicating the change sooner, rather than later. Give plenty of warning before making the switch!
Don’t insist on a minimum credit order amount. Flexibility is key.
Empower your staff to provide awesome customer service. Dig Inn, another fast-casual cashless restaurant, lets employees give a customer here and there a free meal when they don’t have an accepted payment method.
Pick a system that evolves with the payment methods. Clover and other POS systems are constantly working on technology that will accept any payment method that walks through the door—so keep your training for employees up to date.
Have a contingency plan. Sometimes (mostly on Mondays, it seems) things can go wrong. The wifi might be down, or a card reader is on the fritz. Have a backup plan so you can still accept payment should the worst happen.

Cashless is the way of the future. Don’t get stuck in the dark ages! Start exploring your options to start saving time, money, and headaches.

news_366,news,"Business scenario: Your loyalty program works, but it’s costing you too much","Rewarding your loyal customers is important: but not at the cost to your bottom line. Check to see if your rewards program is working the way you should, and if it isn’t, take these steps to course correct. …",07-06-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-your-loyalty-program-works-but-its-costing-you-too-much/,"Have you checked on your loyalty program lately?
While the time for spring cleaning may have passed—hello, summer!—one part of a business’s operations that frequently flies under the radar is a loyalty program. If you have one installed, now is the time to crunch some numbers and make sure that it’s working the way it should.
Why? Because there have been a few high-profile companies that recently made some “tweaks” to their loyalty programs. It’s easy to assume that a program is working when in reality, it’s draining your cash. Starbucks shifted their program from a system based solely on the number of visits to a system based on how much is spent. Alaska Airlines and American Airlines ended their points partnership after realizing it wasn’t beneficial. And, after announcing their acquisition by Amazon, Whole Foods pulled their rewards program until further notice.
Completely ending a rewards program can cause your customers to turn on you. It’s important to reward your customers’ loyalty. In the restaurant industry, a loyalty program can increase sales by up to 20%, making it well worth your time to get the loyalty rewards right. If you find your program is draining money, try to make an adjustment, rather than cancelling rewards altogether. Here are some ways to change course should you discover your loyalty program is costing too much.
Use a “membership” model.
If you’re already making it rain rewards, one way to pivot is to introduce a tiered, membership-style structure. This can help drive repeat business and VIP retention without making it seem like you’re selling anyone short. Simply convert points or punches into different tiers, and then group rewards into batches. A tiered structure can help encourage repeat visits, higher sales, and better loyalty.
Likewise, membership programs go a step beyond traditional loyalty programs by providing a special “elite” status to which customers can aspire. There are many creative ways which small businesses can provide incentives to valuable customers that will drive additional spend and visit frequency, often to great effect.
Introduce a higher customer tier.
Already using a membership structure? Treat your VIPs like true royals by reserving the best perks for those customers that bring in the biggest sales. Create a tier just for them with non-costly, high-value perks to make that top level extra-aspirational. For example, offer exclusive access to a pre-sale event or off-menu tasting dinner where your product can shine and your customers can feel extra privileged. Think about ways to give your most loyal customers that feeling of rarity, while also showcasing your business in a low-cost way. It’s a win-win for your business and your customers.
Switch between points and punches.
As Starbucks discovered, simply rewarding someone for coming in does not bring in the same value as rewarding someone for purchasing at a certain dollar spend. Pivoting from punches to points can give you a way to motivate the type of behavior you’re looking for. One way to do this is to “convert” everyone’s existing punches into points; then, use a tiered system to encourage people to spend to the next level.
Alternately, if your business is already in the business of having high dollar spend per transaction (hardware stores, landscaping businesses, and dentists, for example), you may want to go to the opposite direction. Trading points for punches is a better way to get people in the door when accumulating points just seems too difficult. Be careful that earning the benefits from your rewards program doesn’t seem insurmountable to your customers—you may be discouraging the behavior you want to entice!
Using a card? Go digital.
Plastic loyalty cards, or even paper punch cards, can start to drain on your budget. Save on the costs of administering your loyalty program—and open new ways to upsell or collect user data—by using an app like Clover Rewards. A digital loyalty program also gives you the opportunity to tailor your rewards to specific customers, thereby saving in ways that might not have high visibility to other customers. Likewise, if you do decide to switch from points to punches (or vice versa), Clover Rewards is built to make that transition as easy as possible.
It’s true that sometimes a devaluation of your rewards program is necessary. However, if you if you redefine the program, it can seem more like you’re creating new opportunities for your customers, and right the ship in no time.

news_368,news,New & notable in the Clover App Market: June 2018,"Looking to engage more customers on Yelp, manage recurring membership invoices, or infuse a fast-paced Wall Street vibe into your gastro pub? Check out the new and notable apps featured this month in the Clover App Market. 
…",12-06-2018,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/new-notable-in-the-clover-app-market-june-2018/,"If you haven’t checked out the Clover App Market lately, now’s the time. Whether you’re looking to manage your business profile, comments or reviews on Yelp, simplify recurring billing for your members, or infuse the fast-paced vibe of Wall Street into a gastro pub setting, the Clover App Market can help.
Take a look at these three new and updated apps:
Yelp for Business Owners
Each month, more than 100 million visitors turn to Yelp for information, ratings, and reviews on all kinds of businesses, from personal trainers to salons. For small businesses, that means important exposure to the local markets they serve and an opportunity to convert some Yelp users into customers.
Now, Yelp has introduced Yelp for Business Owners to make it easier for businesses to connect with customers and access important business analytics on the go. With this app, you can respond to customer messages and reviews with a private message or public comment. It lets you track visitors, customer leads, and access reports of estimated revenues generated by customers who find your business on Yelp. The best part? Clover merchants can connect to it directly from the Clover dashboard.
Getting started is a snap. Just download the app and follow the instructions to claim your Yelp Business Page. It’s free and takes a mere two minutes. And for a limited time, Clover merchants who sign up for the Yelp for Business Owners app will receive $300 in credits from Yelp!
Memberships
Whether you own a Pilates studio, a gym or a golf course, the Memberships app is a must-have for any business that offers subscription services. This app helps businesses ­­manage memberships, subscriptions, and even recurring customer billing directly from your Clover device.
The Memberships app lets businesses define an unlimited number of memberships—with custom pricing—and automate billing for monthly events. Swipe a card once, and charge that same card on a regular basis. You can even set up email receipts, reminders of recurring payments, and notices to alert customers when issues arise—like expired cards. And you can deactivate and reactivate members without losing their billing information.
With its volume-based pricing, the Memberships app makes finding and managing an unlimited number of members and membership types simple and affordable.
Food and Drink Exchange
Say “fast-paced excitement” and someone’s bound to mention Wall Street, conjuring the exhilaration of the unexpected and the emotional flurry of highs and lows. One of the newest apps to hit the Clover App Market taps into that Wall Street rush.
Food and Drink Exchange brings the excitement of dynamic pricing to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and other food sellers. As customers purchase items and influence the market, they can watch prices change in real-time. The more an item is ordered, the more that in-demand product will cost, and the prices of other items fall. Great for stirring up a lively happy hour or an all-day extravaganza, dynamic pricing can create a fun atmosphere and increase your profits.
The Food and Drink Exchange app connects easily to your Clover POS and captures pricing changes in real time. Most importantly, businesses have full control—they can turn dynamic pricing on or off anytime and are billed only for the time used. With lots of safeguards in place, the Food and Drink Exchange app is designed to increase income. If it doesn’t, you’re not charged for using it.
With these great apps and many others, the Clover App Market offers your business creative tools that help you engage your customers, keep a step ahead of your competitors, and turn a profit.

news_370,news,Enterprise behavior: How to calculate your restaurant’s food costs,Want to keep your restaurant’s costs down? Calculating your food costs is a great place to start. This step-by-step guide to calculating your restaurant’s food costs will help you make sure you’re on track to success.…,14-06-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-how-to-calculate-your-restaurants-food-costs/,"The dream of running a restaurant may include curating the perfect space for joyful gatherings and magical evenings of great food and drink, with you playing the gracious host, who just happens to profit off the whole happy affair.
But the reality of running a restaurant is more like living life in the eye of a storm. The daily barrage of customer demands, managing cooks and wait staff, mounting stress from the 24/7 nature of the job and staying ahead of the competition—all on razor-thin margins.
There’s a lot to stay on top of in the pursuit of profitability. Perhaps you’ve relied on business techniques such as sales promotions, honing your marketing strategy, or nailing an effective advertising plan. These customer-facing methods are helpful, but it’s also important to look within. It’s less splashy, but absolutely essential to the health of your restaurant.
Today, we’re going to focus on one critical component that can make the difference between whether your restaurant thrives or shuts down—managing your food cost percentage.
Your food cost percentage directly impacts your bottom line.
What is it? Simply put, it calculates the cost of your ingredients as a percentage of food sales.
Especially for restaurants operating on barely-there profits, any variation in the cost of your ingredients or mismanagement of inventory can deeply impact your margins.

1. Calculate ideal food cost
Most restaurants work with a food cost percentage of roughly 20 to 30 percent. But the real comparison game you want to play is comparing your actual food cost with your ideal food cost.
Your ideal food cost will be different from your actual food cost because it won’t account for variances that occur in the real world, such as wasted inventory, serving inconsistent portions, theft and fluctuations in market prices. And that’s the point—this benchmark will help you identify where your actual food cost has gone astray.
Here’s the formula for calculating your ideal food cost.
Total cost of ingredients used in all plates ÷ total sales = Ideal food cost
So let’s break this formula down.
Total cost of ingredients used in all plates. You arrive at this number by calculating exactly what ingredients, and how much of each ingredient, goes into each menu item.
For the sake of simplicity, let’s say your restaurant is a food truck selling only chips and guacamole. An order of chips and guacamole would include the per-plate cost of the chips, avocado, onion, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, salt and lime. Then you’d multiply this cost by the number of these items sold in this period. You can pull this information using Clover Insights.
And if you’re operating a restaurant with a full menu, you would do this for every menu item and add everything up for your total cost of ingredients used in all plates.
Total sales. Multiply the sales prices of each dish by the number of each dish sold.
If we look simply at the chips and guacamole food truck example, the ideal food cost is calculated as follows:
Per-plate cost of ingredients for chips and guacamole: $1
Number of units sold this week: 100
Cost of ingredients: $1 x 100 = $100
Per-plate sales price for chips and guacamole: $4
Number of units sold this week: 100
Food sales: $4 x 100 = $400
Total cost of ingredients used in all plates ÷ total food sales = Ideal food costs
100 ÷ 400 = 0.25
Your ideal food cost percentage is 25%.
Doing this calculation manually for your entire menu is cumbersome, but with the right inventory and sales software, you can have this calculation run automatically.

2. Calculate actual food cost
Now it’s time to calculate your actual food cost percentage.
You’ll use this formula:
(Beginning inventory + Purchases – Ending inventory) ÷ Food sales = Actual food cost
Let’s stick to the same one week time period. Again, let’s break this formula down.
Beginning inventory. At the start of the week you’ll calculate the total cost of all of your inventory.
Purchases. Calculate the cost of all new inventory purchased that week.
Ending inventory. At the end of the week, calculate the cost of all of your remaining inventory
Food sales. At the end of the week, add up your total food sales generated during this period.
Going back to our chips and guacamole food truck example, let’s say we came up with the following numbers:
Beginning inventory: $60
Purchases: $80
Ending Inventory: $20
Food sales: $400
(Beginning inventory + Purchases – Ending inventory) ÷ Food sales = Actual food cost
($60 + $80 – $20) ÷ $400
$120 ÷ $400 = 0.30
Your actual food cost percentage is 30%.

3. Compare actual cost vs. ideal cost
Now that you have both your ideal cost and actual cost figures, compare the two. Using our chips and guacamole food truck example, there’s a discrepancy. Our ideal food cost percentage is 25%, compared with our actual food cost percentage of 30%, which tells us that something is amiss, and gives us reason to investigate further.

4. Investigate discrepancies
Many reasons could explain the actual vs. ideal cost discrepancy and each has its own solution.

You may discover that there’s been a change in the cost of certain ingredients. Consider updating the price of your menu items to account for this increase. Buying seasonal items can also help reign in your costs. This may prompt you to redesign your menu and the ingredients you use on a seasonal basis.
If you realize that employees are dishing up inconsistent portions, perhaps additional employee training and an emphasis on proper measurements is in order.
And of course, if your investigation leads you to discover employee theft, you know what to do.
Pay attention to the dishes that come back to the kitchen at the end of the meal. If there is still a lot of food remaining on the plate, this is wasted inventory. Reduce your portion sizes.
Use Insights to see which menu items sell and which do not. Consider removing items that aren’t selling.

At the end of the day, having these two calculations offer you critical insight into your restaurant’s profitability and help you pinpoint exactly where you can improve.
As a restaurant owner, your work is nonstop as you juggle managing employees, keeping customers happy and implementing strategies to expand your business.
But remember that despite the nonstop activity on the restaurant floor, it’s crucial that you take time to pause and examine what’s happening behind the scenes. By keeping an eye on your inventory and food cost metrics and making adjustments to prices, portions, and other factors based on the numbers you see, you’ll be on your way toward increased profitability.

news_371,news,"Top tasks to outsource, top tasks to keep in-house","Wouldn’t it be great to get help with administrative tasks? Learn about affordable apps that automate payroll, scheduling, bookkeeping, and SEO. With less busy work, you can focus on the customer-facing functions that make or break the business.
…",19-06-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-top-tasks-to-outsource-top-tasks-to-keep-in-house/,"When you run a small business, squeezing more work out of each day becomes urgent.
While “multitasking” has been proven false, many are trying a similar trick—rapidly jumping from task to task. Wrong again. Research confirms that task-switching results in squashed productivity. Worse, it makes people vulnerable to mistakes.
The take-away for small business owners is that getting more done requires getting real help. There’s just too much to do, and errors can be costly. But who can afford to hire more people or contract outside professionals?
Technology can help. Clover offers a suite of apps that simplify core tasks, at a fraction of the price of outsourcing to firms. Let’s look at some of the quickest ways to lighten the workload, along with areas that benefit from closer oversight and a personal touch.
Top tasks to outsource
Payroll: It’s a tedious. It’s time-consuming. And it must be done right. Mess up your payroll, and the IRS will quickly slap large penalties on the business.
Gusto takes care of everything: unlimited payrolls, workers’ comp, benefits, 401(k), automatic payroll filings, W-2s, 1099s, even direct deposit. For a small monthly fee, the app helps you run the operation in five minutes or less.
Clover merchants can download the app on their POS and test it for free. Find out how much easier it can be to pay employees and handle complicated deductions without worrying about slip-ups.
Employee scheduling: Scheduling can be the ultimate example of task-switching. Gathering input, putting out schedules, rearranging time slots as the change requests pour in—it’s a massive productivity buster!
Technology can do it faster and better. Time Clock by Homebase lets you quickly build schedules and share them by email or text. The app automatically manages time-off requests and shift trades, and it sends reminders before shifts begin.
The app even gathers hours for payroll, handles tips, and offers a real-time analysis of labor expenses. Best of all, it comes free with the Clover POS.
Bookkeeping: Who has time to manage sales data on top of running a small business? No one, of course. And no one needs to, either.
When you close up for the day, Commerce Sync transfers sales data into Quickbooks or Zero. Wake up, and the previous day’s sales, fees, taxes, tips, discounts, and more have been added to your accounting software. You can even track sales by categories, or consolidate figures from multiple locations into a single report.
Customers report saving 300 hours a year—or $15,000 in manual data-entry expenses. One affordable app is all it takes to keep the books accurate and complete.
SEO for Web Presence: With digital tools, marketing can be quick and inexpensive. But it can also be a never-ending task, with little visible impact to the bottom line.
That’s where search engine optimization (SEO) stands out. SEO organically positions a website at the top of customers’ searches. It’s one of the most effective ways to let people know about your business.
Step one is to create a Google My Business account to ensure that listings pop up in local search results. Next, make sure that relevant keywords appear in your website, blogs, social media, and other content.
Inexpensive apps such TAPLocal Marketing will score your efforts and make suggestions for achieving 100-percent accuracy. Using SEO business-listing optimization drives people through the doors—big results from little effort.
Top tasks to keep in-house
Hiring: Some tasks can’t be outsourced effectively, especially for small businesses. While big companies might rely on HR departments or outside firms to get great people on board, small businesses need a personal approach—particularly when low unemployment makes it harder to find employees.
Create great buzz about working for your business. Get referrals from current employees. Offer low-cost perks to sweeten the deal. All of these can help attract strong candidates with the right attitudes, energy, and willingness to learn. It’s up to you to spot them and bring them on board.
To make the mechanics of hiring a little easier, check out these free HR resources from Homebase, including job descriptions, new hire forms, hiring guides, performance reviews, and more.
Training: Like hiring, in-house training is not only cheaper than using external trainers, but also more effective. Small business owners know exactly what needs to be done and how to do it.
But while the immediate goal is to get newcomers up to speed in their roles, it’s also helpful to think bigger and further ahead. As time allows, train reliable employees in every aspect of the business—from frontline service to behind-the-scenes operations. Teach them to step into your shoes when you’re not there. Get experienced employees who excel in specific areas to take on training roles.
Employees who feel competent, valued, and continually gaining skills are more likely to stay engaged and committed.
Customer service: You and your team are the face of the business. Every interaction can entice customers back or drive them away. But it’s not just face-to-face encounters at your main location that count. Phone calls, email exchanges, social media, and mobile operations are equally important.
Ensuring a positive experience at every touchpoint falls to business owners. No one is better at training employees properly, setting the tone for communications, and resolving problems promptly.
To keep customers happy, keep customer service in house.
Everyone needs help running a business. When you put repetitive tasks on autopilot, there’s more time to look after the personal interactions that bring customers back again and again.

news_372,news,6 ways seasonal businesses can take advantage of the off-season,"Running a seasonal business comes with unique challenges, especially off-season. But it also comes with the opportunity to tackle activities that elevate your business in the long term. Here are six strategies for making the most of your downtime.
…",20-06-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/6-ways-seasonal-businesses-can-take-advantage-of-the-off-season/,"For seasonal businesses, off-season can seem like a daunting stretch of time. The buzz of customers grows quiet and life in the fast lane comes to a sudden stop.
But don’t think of this period as a drag on the business. Whether you run a paddleboarding company, farmers market stand, or a gelato shop, downtime can actually be productive, if not crucial for the long-term health of your business. It’s a time for reflection and evaluating the company’s priorities and direction. It’s also an opportunity for streamlining your systems, updating best practices and turning small business ideas into action plans.
Think of it as spring cleaning for your business. Here are a few tips for clearing out the cobwebs and freshening up in the slow season.
Spruce up your space.
Here’s something you won’t want to do during peak season: renovate. Off-season offers the perfect opportunity for making improvements, big or small, to make your space more welcoming and productive. Maybe it’s as simple as redesigning your in-store signage to help usher customers from piqued interest to completed purchase in no time. Whether it’s slapping a fresh coat of paint on your walls, doing a gut renovation of your restaurant’s bathrooms or reorganizing your shelving displays, scheduling these improvements when business is slow is the best way to update your place in the least intrusive way. And bonus: these changes give you the opportunity to have an unveiling event when you reopen.
Freshen up your marketing strategy.
And what better way to promote your revamped space than through a fresh, focused marketing campaign? Once your customer base dwindles, you’ll finally have the time to hammer out new promotion ideas and figure out how to attract new customers. Embrace your extra time and use it to develop multiple avenues for reaching a wider market. The risk you run during the off season is falling off the radar of your customers, which is why advertising and seasonal marketing during this time is so important. You’ll want to play up the opening and closing of your seasons with big promotions that hit the media and social media platforms your customers frequent.
Cut back on hours.
For yourself and your staff, cutting back on hours might actually come as a relief with a two-birds, one-stone benefits: you not only give everyone a break from the hectic peak-season life, you also reduce costs during a time with less revenue.
Focus on your staff.
Good employees are hard to come by. When you find them, hold on tight because the cost of hiring and training new folks takes a toll. But how do you retain staff members who leave at the end of the season? The best way is to offer incentives to return the next season. You can reward return employees with seniority status that grants certain perks like extra days off, a small raise, or product discounts. You can keep in touch with them during the off-season or in preparation of peak season with special professional development offerings such as team bonding activities or leadership training. Ultimately, you’ll want to find ways to boost staff morale, while honoring your bottom line. This is also an opportunity to address staff concerns, such as improving communication. By taking the time to prioritize your staff, you’ll reduce staff attrition and increase your chances of seeing familiar staff members return each season with a smile.
Evaluate your inventory.
You don’t want an oversupply of inventory during your off season. When things slow down, this is a good time to review your sales history. Take note of the typical quantity and mix of products you sell during your peak season, edit these figures for any growth or changes, and stock your inventory accordingly for the coming peak season. And for many businesses, the off season doesn’t mean shutting down completely. If that’s your shop, be sure to keep your customers’ favorite items in stock, so long as they’re not impacted by seasonal fluctuations.
Plan for the future and set goals.
Off-season is the perfect time for big-picture strategic planning and making a plan to take your business to new heights. You can analyze your business’ growth via Clover Insights. Challenge yourself to narrate what’s changing with your business, for good or for bad. What products have emerged as most popular? How are your revenues and costs tracking compared to last year’s benchmarks? What does your customer base look like? What can you learn from examining VIP customer activity? How does your business compare to similar businesses in your neighborhood? Is it time to recalculate your pricing? Because this requires heavy introspection and analysis, it’s best to do this when you’ve actually got the time to dream.
Running a seasonal business comes with unique challenges, and navigating the slow seasons can bring anxiety. But if you reframe those months as an opportunity, rather than a drag, you can dedicate that time toward activities that elevate your business in the long term.

news_373,news,Crowd pleasers: Harnessing the power of customer testimonials,"Google a business, find bad customer reviews and you’re likely moving on. How can small businesses manage customer feedback and harness the power of positive customer comments to grow business? Take these three steps to capitalize on standout customer testimonials.
…",21-06-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-harnessing-the-power-of-customer-testimonials/,"Google a restaurant, plumber, or salon, find a 2-star rating and terrible customer reviews and you’re likely moving on to the next restaurant, plumber, or salon. Find a business online you’ve never heard of before with stellar customer comments, and you’re likely going to try it out.
If you recognize yourself in these scenarios, you’re not alone. According to a recent survey, 97% of consumers went online for information about local businesses in 2017. And 85% put as much trust in online reviews as personal recommendations.
For small business owners, online customer reviews are the keys to a sterling digital reputation and new customers or a tarnished reputation and lost prospects. So how can you know what customers are saying? Further, how can you use top-shelf customer comments to build your business?
Crafting a standout online reputation through customer testimonials is a journey made one step at a time. And these three steps can start you on your way.
1. Listen to your customers.
Knowing what’s being said about your business is half the battle. And you need to know the good, the bad, and the ugly of customer conversations to get a realistic picture of your online reputation. Fortunately, these tools make listening to customer conversations online easier than ever.
Search: Don’t underestimate the power of search. Google your business or search it with your favorite engine. Note what results display, where your business ranks in results and what sites provide ratings or reviews of your business. Don’t forget that Google Maps allows consumers to rate places they’ve visited—and that could include your business.
Social: Small businesses often set up profiles on social tools like Facebook, Twitter, or Yelp, but, in the frenzy of the everyday, forget to read or respond to customer comments. Try taking a little time to visit your Facebook page, peruse your Twitter or Instagram accounts, and check out the comments customers have left. Look for themes in the conversation and where the most chatter is happening.
2. Engage Your fans and your critics.
Reach out to fans and critics—you can learn from both. Two apps in the Clover App Market help you engage customers in conversation and stay on top of customer chatter.
Yelp for Business puts the power of Yelp at your fingertips. It gives you the ability to respond to customer messages and reviews with a private message or public comment right from your Clover dashboard and lets you track visitors, customer leads, and access important reports, like estimated revenues generated by customers who find your business on Yelp.
With little to no setup required, the Feedback app lets you hear directly from your customers, find out what they love most about your business, and helps keep harmful negative feedback off public review sites.
3. Weave your fans into your marketing.
Infusing positive customer testimonials into your marketing gives your customers a voice for positive experiences and offers you a way to market your business through a source customers trust—other customers. But how do you capture and effectively use customer testimonials? Start by asking.
Define your ideal type of feedback before you begin soliciting customer comments. Maybe a like, a share, or a comment on Yelp is a best-fit for your business. Or maybe a video or written testimonial would suit better. Effective testimonials are concise, specific and focus on what’s most important to your customers and your business. Plan to include concrete customer details like names, faces, places and dates where possible. But be sure to get your customers’ permission.
Ask your customers for feedback. Email recent customers. Or consider approaching your best customers personally to show appreciation for their business and comments. Get specific when soliciting comments: What exactly did customers like about the transaction? How much money, time, or hassle did your product or service save them? Remember to keep your request for comments clear and simple—plan to follow-up with a thank you.
Get permission before using customers’ reviews, comments, or testimonials in your public-facing marketing. Establish mutually-agreed-upon rules of engagement with a simple form that customers review and sign. Can you use full names, first names, or initials? Do they agree to your using their photos? What media channels are in- or out-of-bounds? Remember, customers who agree to testimonials are fans of your business, so do your best to respect their boundaries.
Weave testimonials into the fabric of your digital marketing content. Infuse testimonials into your website. Ask customers for shout outs on Twitter, to like you on Facebook and Instagram, and to follow you on Pinterest. Wherever you have a presence, consider including testimonials and recommendations. Keep in mind, you’re not obliged to use testimonials exactly as customers submit them: edit spelling and correct grammar or paraphrase, if needed. Just be sure to keep testimonials fresh by updating regularly.
However you decide to use them, customer testimonials can reinforce and communicate your strengths. Tap these resources often and wisely.

news_377,news,How to use POS data to improve inventory management,"Retailers and brands need to have constant access to their POS inventory data to spot trends and correct problems in real time. Moving toward this proactive inventory mindset means using data every step of the way, from planning and buying to selling and reordering.…",02-07-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-to-use-pos-data-to-improve-inventory-management/,"The following article was contributed by Emily Fanning, a Marketing Associate at Springboard Retail. 
Retail is experiencing a shift, and there’s no doubt about it! But that’s all it is—a shift. Notions of “the death of retail” and “the Amazon Apocalypse”—those are not happening on our watch. The industry is changing, but the future of retail is promising and bright, as long as retailers are willing to be agile, creative, and intensely focused on using data to drive their business decisions, especially inventory management.
Strong inventory management is directly died to profitability in retail. Today’s shoppers have high expectations; they want to be able to shop seamlessly wherever, whenever, and they demand inventory visibility. It’s 2018, and managing your inventory is no longer a set-it and forget-it endeavor. Retailers and brands need to have constant access to their POS inventory data to spot trends and correct problems in real time. Moving toward this proactive inventory mindset means using data every step of the way, from planning and buying to selling and reordering.
Data to Buy
Traditionally, retailers relied on space-driven planning. X square feet = $x of product, and we want a 10% increase in sales over last year. Done.
Not so much. Today’s thriving retailers are breaking their sales plans into microplans by category, vendor, store location, and more. They’re looking at historical data to determine how many shoes were sold within the month of May, how yellow dresses performed versus white, if one locations sells Brand X better than the other, and if pants sell “well,” but at a low margin. And once that inventory has arrived at the store, they’re watching sales and adapting based on current conditions and trends.
Imagine that boots had their highest performing days during February last year, and—rightfully and strategically so—you buy this year’s assortment based on that data. But this February gets hit with an unseasonable warm front, leaving customers in need of more warm-weather shoes. The agile retailer has already spotted this trend and made vendor swaps and reorders to fulfill inventory demands for the current conditions, creating satisfied customers and preventing excessive markdowns on out-of-season products.
Determining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
A good retail management system offers retailers and brands the ability to create custom fields to collect the data that is most relevant to their business. Fields for attributes like season, style, even fabric or delivery can help provide a more detailed inventory analysis. And if your POS offers custom fields, it should also offer custom reports. Running these will help retailers identify opportunities and issues such as:
• Dead stock and cash tied up in merchandise that is not moving
• Excess inventory forcing margin-killing markdowns
• Low inventory for high performing stock
• Out-of-balance inventory or too much inventory in one channel that is moving in another
Here are three of our favorite reports to tackle such.
Sell-Through
Units Sold ÷ Units Received ? 100
Freshness is the name of the game! Run this report as often as you can—by brand, by category, by class, and more. It will identify when to reorder something, when to mark it down, or when to renegotiate with a vendor. That’s right, calculating sell-through for brands can help you build a vendor scorecard, which will give you the data you need to negotiate better pricing and terms with your vendors.
Inventory Turn
Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Avg. Inventory On Hand Value
Run this report to determine how rapidly your stock is selling and how well your cash is flowing. The higher the number the better, as that means your inventory is moving quickly! Ask yourself, am I stocking too much or too little of one category? Is an item performing well in one location but not the other—should I initiate a transfer? Did a particular marketing campaign lead to a higher turnover?
Gross Margin by Category, Style, Vendor
Total Net Sales – Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Total Net Sales
Here you’ll get a quick snapshot of which categories, styles, and vendors are performing best over time. It’s a great example of why retailers need to buy based on data as opposed to instinct; be honest and ask yourself, am I buying merchandise that is actually making me money? What categories are actually returning a profit? Which vendors should I invest more heavily in?
Have we convinced you yet? No matter the business size, data is key when it comes to surviving versus thriving in this shifting retail climate. Retailers who are meticulous in their approach to inventory management, use a robust POS system as the engine for their business, and respond quickly to the data they collect, will be the ultimate winners.

news_378,news,"QSRs, it pays to get creative with food promotions. Here’s how one Clover merchant did it.","Matthew Ling runs three restaurants in downtown Newark. Clover’s promo’s calendars have helped him design successful specials. Sales increased, a staff morale got a boost. Read on to learn how. …",08-07-2018,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/qsrs-it-pays-to-get-creative-with-food-promotions-heres-how/,"Meet Matthew Ling. Matt runs three restaurants in the heart of downtown Newark, New Jersey: Mercato Tomato Pie, Noodle Shop & Bar, and Novelty Burger.
Since joining the team a few months ago, Matt has prioritized the important work—growing the bottom line by increasing profit margins and raising the average amount each customer spends per visit. There are lots of ways to accomplish this, but one of Matt’s strategies is especially effective: he leverages Clover’s monthly promo calendar for ideas on how to optimize the customer experience, keep them interested and grow sales.
Clover publishes a monthly calendar of oddball and lesser-known holidays a few weeks before each month begins. In this simple download, you can find tips for special promotions, helping you drive loyalty and strengthen employee morale.
We had a chance to talk with Matt about his experiments with special holiday promotions. Here’s some of the knowledge he imparted to us.
1. Establishing priorities in a new position
Before joining the management team of Rockplaza Restaurant Group, Matt was a longtime bar manager in the area. He was well aware of the challenges of running a bar/restaurant in downtown Newark, including serving a clientele that swarms at the lunch rush but is often absent for dinner. Similarly, the proximity to the Prudential Center arena, the 19,500-seat home to NHL team the New Jersey Devils, meant that whenever there was a game there was a huge rush of people with strict time constraints.
Matt’s strategy is to focus on foot traffic, and make the very most of it. In a single block, Matt told us, he has eight separate competitors, a mix of quick-serve and full-service restaurants. Figuring out how to separate from the crowd was crucial as he developed the restaurants’ revenue strategy.
He realized that creating simple promotions didn’t require huge amounts of lead time, but could affect real change on the bottom line, the loyalty of the customers, and the energy of his staff. While social media is important, his clientele is more likely to make a spontaneous decision on the street with coworkers than plan ahead. Matt realized this was an opportunity to experiment, trying different promotions to see what worked best.
2. Success with spaghetti
Matt decided to celebrate National Pasta Day on October 17th, in part because it was featured on our October 2018 promo calendar. He offered a 20% discount on all pasta dishes that day, and created special table toppers advertising the special. Matt then led a brief staff meeting where he incentivized pasta sales, and offered a $30 Visa gift card to the server who sold the most pasta dishes per hour during their shift.
Servers enjoyed the friendly competition, and Matt noticed a clear lift in energy and morale. He credits much of this lift to a simple change in routine—“It didn’t feel like a regular Wednesday.” Overall, this special boosted sales 28% above average for Wednesdays, a success from Matt’s point of view. It also helped increase the popularity of pasta dishes at Mercato, which have a greater profit margin than other items on the menu.
3. Planning for the future
Matt planned his pasta promotion just a week and a half before the event: it’s important to remember that you can experiment with specials even if you feel like you’re still focusing week to week.
There will be more promotions down the road for Rockplaza, and we hope you try some of them too. Take a look at our promo calendars, and see what could work for your business. Don’t be afraid to try something goofy (Mickey Mouse’s Birthday is coming up very soon) and see what happens.

news_379,news,Business scenario: 6 signs of employee dissatisfaction you should address now,"In the busyness of running a business, it’s easy to lose touch with how employees are doing. But when people sour on their jobs, the business can go down with them. Learn to spot the signs of unhappiness—and build a positive workplace that prospers. 
…",10-07-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-6-signs-of-employee-dissatisfaction-you-should-address-now/,"Everyone wants employees who love their jobs, engage with customers, and contribute to a business’ success. Yet many don’t fit that profile. In fact, nearly 50 percent of employees say that they’re dissatisfied, according to a recent Conference Board survey.
When employees are unhappy, they disconnect from their jobs. They begin underperforming—and undercutting the great customer experience that independent establishments depend on.
For small business owners, it’s important to regularly scan the workplace for discontent. Here are six signs that something is amiss and needs fixing immediately.
1. It’s quieter than normal.
At first glance, it may seem like there’s less chatting and fooling around. People are more focused on the tasks at hand. So why worry?
Beneath the surface, workplace conflict may be taking a toll on both employees and the business. Ask the staff why they’re interacting less. Listen carefully to alternate views, but steer people away from angry accusations.
Instead, try to frame interpersonal problems as process problems: How can we change the daily routines to prevent this from happening? How can we communicate better so small problems don’t escalate?
By getting people to work on finding solutions, business owners can steer the team back on track.
2. The gossip mill churns.
Instead of no talking, the opposite phenomenon can also occur, as people huddle in private chats. Their talk may be innocent, of course. But it may also point to deep-seated unhappiness.
Toxic workplaces are marked by negativity, tearing down others, and destructive gossip. For business owners, toxicity can be a reflection of their own weak leadership. While painful to confront, it’s a problem that can be corrected by cultivating a supportive workplace.
In supportive workplaces, employees are valued and acknowledged. People form a close-knit group who enjoy the tasks, the mission, and each other. A few simple actions can make a difference.
Recognize people’s efforts. Praise them publicly and often. Be transparent about the business’ challenges and successes, and encourage others to collaborate and treat each other respectfully. As a bonus, business owners might take the team on outings or retreats—a great way to celebrate and bond, even on a shoestring budget.
3. People stroll in late (if at all).
One telltale sign that people are checking out is when they regularly show up late or call in sick. Not only does this dampen productivity, but it also puts an extra burden on the people who are there—lowering job satisfaction for everyone.
Employers need to deal with excessive tardiness and absence. Talk with people and find out what’s going on. Do they have transportation problems? Are their shift times unmanageable? Do they need more predictability in when and where they work?
Consider using software such as Time Clock by Homebase, which quickly creates schedules and sends them via text or email to staff. Employees are able to swap shifts with teammates, request time off, and update their availabilities instantly. Letting people gain some control can go a long way toward boosting morale.
If problems persist, most HR pros recommend progressive discipline. The process might start with a verbal warning, proceed to a written warning, then a suspension, and finally termination, with each step thoroughly documented in writing to avoid legal exposure.
4. A star employee burns out.
When applied to the workplace, the 80/20 rule says that 80 percent of output comes from 20 percent of employees. The best employees, then, are critical for success. When a reliable performer begins lagging on the job, business owners must act. It could be a signal that all is not well.
Meet with the employee and try to find out what’s wrong. In many cases, people feel stuck in their jobs, unable to advance. The 2017 Conference Board survey on workplace satisfaction found that only 25 percent of respondents were happy with their employers’ promotion policies, and 31 percent with job training.
While another position might not be available, consider other avenues of advancement. Entrust valuable team members to make some business decisions on their own. Train them to handle the work schedules, purchasing, and bookkeeping. Developing new skills and experiences can benefit everyone, even you.
5. No one exerts much effort.
You know you have a problem when employees don’t speak up or offer ideas. They resist putting in any extra effort. They’re indifferent to the customers. The business simply won’t survive without a radical shift in attitudes.
While the problem is huge, the solution can be surprisingly simple: recognition. In a study conducted by the O.C. Tanner Institute and documented in Appreciate: Celebrating People, Inspiring Greatness, employees ages 25-35 were asked what their boss or company could do to motivate great work. Standing out among all the answers was “recognize me,” cited by 41 percent of respondents.
Small business owners need to show that they see and appreciate efforts. Give employees paths to more responsibility, learning, and even pay. Consider inexpensive perks to make daily life more enjoyable. And make acknowledging and celebrating a job well done part of the culture.
6. Turnover has spiked.
People don’t leave companies. They leave bosses. It’s a common saying that’s very often true.
Whether the expressed reason is lack of recognition, inflexible scheduling policies, less-than-competitive pay, toxic coworkers, suboptimal working conditions, or blocked career paths, all roads lead back to the boss.
When turnover rises, it’s time to act fast. Sit down with employees before they depart and ask what triggered their job search. Employers should address specific concerns unearthed in exit interviews, while also keeping an eye on the bigger picture: creating a great working environment.
Nothing attracts and keeps employees like a positive workplace. Millennials, in particular, who make up a third of all workers, enjoy having control over their schedules, receiving meaningful training opportunities, and feeling like valuable contributors on a team.
In the busyness of running a business, it’s easy to lose touch with how employees are doing. But when people sour on their jobs, the business can go down with them. Learn to spot the signs of unhappiness—and build a positive workplace that prospers.

news_380,news,5 questions to ask before hiring a graphic designer,"Did you know that 93% of purchase judgments are made based on visual perceptions? First impressions matter: if there were ever a place to cut corners, your logo design is not it. 
Hire the right graphic designer for your brand by asking these five important questions. 
…",11-07-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-before-hiring-a-graphic-designer/,"First impressions matter. Nine times out of ten, the first impression your customer has of your business is your logo. From your logo, they will form an opinion about your business. Research shows that 93% of purchase judgments are made based on visual perceptions. If there were ever a place to cut corners, your logo design is not it.
The design decisions you make when crafting your brand’s image will inform the look of what you build as your business grows. Things like signage, flyers, business cards, and website should share a consistent look that clearly articulates your brand. Unified designs driven by a proper logo can make a small company feel much larger and more professional.
Hiring a graphic designer is the only surefire way to make sure your logo and branding represents your business as well as you do. But with so many designers out there, how can you find the right person to bring your vision to life? Start with these five important questions to ask when interviewing graphic designers.
1. What experience do you have?
This question may seem obvious—but it’s important for a few different reasons. First, it gives you some background about a designer’s level of experience. Generally, you don’t need a designer with 20 years of experience to do a simple logo, but you should expect that younger or less experienced designers may not actually save you money. Less experience may lend itself to lower rates, but freelancers who are new to the field may not always ask the right questions to guide your vision. In the long run, designers with less experience may end up costing you more as you go through the design process.
The other layer to this question is that it helps determine what a graphic designer can and cannot do for you. If you’ve never worked with a graphic designer before, it’s important to clarify what skills they bring to the table. Generally, expect a designer to be able to visualize the look, feel, and layout of your logo or website—but they cannot code or develop a page for you from scratch. Ask them what skills they will bring to the table from their past experience, and make sure to adjust your expectations accordingly.
2. Can I see your portfolio and examples of your work?
A designer’s portfolio is one of the quickest ways to tell if their style of work is going to be compatible with the look and feel of your business. Ask for a portfolio to see if a designer has the level of experience they say they have, and to see if they’ve done work in your industry before. A portfolio can also give you a sampling of the type of work they do—if you see lots of advertising work, but not as many logos, you can assume they might have a distinct specialty.
When you work with a designer, expect to bring some of your own homework to the table. If you have an inkling or vision of what you want your designer to bring to life, try to bring some samples of that vision to the interview. Use Pinterest to create a mood board with images and graphics you feel represent your brand. You can compare the things you’ve pinned with a designer’s past portfolio to see if this partnership is a match made in design heaven. Their portfolio should be in a style that complements your business—and make sure you like it.
3. How, and how much, do you charge?
Unfortunately, there’s no standard pricing scheme that every designer abides. Different designers will set prices based on experience, the project scope, and the competitive market. Few designers will actually charge an hourly rate; many prefer to go based on a set project fee. This usually works out to be beneficial for you, as there are rarely hidden costs and you don’t need to micromanage the designer’s working hours.
There are other variables you should ask about when negotiating a designer’s fee. Will they use stock images, licensed fonts, or other proprietary tools? This should be agreed upon at the beginning of your relationship: will you need to pay a fee up-front, pay ongoing as images are used, or expect a bill for the images at the end of the project?
Lastly, when negotiating a pay rate, ask about the payment terms. Does the designer expect payment in full? A deposit with balance due on completion? Or a deposit with regular installments? Have a conversation about edits and rework. Most designers will already have a policy in place for how many rounds of edits they are willing to commit to, so you need to clarify the specifics.
4. What is your working process?
The interview is the best time to learn about a particular designer’s process. By understanding how the graphic designer works, you’ll get a better sense of what to expect: how they will prioritize your business, and how they intend to translate your ideas to images.
Some designers will have a questionnaire for you to fill out, while others might ask you to make a Pinterest board or creative brief. If a designer doesn’t have some process to understand the feel of your business, they most likely won’t be able to give you exactly what you’re looking for. When you interview a designer, take note of how they see this specific project fitting into your overall business goals. Are they thinking about this as a one-off project, or can they commit to building a design that will grow with your unique business?
Other aspects to consider: how long will it take to complete your project? How often will they share progress with you? And how do you get in contact with them to discuss the project?
5. Do you have any questions for me?
Lastly, ask the designer if they have any questions for you. Working with a designer is a lot like getting a haircut. The more information you can give them before they start the design process, the better the outcome—especially if you have a vision in mind for what you want your brand to convey. There might also be information a designer needs to know before they decide if they want to work with you. Their reputation is at stake when they take on a new client! Answer anything they ask and provide as much information as you can.

news_381,news,Enterprise behavior: Reduce the cost of employee onboarding,"With employee turnover rates soaring this year, businesses need to focus on streamlining their recruitment and onboarding processes—or risk losing serious money. Here are 9 strategies for reducing the costs of finding and onboarding new employees.  …",12-07-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-reduce-the-cost-of-employee-on-boarding/,"Onboarding new employees can be an unexpected drain on your profits. In addition to standard recruitment costs, there are hidden costs including the time supervisors (and the new employee) spend on on-the-job training, doing mandatory paperwork, deferred productivity while the new hire gets up to speed, and costs of more formal training if needed. Then there are the costs of materials such as card keys, branded clothes or uniforms, and software licenses. These costs add up, and according to some experts, can cost an average of $4,000 per hire. If the new hire leaves before staying a full year, those costs are lost. With a little organization and research, you can reduce your onboarding expenses: Here are 9 strategies to get you started:
1. Promote from within.
Managers need a high level of institutional knowledge to be successful. Replacing and training lower-level employees, on the other hand, is often easier and more cost effective. When there’s a vacancy, consider moving up someone already entrenched in the business and brand and work to onboard an entry-level position.
2. Schedule “face-time.”
Some researchers estimate that interruptions and information overload cost companies 28 billion wasted hours a year. New hires have a lot of questions, and the constant interruptions really add up to lost productivity for the whole team. One way to respond adequately to questions without letting them hijack the team is to schedule regular check-ins. Employees can save their questions or concerns until their scheduled meeting instead of interrupting your work flow constantly.
3. Set up mentors.
Break up the task of onboarding a new employee by arranging mentors in specific activities. Then schedule time with these mentors when the mentor is likely to be in a slower period. This helps make their “downtime” more productive and onboards your new employee faster. It also helps them establish a network of specialists they can interface with as they grow into their role.
4. Combine start dates.
When possible, have new hires start at the same time. It’s a simple idea, but often overlooked. You’ll get more value out of the time you spend training by training multiple employees at once.
5. Take advantage of free tutorials.
Some training courses are available for free. For example, customer service tutorials and sexual harassment prevention workshops may be readily available on on YouTube. Other training may be available for free through your local library, sometimes using outside sources like Lynda.com. Also ask your vendors about their resources. Clover, for example, has free support for learning the most common tasks employees perform on Clover devices.
6. Create your own tutorials, checklists, and other training.
If you find that you have high turnover at low-level jobs, think about creating self-guided tutorials for entry-level employees that can be used anytime someone new joins the team. Work on making them fun and personal so that the process isn’t too dry. Tutorials about your brand can be filmed on your cell phone or laptop. Or you can use screencasting tools to create tutorials that require you to demonstrate specific uses of software.
7. Streamline and automate your training.
Once you have a good sense of what you need new hires to learn, it’s important to organize the materials. What should new hires know before stepping out onto the floor? What topics, such as safety and security, should be prioritized? Who are the best people to train them? Will you spend the entire first day training, or will you break it up over a week? If you’re splitting the task of training, provide your trainers with checklists of topics you want them to cover.
8. Offer an employee referral program.
Got great talent? Chances are, your best employees know others who might be fantastic new hires. Having a referral program helps cut recruitment costs, motivates employees to make the workplace more fun, and incentivizes them to onboard new hires well. (They don’t get paid until the new hire reaches a specified anniversary.)
9. Retain your best talent.
This isn’t an onboarding tip per se, but it’s important to remember that if you do a good job retaining talent, you don’t need to spend as much on onboarding. According to research, the average separation rate for retail is 59% and fast food is even higher at 100%. Some estimates put restaurant separation rates at 150%. That means if the restaurant has 20 employees, they can expect to have to hire 30 in a one-year period due to employee departures. Keeping employees happy can really save you money in the long term and reduce your recruiting/onboarding costs.

news_384,news,Business accelerators: Leveraging staff expertise to drive more sales,"Employees often bring passion, expertise, and fascinating life experiences—great for personalizing the business and reaching customers. Learn simple strategies for mining the staff’s insights and skills, and using the information to increase sales.
…",23-07-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-leveraging-staff-expertise-to-drive-more-sales/,"When you’re in charge of a small business, you have the final word on products, customer service, marketing, financials, and everything else. But the best decisions are often made with input from others.
For expert help, look no further than the staff on the frontline. They’re constantly interacting with customers, and see what works and what doesn’t. They’re often passionate about the products or services. Many might even have prior work experiences that offer a window into competitors’ practices.
All of this adds up to a goldmine of knowledge about improving the business and moving more products. In this post, we look at simple strategies to leverage your staff’s insights and skills into more sales.
Locate the stars on the team.
Whether through better questions, a tailored sales pitch, or just exhibiting the right attitude, the top sellers know how to engage customers and get them to act. Sometimes it’s obvious who lands the most sales, but not always. A POS system removes the guesswork—if you know how to access the data.
For Clover users, the first step is to set up systems that let you to see how merchandise moves and who moves it the quickest. To do this, start by creating labels for each inventory item:

Open the Inventory app
Click Labels
Click + Add New Label to create a new label, or click the Pencil icon to edit an existing label
Select the Show Label in Reports checkbox
Click Save

Next, find out how well an employee is selling a particular item by visiting the Clover Web Dashboard > Reporting app > Employees. Alternatively, locate a breakdown of items sold during individual employee shifts on the “shift details” screen, which can be found when viewing an individual shift in the Shifts app.
Gather their insights and skills.
Once top employees have been identified, it’s time to set up meetings to regularly cull and share their knowledge.
Hyper-focused staff meetings are a great option. Even if the team has to huddle before opening, a quick discussion of tips and ideas can get everyone working more effectively. Or, expand on the meeting format and host an inexpensive outing or overnight retreat—both memorable ways to galvanize the team and activate learning.
Whatever the venue, the goal is to find out what the best employees are doing right. Ask them to talk about their sales techniques. Do they remember names, ask questions, and use the answers to make recommendations? Do they have deep knowledge about the products, or a particularly good way to articulate its benefits?
Get employees to role-play being customers, and let the sales wizard show them the ropes. Simulating real-life scenarios makes sales pitches, product knowledge, and even insights into the customer more immediate and actionable.
Spotlight their expert knowledge.
Employees, of course, aren’t just warm bodies assigned to tasks. They’re the face of the business, with the power to drive or stall sales. What about introducing staff members on the website, emails, social media, or special events? Humanizing the people behind the counter adds a personal element to the business and builds bridges to customers.
Merchants might feature employee book recommendations to help customers discover new authors and to trigger more sales. Kitchen supply stores could host cooking classes that tap an employee’s expertise and engage customers in an immersive experience. An outdoor store might profile an employee who scaled Mt. Kilimanjaro, or a restaurant could highlight the chef working magic behind the scenes.
Stay connected with your people. You might be surprised how many possess expert knowledge and amazing experiences that can grab customers’ attention.
Give employees tools to sell even more.
Have you heard of customer personas? In bigger companies, the marketing and creative people put together detailed profiles of customer types, often with photos and biographical details. The goal is to create a unified vision of who is coming through the door, what they’re seeking, and how to better serve them.
Personas can work for smaller establishments as well. Instead of plastering the office with fictitious profiles, encourage staff to brainstorm a handful of personality types that frequent the business. Flesh out the personas with specifics, such as:

Who they are: Their age, education, location, income, and family size
Why they choose your business: Their immediate needs and interests
What they hope to get out of the experience: A place to celebrate, an affordable meal, great advice on flattering hairstyles, or anything else

Once employees have a feel for customers, they can tailor their advice to the persona they’re encountering. Knowing a customer’s needs and mindset can help staff deliver an outstanding customer experience and close the sale.
There are many ways to tap, boost, and leverage employees’ knowledge and skills. Try out a few and reap the benefits of a more personal brand experience and accelerated business growth.

news_385,news,Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): How to calculate it & why it matters,"Customer Lifetime Value is one of the most important—and overlooked—small business metrics that impacts profits and helps shape your marketing budget. Find out how to calculate and maximize the amount of money your customers spend at your business in their lifetime. 
…",26-07-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/customer-lifetime-value-ltv-how-to-calculate-it-why-it-matters/,"Click or tap to download the Customer Lifetime Value worksheet.
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is one of the most important—and overlooked—small business metrics that impacts profits and helps shape your marketing budget and strategy. Simply defined, customer LTV is the amount of money a customer will spend at your business in their lifetime.
Too many businesses funnel money toward trying to acquire new customers, and focus on what’s far more important—retaining customers. After all, keeping an existing customer costs significantly less than the cost of acquiring a new one. Why? It’s easier to sell to existing customers who already have a relationship with your business. Selling to a complete newbie requires much more effort just to get them in the door. So once you do get a new person in the door, it’s better to spend your time and money on retaining them.
Consider this: A mere five percent uptick in customer loyalty can boost profits by as much as 95 percent, according to Harvard Business School. Your regulars are not only more inclined to try new products, they also spend more per transaction than new customers. You are 60 to 70 percent more likely to sell to an existing customer, compared to the low 5 to 20 percent probability of selling to a newbie. In other words, your profits will benefit when you stay faithful to the faithful.

How do I identify LTV?
There are a number of methods for calculating this metric, but here’s one:
Average customer LTV = Average customer value per year ? average customer lifespan
More specifically:
Average customer LTV = Average customer value per year (visits per month ? average spent per visit ? 12) ? average customer lifespan.
Let’s apply this equation to a real-life scenario. Imagine you run a popular neighborhood bar and grill that caters to 20-somethings. Your average customer drops by the bar twice a month and spends about $30 per visit on drinks and food.
Average customer value per year = 2 visits per month ? $30 spent per visit ? 12 months = $720
Average customer lifespan = 10 years
Average customer LTV = $720 ? 10 = $7,200
This figure gives you the big-picture view of how much the average customer spends in their lifetime, and it helps guide your marketing decisions. For example, it’d be a waste to spend $8,000 on advertising if it only leads to one new customer. On the other hand, if you spend $100 to acquire a new customer and they only spend $60 that first month, don’t consider this a loss; remember their lifetime value is around $7,200. Focus on keeping these customers happy and returning for more.
Interested in boosting your customer LTV? Bump up any of the numbers in this equation. Here’s how.

1. Bump up the amount spent per visit
Find creative ways to increase your average customer’s amount spent per visit. Going back to the bar and grill example, if this figure increased by even $5, you’re looking at a $1,200 increase in your average customer LTV.
2 visits per month x $35 spent per visit x 12 months x 10 years = $8,400
This makes for a more than 16 percent boost in average customer LTV. So how do you squeeze out that extra amount per visit?
Cater to your customers
To achieve this boost, you’ll need to learn about your customers and personalize your offerings to their tastes. Strike up conversations, offer discounts for filling out a survey or connect over social media so you can get to know them, and offer relevant products to them. Maybe they’re willing to pay a premium for craft beers or organic grass-fed burgers.
Get the word out
Great marketing and on-point communication is key to making these personalized touches a hit. If your customers don’t know about it, they won’t shell out the extra green for it. Be sure to highlight these items in your product marketing, whether that’s through your email list, a snazzy social media campaign, the signage outside your establishment, or something your staff hypes.

2. Increase frequency of visits.
In addition to boosting the amount spent per visit, you can also increase customer LTV by increasing the number of visits customers make. The key is cultivating such a positive relationship with them that they want to come back for more, much more.
Returning to our bar and grill example, let’s say you’re able to get your customers through the door for one extra visit every other month. So, for the sake of working from the original equation, they go from visiting 2 times per month to 2.5 times per month, and they still spend about $30 per visit. Here’s how that bumps up your average customer LTV.
2.5 visits per month x $30 spent per visit x 12 months x 10 years = $9,000
You’ve just raised your average customer LTV by $1,800, or 25 percent.
Let’s dig into strategies that can help you reach this goal.
Engage and re-engage
Again, understanding and communicating with your customers is key to building brand loyalty. Maybe you run a restaurant that your customers love, but they’re too busy to come in for more sit down meals. Consider offering takeout, delivery, or online ordering—these are great ways to get extra sales and retain loyal customers. (Here are some tips for doing this successfully.) You can also offer loyalty programs like Clover Rewards, which can incentivize customers who already love your products to come back more frequently.
Make it easy
No matter your field of business, it’s important to remove obstacles that stand between your customer’s initial interest and the close of their sale. Make spending money at your business easy by giving customers the best user experience and top-notch service. For example, if you’re a restaurant that serves the professional lunch crowd, make it easy to split the bill among groups. Serving food that’s suitable for a quick mid-day meal and streamlining the customer experience will go a long way towards developing more loyalty.

news_387,news,Growing pains: Finding a mentor to navigate a business growth spurt,"When it’s time to grow the business, mentors bring a wealth of information and experience. But how do you persuade someone to commit to your business? Learn simple strategies for landing a knowledgeable mentor and getting the most from the relationship.
…",02-08-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-finding-a-mentor-to-navigate-a-business-growth-spurt/,"Getting a business off the ground is a massive undertaking with a steep learning curve. Once scaled, the next goal becomes clear: taking the business in new directions or opening new locations. But growth comes with its own set of challenges.
That’s where mentors can help. Mentors bring a wealth of real-life experience, including tips for scaling up a business and advice for sidestepping pitfalls. So where do you locate these wise advisors? And how do you convince them to join your team?
This post will demystify the process of getting mentors to help grow your business.
Figure out where you need help.
The first step is to break down your needs into the smallest possible chunks. That way you have a clear idea about what you want to learn from a mentor, rather than bombarding him or her with requests.
Next, prepare a set of specific questions you need answered. If the questions are hitting a variety of areas, consider tapping more than one mentor. After all, no one has all the answers, and no one can fix every problem.
For example, one person may be a well-connected insider who can help expand your network and make new connections. Others may be operational gurus who can help improve business practices. Still other mentors may be product experts who can advise you on offerings.
Cast a wide net.
Mentors can come from anywhere. They can be a known player who’s been featured in a local business magazine, or a fellow small business owner working several stores over. They can be friends of friends, acquaintances from a seminar, or someone you reached out to on social media.
The more people in your network pool, the more likely you can find willing participants. Beyond friends and family, some common sources for finding mentors include:

Networking events: Make sure you’re not hugging the wall, but actually mingling and talking to new people.
Social media: Try to turn digital connections on LinkedIn, Twitter, and other networks into real-world relationships.
SBDCs: Locate a Small Business Development Center in your area and check out their free advice, workshops, and seminars.
Mentor services: Search for mentors through SCORE, a volunteer organization that lets you meet retired executives via email, video chat, or face-to-face.
Industry expos: Talk with featured guests and other attendees—anyone with a proven track record in related industries.
Your community: Tap groups you already belong to, such as faith communities, PTA organizations, LGBTQ groups, or networks of women or minority entrepreneurs.

Uncover promising prospects.
Most mentors aren’t signing up for a paid gig doling out constant counseling. Mentoring is more about forging organic relationships to bounce ideas around, seek advice about specific issues, or share concerns.
Let the relationship develop naturally. While it might grow into a close bond that involves regular dinner and coffee meet-ups, mentors can also be more casual acquaintances to contact only sporadically. Both options can work, but be prepared to let the mentor decide the terms.
Whether the mentorship is ongoing or occasional, look for great personal qualities, not just big titles. Valuable mentors are honest, transparent, giving, and reliable. As you approach people and ask them for guidance, keep some of these bedrock traits in mind.
Ask in ways they can’t refuse.
Modern life can be a pressure cooker, as people juggle families and nonstop work. To increase your chances of landing a reliable mentor, find ways to reduce the pressure.
Pinpoint specific areas that don’t require huge time commitments. Show enthusiasm and gratitude to the potential mentor, and never be pushy. Let relationships develop, while subtly staying on top of contacting them and meeting up regularly.
Flexibility is good too. Many people won’t want to commit to dinner or even coffee, but are happy to offer valuable advice—as long it’s quick. Consider mentors you can email with quick questions and count on for timely, on-target replies.
Or, find a mentor who is also running a small business. As long as you’re not direct competitors, a peer can be great for sharing tactics for expanding the business. These mutually beneficial relationships can also be the most lasting.
The mad scramble to get up and profitably running is behind you. For your next steps in this incredible journey, find a mentor to help troubleshoot problems and steer you in the right direction.

news_388,news,Enterprise behavior: What VIP customer feedback can tell you,"Even small-ticket customers can be some of the most loyal, profitable—and insightful. Find out simple ways to recognize and reward them, and to tap their ideas for improving and growing your small business.
…",07-08-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-what-vip-customer-feedback-can-tell-you/,"The best customers are economic engines. They’re reliable, loyal, and help small businesses clear a profit each month.
But what many people don’t realize are that these customers aren’t always the splashy spenders. They’re often the ones who come back consistently, even if their purchases are small.
Consider the case of the “$5.35 guy,” a Portland native whose daily brew and bagel contribute as much to a coffee shop’s bottom line as 10 occasional customers. These are the people every business owner should recognize, reward, and reach out to for their insights.
Learn about a few easy ways to both keep VIP customers coming back and tapping their experiences for fresh ideas.
Use a personal touch.
Everyone likes being recognized and known. In the old days, sole proprietors might personally greet the locals who passed through their doors. They would know names, buying histories, and what the person might be interested in considering.
But competitive operations today are often more complex operations. They require more staff, more distribution channels, and more time spent on tasks such as marketing, building an online presence, and cultivating loyalty among customers who have a sea of options.
Reward programs help forge a vital personal relationship between the business and its VIP customers. While punch cards were a small-business standby, new POS systems make it easy to set up digital rewards programs that actually gather customer and purchase data.
Clover Rewards, for example, lets staff identify customers and greet them by name. If the customer places a regular order, employees will see that too and be able to act quickly. Apps can be used to tailor offers that appeal to customers’ habits, including discounted versions of their favorite items—all time-tested tactics that customers still deeply appreciate.
Solicit their feedback.
While greetings and rewards help customers feel seen and valued, these VIPs are more than just cash cows. They can actually tell you a lot about the business and offer ideas to expand and boost sales. All it takes is asking questions.
For starters, always ask if customers found what they needed and if there’s anything more you can help them with. If a customer is receptive, go further with your questions and try to discover unspoken needs.
For example, VIPs might love your offerings—otherwise they wouldn’t be so loyal. But they might also enjoy more variety. Ask if there are new items they’d like to see on the menu, or regular specials or regional cuisines they’d like to try. What about different styles in a clothing shop or brands in a pet store?
Start a conversation about the establishment’s hours. Would customers like special access that’s earlier or later than normal hours? Would extended weekend hours work better with their schedules? If there’s a real chance of capturing more business, adding hours for VIPs might be a good option.
Or, what about bringing your VIPs into the establishment—literally. Would they enjoy using the space for an office party or a private event? Or, maybe you can switch the scenario and bring services to the customers. A spa might offer modified services at a customer’s workplace, or a restaurant could offer to cater a customer’s party.
Help them connect with you.
Just as merchants should regularly contact their best customers with rewards and notifications, customers should be able to contact the business as well.
Whether they have a complaint, a suggestion, or want to pass along a compliment, give them a way to privately reach you. Consider setting up a dedicated email expressly for VIP customers. That way their messages won’t get lost in the avalanche of business communications, and merchants can be sure to reply personally.
Another option is Clover’s Feedback app, which lets you invite customers to connect with you via your POS system. It’s not only a great way to stay in touch, but also to contain criticism. Letting people vent directly to the business can prevent angry reviews from reaching the public eye.
Repeat customers spend 67% more than new customers, and second-time customers refer an average of three people to the business. These VIP customers are truly the lifeblood of the business, driving sales and sparking ideas.
With a few simple strategies, small business owners can recognize them, reward them, and gather their input to steadily grow and improve.

news_390,news,5 questions to ask before borrowing money for your business,"As you launch and grow your business it’s inevitable that you’ll need extra cash to deal with the unexpected. Here are 5 questions to calmly ask yourself before borrowing money for your business.
…",08-08-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-before-borrowing-money-for-your-business/,"As you launch and grow your business it’s inevitable that you’ll need extra cash to deal with the unexpected. Choosing to borrow money often comes with a hefty dose of anxiety about quickly making the right decision. Don’t give in to that panic! Here are 5 questions to calmly ask yourself before borrowing money for your business:
1. Why do I need the money?
It’s important to take a breath and allow yourself a moment to clearly assess the situation. Just because something seems like a great opportunity doesn’t mean that it actually is. Alternatively, if you’re attempting to fix pre-existing financial problems, more debt might not be the right solution. The key is to take time to analyze the details surrounding your circumstances and consider all of your options. Securing a loan should support activities that aid in the long-term health of your company.
2. How much can I afford to safely borrow?
Let’s say you’re finally building out the backyard of your restaurant. You may have high hopes of recreating Tavern on the Green in your hometown, but your budget might only allow for simpler plans. Figure out your means by calculating your Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR). Think of it as a way to measure “cash in” against “cash out.”
In a nutshell, you simply take your annual net operating income (EBITDA, or “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization”) and divide it by what your annual debt payments would be, including the loan in question.
DSCR = EBITDA ÷ Annual Debt Payments
A DSCR of 1 means that you’re breaking even and you might want to reconsider borrowing money. A DSCR of 1.5 means the business has 50% more incoming cash flow than needed to cover the payments of your debt, which could be a good sign.
3. When do I need the funds?
As with many things in life, when it comes to loans, timing is everything. Once you’ve confirmed that a loan is the right option, you’ll want to schedule the loan so the funds are deposited just ahead of when you plan to use the money. Consider the lead time required to complete the application process of whichever option you choose to pursue. Take advantage of any extra time you might have and apply for a bank loan. They’re generally cheaper, but the tradeoff is that the application process tends to be more involved. If you need funds right away, you could consider a term loan from an online lender. Again, proceed with caution. In many instances you’ll pay a higher rate to cover the risk as well as the convenience. If you’re looking for a clever alternative you might want to try Clover Capital, which could place cash into your account in as little as 3-5 business days.
4. Debt or equity, which is right for me?
When it comes to borrowing, it may seem that there are just as many options to finance your business as there are reasons to need the funds. If the funds you plan to borrow are intended to capitalize on new opportunities available to your business, then you may want to consider equity financing. This is where you sell shares to investors who also see the level of potential for your business. While working with investors may expand your support system to include seasoned professionals, you also open yourself up to paying those investors in perpetuity. With traditional loans, once your obligation has been fulfilled, all remaining profit is yours.
5. How easy is the process from start to finish?
The administrative tasks associated with loans can be overwhelming to the unsuspecting borrower. For example, there’s the extensive list of documents a lender may require as part of your application package. Be ready to supply as many as 20 items supporting your case. A way around this is to explore options offered by companies with which you already have a relationship. Much of your info is already on file. Work with your account manager to help guide you through the rest of the requirements.
Once you’ve been approved for the loan, how easy is it to incorporate the payments into your monthly accounting? The great thing about Clover Capital is that a small percentage of your daily credit card sales are automatically withheld to repay your cash advance. It truly is a “set it and forget it” solution. Plus, once approved, you have the opportunity to renew your cash advance for additional funds.
Remember, don’t let the pressures associated with your reasons for borrowing money cloud your thinking and impair your judgement. Take an honest look at your circumstances and focus on making the most responsible decision for your business.

Taking great photos doesn’t require a professional eye—or even a fancy camera. Own Instagram with these tips to capture the moment, build your followers, and share what makes your business shine.  
…",09-08-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/design-for-better-business-7-tips-for-taking-killer-instagram-photos-to-build-your-social-media-following/,"Let’s talk Instagram. In the past, we’ve outlined how to start and build an Instagram page that gives you big bang for your buck. Today, we’re covering content. What should go on your Instagram feed, and how can show off your business’s best side?
Taking great product photos doesn’t require a professional eye—or even a fancy camera. Retailers, restaurants, bars, and salons can own Instagram with little-to-no design background. Follow these tips to recognize Insta-ready photos in the making, capture the moment, build your followers, and share what makes your business shine.
1. Know the basics of your phone settings.
It doesn’t take a fancy camera to fill your feed with amazing photos. If you have a smartphone, there are a few key tricks that can help you make the most of your existing camera settings.

Don’t shoot in square setting. Though Instagram will automatically crop your photo to square, take your photo in landscape or portrait view before cropping. This saves pixels and gives you some options for composition.
Take advantage of HDR. If you have a Samsung Galaxy 4, an iPhone 4s, or any newer smartphone, then your phone has a built in high-dynamic range setting. Use this setting when trying to capture portraits in sunlight or low and back-lit scenes.
Avoid digital zoom. A phone’s lens doesn’t do much for taking pictures at a distance, so either get closer or take a wider photo and crop later.
Adjust your exposure. If you tap the screen while setting up a photo, iPhones will give you an option to play with the light settings. Slide your finger to adjust the exposure: higher exposure lets more light into the lens, giving you a brighter, more vibrant photo.

If you want to get even more advanced, there are all kinds of options to be found in your camera settings. Some people like to have a grid overlay to line up a product or center their photo correctly. Others prefer to save disk space and turn HDR off. Play around to see what works best for you!
2. Pay attention to the lighting.
Foodies know that a mouth-watering Instagram makes the most of natural light. Natural light shows subtle detail in a photo that a flash can’t capture. So, if you’re trying to show a new dish or highlight ingredients on your seasonal menu, get near a window or even take it outside! The pros also suggest highlighting shadowed parts using white poster board: have someone hold the board so the dish sits between the window and the poster board, thus reflecting light on to the dish.


3. Try an editing app.
Instagram already comes with its own great filters, but if you really want to make your feed pop, use a quick editing tool on your phone. We like Snapseed because it’s user-friendly, free, and allows you to save your previous settings. You can also try VSCO or Afterlight for easy-to-use editing tools, filters, and more. These tools take some of the pressure of capturing the perfect shot and allow you to develop a consistent style throughout your Instagram feed.


4. Play with flatlays.
Flatlays are essential for stellar product photography. For retailers, mixing in flatlays can help you create a mood, show off your brand’s personality, and give inspiration to potential shoppers. Flatlays are photo collages of objects on a flat surface. Cafes and restaurants can use a flatlay to show off menu items on a table spread. Fashion brands can inspire outfits of the day or upsell accessories by putting together different looks. Get creative with colors and textures, but try to use a neutral background and good lighting to make your flatlay look professional.


5. Tell a story with your content.
The most interesting Instagram pages mix up their formats. Intersperse your flatlays with reviews, quotes, or thank-you notes from customers, video, and lifestyle photos.
Lifestyle content gives you a chance to show off your business’s personality. This content can be a little more complicated than a typical flatlay, but it is absolutely worthwhile to tell a story about your brand. This type of content is aspirational; it doesn’t always feature your product, or even mention your shop. But, it does give you a chance to connect with your customers by showing you understand their needs, wants and desires. Think about these questions when posting a lifestyle photo:

What does your customer like to do for fun?
Where do they shop, and who do they admire?
What’s important to them?
What routines do they regularly engage in?

Overall, try to use this content to allow your customers to envision how they will enjoy your product or service.


6. Mix it up!
As we alluded to in the last point, mix up the format and style of your page to give it some serious energy! Beyond telling a story through lifestyle photos and product highlights, use customer quotes, reviews, and referrals to build your brand. Word-of-mouth marketing is a powerful tool, and you can capture some of that magic using a quote generator app like InstaQuote or WordSwag.
You can also use an app like Boomerang to add some zing to your feed. Boomerang combines images into a mini video that loops endlessly. It’s kind of like a GIF, but very easy to use! Ask your bartender to make a drink while you Boomerang their artistry, or show off a customer’s new blow-out with a Boomerang hair-flip. Livening up your feed could not be easier.


7. Do a before and after.
Sure, some small businesses might not seem very Instagram friendly. If you run a service—like a lawn care service or spa—before and after photos are going to be your bread and butter (shampoo and conditioner?). With a customer’s permission, show your results. From a good home renovation to a beautiful wedding up-do, there’s nothing more visually satisfying than a job done well.


Make the most of your Instagram feed without spending a lot of time or resources on professional photography. It’s all in the creativity and passion you already have for promoting your business!

Prepaid
Who isn’t looking for easy ways to bump up their cash intake? Prepaid by Blackstone Calling Card is an easy way to do so. Let your customers know that in addition to their normal transactions with you, they can purchase or top up calling cards and prepaid wireless phones. This includes brands like AT&T Prepaid, Boost, T-Mobile, Metro PCS, and Verizon Prepaid. They can even recharge international phones for their friends and relatives!
But Prepaid isn’t just for phones. It can also be used to pay bills, with over 7,000 national and local billers to choose from. Users can pay their power and gas suppliers, local home phone service, credit cards, internet service providers, and even toll passes like SunPass, Fastrak, MassDot, and EZPass.
You don’t need any inventory to start selling these services, so there’s no investment up front. And as a Clover merchant, you’ll get a commission on every sale.
Nav
Do you use Credit Karma or another reporting service to track your personal credit score and reports? The new Nav Business Credit Dashboard serves the same purpose, but for your business.
Having great business credit is crucial to securing funding, so it’s important to keep an eye on it. With Nav, you’ll have instant access to your Experian business credit score and report as well as the same information from Dun & Bradstreet.

AP Intego
Ensuring your business’ longevity requires more than just boosting your income and protecting your credit score. You also have to make sure that you protect your assets! AP Intego is a new app that addresses the major problem of uninsured or underinsured small businesses.

news_394,news,8 ways your business bleeds cash (& how to stop the flow),"Log into your bank account or open the till at the end of the day, and see less cash than you expected? Your business may be hemorrhaging money. To help stop the bleed, peruse these 8 tips for managing cash flow and making better financial decisions.
…",15-08-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/where-are-you-bleeding-cash-maximize-your-profitability-by-changing-your-perspective/,"Can you relate to any of these scenarios?

Every time you log into your bank account, there’s less and less of it.
Every time you open the till at the end of the day, you expect more than you find.
Every time you sit down to pay bills, you puzzle over who gets paid on time.

If you find yourself regularly wondering, “Where’s the cash?” then your business may be hemorrhaging money.
According to one study, poor understanding of cash flow or poor cash flow management is a major reason many small businesses fail. The big question is why, and the big task is to stop the bleeding before it stops your business.  Cash management is, at its simplest, knowing what cash is flowing into your business and what cash is flowing out and it’s one of the toughest challenges many small business owners face is juggling finances while keeping their businesses open and running every day.
To help, we’ve put together 8 tips for gaining the visibility you need to manage your cash flow and make better financial decisions.
1. Stay on top of invoices.
In survival mode, it’s easy to let invoicing slip. Why not? A few days won’t matter, and your customers are good for it, right? The problem is, if money’s not coming in on time, you may lose track of what’s due you. Worse, you may not be able to pay your bills on time. And that puts your business in jeopardy. Here’s a checklist to keep invoicing on-track:

Keep a schedule. Pick a time each week or month for invoicing, and stick to it.
Confirm contact names and addresses. Make sure you have the correct customer contact name and address for your invoice. Delayed invoices mean delayed cash inflow.
Provide clear explanations. Make sure your invoices provide a clear explanation of services and charges—especially any add-on fees. The more questions you answer up-front for customers, the speedier the payment process.
Note terms of late payment. Whether it’s a 3% or 10% penalty for late payments, noting penalties for late payments incentivizes customers to pay on time.
Offer clear and simple payment options. Writing a check and putting it in the mail may work for some customers but not for others. The easier you make it for customers to pay you, the more likely it is you’ll get your money on time.
Brand your invoices. Clearly identify who’s sending the invoice. Consider invoices yet another opportunity to build your brand with customers.
Choose your tools. InvoiceASAP works with Clover devices, most mobile devices and computers to create professional invoices and accept credit card payments. You can also check out InvoiceAble.

2. Pay bills on time.
Not staying on top of bills or credit card payments can mean incurring fees, interest, or fines. That’s especially true for sales tax.
In a recent conversation with David Joseph, former restaurateur and tech company cofounder, he shared that a surprise $9,000 sales tax bill from his bookkeeper caused him to ask: “Why can’t someone do our sales tax the way ADP does our payroll?” That’s how he conceived a tool that helps restaurant owners sleep at night and launched his tech business: DAVO.
DAVO for sales tax automatically collects daily sales tax, holds it securely, then files and pays it in full and on time. No more surprise sales tax bills or late penalties.
“It’s automated,” Joseph said. “The Clover [app] calculates sales tax. It sends us the sales data. All of that is done automatically, and what we really do is cash management.… We put a little bit of money aside every day.”
To help restaurants capture vendor bills, Sourcing Club syncs daily sales report from your Clover device to QuickBooks, helps businesses capture pictures of vendor bills, and moves those pics into QuickBooks. Although it doesn’t address inventory, it’s an easy way to track invoices—and it’s free.
3 Reduce cash handling.
Every time cash changes hands at your business, there’s potential for error. But tracking cash can be a time-consuming job, particularly for retail businesses.
To help businesses track cash, Clover offers two apps:

Cash Log, a free Clover app, is especially helpful in retail where cash regularly changes hands. This app tracks all customer cash transactions and manager cash drawer activities to spotlight cash movement.
Cash Track records cash movement from employees or registers and sends daily shift reports by email or to your Clover dashboard. It even helps restaurants calculate tips.

And these apps help minimize the need to handle cash:

CoinOut is a digital change handler that lets customers receive and save change from a transaction digitally and get cash back to spend with your business. Or, they can take a picture of their receipt to earn cash back.
Donate at Checkout lets you collect donations at the end of a customer transaction for a charity of choice. With preset amounts for donations and a Round Up feature, you can access reports on donations received from its online portal.

4. Nail your staffing needs.
Over-staffing can mean spending cash on resources you may not need. But under-staffing can mean lost sales. And no-shows can spell disaster. How do you strike the right balance between having too many hands on-deck and too few? You observe, chart, map, schedule, and publicize.

Calculate. Calculate your average hourly/daily transactions. Check out #3 in this post. Tip: For hourly transactions, substitute “total hours” instead of “total days” in measurement period.
Track. Track your customer traffic and proceeds by day and hour. That can provide a visual of your overall traffic flow and can be a helpful indicator of when you need extra hands. Be sure to note how flows change on weekends, holidays, and seasonally.
Map. Now, figure out how many customers or transactions one resource can handle at a time or in increments of time, like an hour. Compare that number to your traffic for a sense of how many hands you may need to accommodate customers.
Schedule. Build a schedule that maps employees to your anticipated flow of traffic and income. Always have a back-up plan for no-shows, and a clearly-defined way for employees to request changes to the schedule, when needed.
Publicize. Employees who show up are the hands of your business, so spend time making sure employees know what the schedule is, where to find it and how to handle changes should the unexpected happen.

A great tool to help manage your team is Homebase. With mobile apps, time clock and scheduling tools, Homebase also offers a variety of employee management tools, like automatic shift reminders.
5 Preserve perishable inventory.
For retail or product-focused businesses, inventory management is one of the most important tasks they face—and one that can mean lost cash if mishandled. For businesses in the food and drink industry, spoiled inventory is a major cash risk.
“The problem in the restaurant business,” said David Joseph, “is that if you ask most chefs and most owners, ‘So what’s your food cost right now? What are you paying for food? What’s the percentage of your total?’ [they respond], ‘Well last month, it was like 34 percent.’ Last month? You should be doing that every single day.”
These apps help businesses manage perishable inventories:

Recipe Keeper helps you track the stock you have on-hand for various dishes or recipes. Simply download the app and map your recipes to ingredients. As you sell your goods, the app tracks your stock, minimizing waste and manual inventory errors.
Bottle Keeper lets you determine exactly how much liquid stock you have in inventory. Perfect for bars, restaurants, vape stores, salons, or liquor stores. You can even save recipes and track ingredients with every sale.
One Click Reorder is ideal for food-service businesses like pizza shops. Offering a popup that displays a customer’s order history, this tool is a perfect upsell tool and gives businesses insight into customer preferences.

6. Freeze fraud in its tracks.
Many businesses, especially retail businesses, can lose track of cash through fraud. A payment, refund, tip, or discount exceeds a specified amount. A completed transaction gets deleted, and the cash gets pocketed. Cash goes missing from a cash drawer, or the cash drawer opens without a transaction. It’s traditionally been tough to track those kinds of tactics.
Fortunately, new tools like Ping Me If can help. Focused on fraud deterrence, Ping Me If provides email or text notifications when these kinds of events happen in your business.
7. Know your KPIs.
As David Joseph said: “A restaurateur once said to me, ‘The most expensive seat in a restaurant is the empty one, because it’s costing you. It’s not bringing you money. It costs’.”
One of the most difficult mindset shifts small businesses have to make if they want to thrive and grow is understanding how to measure the health of the business. Restaurants, for example, have certain fixed costs: whether it has all seats filled or just a couple, the owners still pay rent.
Unfortunately, many businesses experience cash bleedout because they don’t have a pulse on these 9 numbers that matter. From profit margin and average ticket size to cost of acquiring new customers and conversion rates, these numbers, also called Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can lead businesses to better financial management. In fact, understanding these KPIs is crucial to businesses conducting analysis that results in pricing their products more profitably.
8. Plan for unplanned expenses.
Not planning for the unexpected definitely impedes cash flow. To help small businesses plan for unplanned events, like a fridge that’s on the fritz or a heater that stops heating, DAVO creator David Joseph and team designed two products that put saving on autopilot: Savings Club and Sweep and Save.
“How many times do restaurants say, ‘Oh, the air conditioner broke. The refrigerator broke,’ you know?” Joseph asked. “If you put aside $20 a day, at the end of the year, you’re gonna have somewhere around $7,000.”

Savings Club, an annual savings tool, automatically collects funds each day and returns them to you mid-December for year-end expenses.
Sweep and Save pulls a percentage of daily sales out for monthly expenses and gives it back to you on the first day of the next month.

Not stopping the cash bleed leads many businesses every year to close their doors. But with due diligence, planning and a few helpful tools, it’s not only possible to stop the bleed, but improve the overall health and outlook of a business.

news_395,news,Business accelerators: How mobile coupons can boost foot traffic & drive sales,"Everyone loves a bargain. That fact doesn’t change. What does change is the way people choose to collect, store and redeem coupons. Now that smartphones are the norm, it’s time to take the next step in the evolution of coupons.
…",21-08-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-how-mobile-coupons-can-boost-foot-traffic-drive-sales/,"The coupon is a handy marketing tactic that dates back to the late 1800s and is still a staple in attracting and keeping customers. What started out as a paper-based communication has consistently reinvented itself. Everyone loves a bargain. That fact doesn’t change. What does change is the way people choose to collect, store, and redeem coupons. These little paper clippings have consistently reinvented themselves through newspaper, direct mail, and most recently, e-commerce sites like Groupon. The next step in the evolution of coupons is Mobile.
“Mobile coupons” are limited-time offers sent directly to customer phones. They are now on par with their paper counterparts as a preferred way to receive special offers. In fact, it is estimated that over 139 million adults will use digital coupons in 2019 alone.
Put the deals where their eyes are.
Consider these stats:

95% of Americans own a cellphone of some kind.
77% of those who own a cellphone have a smartphone.
94% of Americans age 18 – 29 have a smartphone.
1 in 5 Americans access the internet exclusively through a smartphone.

Smartphones have changed the way people receive communications from simple SMS texting to email and even social. The best coupon apps make it easy to distribute your mobile deals through multiple channels. For example, Clover’s free app, Promos, enables merchants to send offers to customers a number of ways—through email, SMS, and Facebook—from one place. Expanding your channels increases the likelihood that your customers will see and be reminded of the deal, creating more opportunities to get them through your door.
Customers use their phones while shopping.

69% of customers surveyed prefer to store and redeem coupons on their phone.
Over 75% of consumers surveyed use mobile while in store to look for coupons and discounts.

Mobile coupons are easy to redeem. All that’s required is to show the QR code for scanning at checkout. It’s a frictionless transaction, but there are still ways the transaction can go wrong. Have you ever been excited about a coupon only to lose out on the deal because of a technicality? Don’t let that happen to your customers. They may not forgive you. There are plenty of ways to be creative with digital coupons. (More on that later.) Don’t get fancy with the terms. Stick to tried and true offers like “Buy One Get One,” a free sample, or a percentage off (simple amounts so it’s easy to do the math). Real Offers is an easy way to offer simple discounts and promotions or any creative offer you decide to any of your existing customers.
Move past loyalty to relevance.

71% of consumers surveyed admitted that loyalty incentive programs don’t make them loyal at all.
58% of consumers surveyed visit a store, restaurant or business after receiving an offer on their mobile phone.

In fact, it’s actually an immediate need that is more likely to motivate a purchase. Build a deeper, more personal relationship with your customers by using mobile promotions to cater to their most relevant needs at that moment. MixaWallet Personalized Offers lets you create digital promotions targeted to specific customers based upon how they shop. Your mobile offers are sent to customers via email, text messages and/or the MixaWallet mobile app. Demonstrating that you understand your customers will earn you true loyalty and increase visits in the long run.
Show your personality!
Even though we suggest keeping the coupon deals simple, your whole coupon program needs to be boring. Take the opportunity to reinforce the personality of your brand through the creative execution of your campaign. Is your business based on being the “caring friend?” Time your coupons so they arrive when your customers need special reminders. Is your brand voice more of an “irreverent dude?” Use the text in the coupon to make your customers laugh.
If you need inspiration, you can find it each month on the Clover Promo Calendar. Based on our best practices what type of mobile coupons would you create to celebrate unexpected holidays like National Matchmaker Day or National Coffee Day?
Launch your first digital coupon campaign.
As with anything associated with your business, it’s important to be mindful of how you plan and execute your campaign. Here are six simple steps to get you started:

Begin with a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely) goal. Perhaps you need to sell perishable items before they go stale.
Find the best coupon apps in the Clover App Market. Choose what’s right for you.
Think about your most valued customers and what motivates them to act.
Create a simple offer targeting your best clients and write copy to build rapport with them.
When you launch your campaign, be sure to give your customers enough time to redeem the coupon. For example, if you want to move product during a specific time of day, then run that special for a full week. It’ll give your customers enough time to adjust their schedule to take advantage of the offer.
Compare sales before the promotion with sales during the promotion to see if there is a noticeable difference.

news_396,news,Merchant talkback: What’s the best wifi policy for your coffee shop?,"To WIFI, or not to WIFI? Internet policies vary from coffee shop to coffee shop, and if you are tired of hearing the question “what’s your WIFI password?”, you're not alone. We asked Clover coffee shop owners about their WIFI policy: here’s what they said.  …",22-08-2018,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/merchant-talkback-whats-the-best-wifi-policy-for-your-coffee-shop/,"“What’s the WIFI password?” is possibly the number one question coffee shop owners have to answer every day. As the freelance and remote work community continues to grow, coffee shops have become the de facto office for professionals, students, and everyone in between.
Many coffee shops find establishing an internet use policy is a bit tricky. Is free WIFI a boon or a curse? While offering an internet connection may increase foot traffic, what happens if your foot traffic never leaves?
Your internet access impacts customer satisfaction, revenue, and customer loyalty. With a little research, we found that every coffee shop treats internet access differently. An informal poll of Clover merchants found that the majority of coffee shop owners believe in offering free WIFI with a password.
Let’s start with the basic premise: does your coffee shop need to offer WIFI at all? Clover asked our merchants, and the results were mixed. It seems that a cafe’s internet-use policy is contingent on a number of factors.
According to one merchant, free WIFI can help fill a coffee shop during the daily service lulls. “Laptop customers can make the coffee shop seem busy and full during normally slow times. It’s depressing to go into a shop that’s dead.”
Another coffee shop owner in Evanston, IL agreed: size matters. “I have a larger coffee shop so I think having people here, if only on their laptops, makes the place look and feel busy so people think it must be good. For me, it enhances our business.”
Other coffee shop owners are wary of offering free WIFI, arguing that in some ways this dilutes their brand (and no one wants weak coffee!). “Often, people who are [at a coffee shop] to use laptops take over four seats or sofas. This is a business, not a free service…[Laptop customers] only buy one thing because they don’t want to leave their tech unattended.”
It can be frustrating (and bad for your bottom line) if WIFI vultures take up your seating without making an extra purchase or two throughout the day. But, some coffee shop owners have found it doesn’t always matter if you offer WIFI: some customers are smart enough to get it anyway, either through a hotspot on their phones or neighboring business. Said one business owner, “Coffee shops are a proxy for the urban environment of the future. The NOMA district of D.C. just spent $300,000 putting in free WIFI. It’s part of the deal when you assume the role of ‘coffee shop’ for now.”
If you do decide to offer WIFI, how should a customer be able to access internet service? There are a few different options ranging from completely open (no password necessary) to limiting user access to a specific amount of time before cutting off or charging.
Clover’s merchants seem to gravitate toward the latter, with the majority of those polled restricting access in their shop by either requiring a periodic access code made available with purchase or by charging. Some merchants have begun to ask for customers to trade personal data for WIFI: by asking for an email address or a like on Facebook, coffee shops can extend their marketing outreach in powerful ways.
If you are interested in revisiting your WIFI policy, start by checking out some of these smart tips from the Clover blog and talking to your customers. Coffee shops are all about community, so it’s smart to align your policies with the opinion of those who make that community possible.

news_399,news,Business problem turnaround: Recovering from a security or data breach,"Most small business owners don’t believe they’re at risk of experiencing a cyberattack. But they’re wrong. Half of all small businesses in the U.S. have suffered a data breach in the past year. What can you do to protect yourself and your customers?
…",06-09-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-problem-turnaround-recovering-security-data-breach/,"When hackers target a major corporation with millions of customers, it makes headlines. However, small businesses may actually face a much bigger threat from cybercriminals.
Most small business owners—87%, according to a recent survey by Manta—don’t believe they’re at risk of experiencing a cyberattack. But they’re wrong. According to one survey, half of all small businesses in the U.S. have suffered a data breach in the past year. And the consequences of an attack can be catastrophic for a small business. Experts estimate that as many as half of all small businesses that suffer a breach go out of business in the next six months. To put these risks in perspective, flip a coin—your chance of getting heads is the same as your chance of suffering a cyberattack. Flip that coin again, and you’ve got your odds of going out of business as a result of such an attack.
Unfortunately, your small business may be an even more attractive target for hackers than a major corporation, because smaller businesses are less likely to have state-of-the-art security for their networks or up-to-the-minute security training for their employees. But now that you know the risks, what can you do to protect yourself and your customers?

The first and most obvious place to start upgrading your cybersecurity is with your equipment. As of October 2015, merchants are required to be able to process EMV chip-based cards. If you still don’t have the necessary equipment, you’re liable for any fraudulent transactions made with chip-enabled cards. So if you still haven’t upgraded your POS system, this is a great place to start. All Clover POS systems, for example, are chip-compliant.
While you’re upgrading your technology, make sure that the providers you’re working with provide state-of-the-art security features to help guard your customers’ data. Understanding cybersecurity can get very technical, but there are a couple of key terms to look out for. End-to-end encryption is a system that masks all data from the moment it’s captured to the moment it reaches the payment processor, protecting customers’ credit card numbers, for example, from attacks during the time they’re being transmitted from your store to the bank that’s processing your payments. Tokenization is another key term to know—this means that instead of storing credit card numbers in your system, you’re storing randomly generated numbers that stand in for sensitive data, meaning there’s less risk for you in the event of a breach. Look for payment processing systems, like Clover’s, that provide these kinds of advanced protections.
The other key cybersecurity risk is human error. When you combine the many types of simple security mistakes individuals can make, like clicking on malicious links in phishing emails, or using unsecured mobile devices, a whole lot of data breaches can be traced back to human error. Make sure you and your employees understand cybersecurity best practices, and keep your training up to date as your systems change. Educating your staff will go a long way towards protecting your business.
How to recover if the worst does happen
First of all, don’t panic. It’s best to come up with a plan for how you would respond to a breach ahead of time, just like you would prepare for a fire or other emergency. That way, if you do get attacked, you have a plan in place and you aren’t trying to respond on the fly. Talk to the security experts who have helped you set up protections for your system to come up with a plan now—Clover’s customer support team is always available, for example.
Communicate with customers quickly and clearly. Don’t underplay the risk or exaggerate the skill of the hackers. Be honest and let customers know what they need to do to protect themselves in the wake of an attack. Make sure all your employees understand what happened and know what to say to customers who have questions.
If you can, offer some kind of compensation. Free products may be the easiest for you to organize, but helping customers with identity and credit monitoring will be even more appreciated, if you can manage it. If you can’t afford to connect customers to these services yourself, look for free resources you can direct them to. That way, when customers have questions about how to protect their data going forward, you have answers.
Surveys show that many customers do stick with businesses after a breach, but most do so because it’s too much hassle to switch. As a small retail operation, it’s a lot easier for your customers to simply buy their sandwiches or T-shirts somewhere else than it is for them to change banks or stop shopping at a major big-box retailer. That means you have to work even harder to make your customers feel supported and valued after a breach. Offer sincere apologies to everyone affected, do whatever you can to help customers feel secure, and focus on delivering top-notch customer service going forward. A data breach can be devastating, but it doesn’t have to be the end of your business.

news_400,news,Connect with customers,"Far from being expendable or replaceable, customers are a scarce and valuable commodity, the soil in which your business grows. Peruse 6 ways to connect with customers and, in turn, maximize profitability, and manage your cash flow.…",11-09-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/connect-with-customers/,"Odds are, if you’re reading this article, you have a business that has customers. Connecting with those customers is key to creating stand-out customer experiences, maximizing profitability and managing your cash flow. The first step to connecting with your customers and creating outstanding customer experiences is understanding what your customers are worth to you.
1. Do the math
Far from being expendable or replaceable, customers are a scarce and valuable commodity—the soil in which your business grows. And before you can effectively build out your customer base, you absolutely need to know these 3 numbers:

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV). Simply, LTV is the value a customer brings to your business, the amount of money a customer spends with your business in their lifetime. The LTV can help you understand exactly what a customer is worth to you. And this worksheet can help you calculate the average LTV.
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). Your CAC tells you what it costs to acquire a new customer. The CAC is key to understanding how much to invest in acquiring new customers. See #4 in this post to see how it’s calculated.
Conversion Rate (CR). Your CR tells you how many prospects convert to customers. Your CR can help you gauge the success and effectiveness of your marketing. Read #6 in this post to for the calculation.

With these 3 numbers in-hand, we can move on to ways you can connect with existing customers and begin to attract new ones.
2. Know your customers
To really connect with your customers, you have to know who they are and what makes them tick. Get to know your customers better with these tactics.

Dialogues. Dialogues aren’t just about greeting customers and knowing their names; dialogues are about creating a comfortable way for customers to share ideas and feedback. Since customers can be hesitant to honestly tell you what’s working and what’s not, tools like feedback apps and surveys can be exceptionally useful in providing a safe place for customers to share feedback—the good, the bad, and even the ugly. To help manage feedback and surveys, Clover offers several survey apps in the App Market, like Customer Survey and Customer Connect. Be sure to tap your best customers for their feedback, too.
Segments. Knowing your customers also means figuring out who your customer segments are and why. Customer or market segments typically share attributes, likes or dislikes, that differentiate that group from others. For example, because they’ve shared generational experiences, Boomer customers may respond differently to products or marketing messages than Millennials. A good place to start digging for customer insights is Google Analytics or the data you may be collecting from your website. When segmenting your customers, be sure to take time to understand who your best customers are and observe the attributes they share.
Personas. Understanding your segments can also help you identify customer personas, fictional characters that you create to represent your key customer segments. Based on common characteristics, attitudes and behaviors, personas make your customer segments tangible—they put a name and face on that group. And they can be a useful reminder of customer needs, wants and buying habits when you’re designing new products, programs to attract key customer types and marketing campaigns.


3. Engage and reward customers
After you have a handle on your customers—their likes and their dislikes—it’s time to engage them in a relationship with your business and reward them for their loyalty.

Service. Providing stellar service is a front-line way to build relationships. Take shopping lines, for example. They can mean different things to different people. To a business owner, they mean business is booming. To a customer, they could represent a must-have product worth waiting for, or they could represent a total time killer. Using tactics like line-busting shows customers you respect their time, value their business, and want to create a great, win-win experience. And great experiences can mean more customers and more cash flow.
Loyalty Programs. Have you ever gotten a birthday card or email from a business? Sure, it’s nice. You were remembered. But what if that card contained something more—maybe a coupon for a discount, a free download, or a free drink. Something that acknowledges you’re a customer and you’re appreciated. Something that creates an opportunity for engagement and transaction. That’s what a great loyalty program does. It not only recognizes a customer’s loyalty, it creates an opportunity to engage. Before you set out to design your loyalty program, check out these 6 questions to ask when crafting a winning customer loyalty program.
Rewards. Similar to loyalty programs, reward programs are slightly different in that they incentivize customers to engage and transact with your business. It’s true that setting up and tracking rewards programs can seem daunting. So Clover offers apps like Customer Connect Rewards and Rewards to make managing rewards programs a snap. And be sure to check out page 12 of this ebook for more ideas on rewards program. Finally, remember your personas can be instrumental in designing awesome perks for your customers.

4. Deepen relationships
Relationship deepening isn’t hard sales. Rather, it’s about understanding your customers—their needs as well as their likes—and presenting them with products or services that are relevant to them. Simply, it’s engaging customers with more of your products and services, more frequently. After all, the more products and services your customers use, the more likely they are to keep using your products and services. The key? Cross-selling and upselling. Here are a few ideas.

Captivate your customers. Retailers often see a spike in holiday or seasonal customers. The retail opportunity is to transform occasional, holiday or seasonal shoppers into frequent customers—to increase the frequency of their visits and transactions. Check out this post for helpful tips on turning occasional shoppers into loyal regulars.
Tailor your business. Your customers may love your product, but if your product isn’t available to them in a way they can access it, they’ll likely find another product that is. Consider tailoring your business to the way customers want to shop. That may mean adding a shopping cart to your website, presenting product info on your social channels or changing the hours of your urban shop to accommodate the business crowd.
Train your team. Your employees are the face, voice, and hands of your business to your customers. So training your team to create effective customer interactions is essential to upselling and cross-selling your products and services to customers.
Create events. One of the best ways to introduce new products or expose your customers to products they simply may not be using yet is to create an event they can participate in. Maybe you host a class that showcases new kitchen tools your shop carries, a webinar that highlights important info from the books you’ve started selling, or a presentation by a new personal trainer in your gym. The possibilities are wide open. Remember to think about your customer segments, your personas, and what would be relevant and interesting to them.


5. Turn disappointments into delight
One of the greatest opportunities businesses have is to turn bad or disappointing customer experiences around and blow customer expectations out of the water. It starts with preparation.

Coach your service team. Generally, customers engage customer service when there’s a question or a problem. Sometimes customers know what kind of resolution they want and sometimes they don’t. So coach your team to listen patiently and respond positively to customers. Your service team is your front-line, and they’re the ones that create the impression your customers will have of your business.
Listen to online reviews. Recent research suggests over 90 percent of customers read online reviews before making a purchase decision and almost 80 percent trust reviews as much as a personal recommendation. Fortunately, Yelp for Business Owners in the Clover App Market puts the power of Yelp at your fingertips and gives you the ability to respond to customer messages and reviews with a private message or public comment right from your Clover dashboard.
Stay on top of customer complaints. Part of dealing with the public is dealing with complaints. And they can arrive through every channel—an angry email, a persnickety post, even a livid letter. Some complaints are legit—mistakes and accidents happen—but others? Maybe not. The trick is knowing which is which, and avoiding the temptation to dismiss complaints that don’t seem to be legit. Remember that each customer has a network, and each customer encounter is an opportunity to blow past expectations. Check out this post for ideas that can help you manage serious customer complaints.

6. Attract new customers through existing customers
Finding new customers can be a challenge. Most marketers know that one of the most effective ways to attract new customers is to harness the power of customer testimonials and referrals.
Customer testimonials are powerful. A recent survey revealed that 97% of consumers went online last year for information about local businesses. And 85% put as much trust in online reviews as personal recommendations. Crafting a standout online reputation through customer testimonials is a journey made one step at a time. And these three steps can start you on your way:

Listen. Start by learning what’s being said about your business to get a realistic picture of your online reputation. Fortunately, a simple search and a scan of your social profiles can offer a good feel for what’s being said about your business online.
Engage. You can learn from your fans and your critics alike. Apps like Feedback in the Clover App Market help you engage in and stay on top of customers conversations.
Incorporate. After you have a good picture of what your fans and critics are saying, infuse positive customer testimonials into your marketing. That gives your customers a voice to share their positive experiences and lets you market your business through a source customers trust—other customers. Check out #3 in this post before you start for important info about collecting and using customer testimonials.

Referral marketing is a great way to attract new customers and retain your existing customers. Consider, for example, a program that offers your customers cash back for every item their friends purchase from your business. That program, if managed well, is likely to help you retain your customers and make engaged customers of their friends. And Clover apps like Customer Referral Rewards make it easier than you think to set up and manage a referral program.

Whatever tactics you choose to connect with customers, build deeper relationships and drive better customer experiences, one thing’s certain: results can vary. Sometimes, one tactic may be wildly successful, and another time, it could fizzle. As you build out your plan to connect with existing customers and attract new ones, keep these tips in mind.

Welcome new customers. When you get new customers, welcome them with open arms. Introduce a new customer welcome kit. Make customers feel special and glad they chose to do business with you.
Expect failure. We learn most when we fail, so expect some failures along the way. Maybe it’s a campaign that doesn’t resonate. Maybe it’s a customer group that you just can’t reach. Failure means you’re learning and growing. Most marketers know the real trick to failing is to fail fast, get up, and move forward.

news_402,news,Hiring & managing employees,"Employees can be fickle and frustrating, but they’re also critical players in every small-business success story. Use this 9-step hiring and managing guide to be the boss who people love, and build the workplace they’ll commit to.…",13-09-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/hiring-managing-employees/,"Building a business from scratch requires a capable team at every step, from serving the first customers to securing an enduring presence in the community.
But unlike products, revenue, or marketing, people can be ever-changing and complex. Tracking and adjusting their performances takes solid people skills. That’s why small business owners need a crash course in management.
With a little knowledge and the right tools, anyone can learn to spot promising candidates, encourage standout performances, and keep great employees committed to the business. Here are 9 steps for cultivating people and drawing out their best efforts.
1. Put together an attractive package
In a tight labor market, small businesses need to get creative to land employees.
The first step is to make sure the pay scale is competitive for your state, city, or vertical. What are similar businesses paying? Can you push the hourly rates beyond theirs? Higher pay has been linked to both higher productivity and better customer service. Check out some of the compelling research here.
What about other compensation-related tactics? Paid time off, commissions, bonuses, and profit sharing can be great incentives for attracting and motivating employees.
Another way to stand out is to offer a 401(k) retirement savings plan. According to a roundup of compensation trends, only 38% of small businesses help their staff save for the future. By investing in people for the long run, they’re more likely to commit to the business in return.
But money isn’t the only way to make people happy. Low-cost perks such as coffee, snacks, discounts, and free tickets are easy ways to build good will.
Another no-cost winner among job seekers and employees is thoughtful scheduling. More than anything else, employees want to know they can count on a regular schedule, swap shifts if needed, and get time-off requests honored. They appreciate employers who help them juggle their complicated lives.
For employers, erratic scheduling can quickly lead to departures, as people land more manageable jobs. Look into team management software that can both reduce scheduling headaches and solve employee complaints.
2. Create a workplace people want to join
Giving people predictable hours and sharing schedules far in advance are components of a much larger goal—building a company culture that employees will love. It’s an ongoing process with no one answer for how to get there.
As the celebrated entrepreneur Richard Branson noted, “There’s no magic formula for great company culture. The key is just to treat your staff how you’d like to be treated.”
Great bosses, for example, value and praise their people. They ask for and listen to ideas from staff. They’re respectful of others and enjoy time together, whether it’s a casual meal or an informative meeting.
Small business owners should regularly assess their strengths and weaknesses, and continually strive to be the best boss they can be. The payback will be stronger applicants and more committed employees.

3. Cast out your net
For many small businesses, the single most effective recruitment tool is word of mouth. When people enjoy working at a business, they tell their friends about it. Referrals require little effort and offer an element of prescreening. Merchants might even offer a referral bonus once a new employee reaches a specified anniversary.
But often the search needs to go further. If online postings are used, consider what top candidates look for in job descriptions. In a nutshell, be sure to clearly state minimum requirements, note the hourly rate, and play up any perks, such as free meals, flexible schedules, or training opportunities.
There’s no need to sweat all the details. To make the mechanics of hiring a little easier, outsource the task to apps. Homebase, for example, offers free HR resources, including pre-written job descriptions, new hire forms, hiring guides, performance reviews, and more.
4. Spot valuable players
Sometimes perfect candidates appear with the experience, skills, and personality to jump into a job. But for many small businesses without the resources to lure star employees away from competitors, the applicant pool can feel lackluster, filled with students and other new workers.
Here’s where a shift in thinking can help. Inexperience can actually be an advantage, especially if effective hiring practices are used to turn outsiders into insiders. Rather than bringing bad habits from previous jobs into the establishment, newcomers can be taught the essentials from the ground up and molded into valuable workers.
Another hidden advantage is that lack of experience lets business owners look past skills and focus on what really matters: attitude. Employees are the face of the business, so they’ve got to stay engaged and positive in every situation. Use the interview process to find out how candidates face tricky situations.
Are they empathetic to different perspectives? Do they have the patience to deal with frustrating people? What about their problem-solving skills? Here are five questions to ask before hiring for customer-facing positions.
But hiring isn’t always for entry-level jobs. One of the most important roles a growing business needs is an effective middle manager. Read on for tips about how to land a manager who will improve operations, jumpstart growth, and simplify life—so the boss can go on a needed vacation.
5. Train your people well
The quicker people learn their jobs, the better the business will run. Yet restaurant and retail employees seem to constantly come and go, leaving business owners scrambling to get people up to speed.
Don’t skimp on training. Give new hires the knowledge they need to jump into their jobs successfully, and enlist the assistance of experienced employees. When possible, try to hire two or more employees at the same to double the impact of training time.
Merchants might even streamline and automate the training process. Using checklists and original or free tutorials, employees learn the basics of safety, customer service, the brand, or other general topics. Check out these 9 strategies to reduce the cost of employee onboarding.
With an annual turnover rate among hourly employees hovering at 50%, consider ways to keep the team happy, engaged—and intact. Research shows that playing to employees’ strengths, communicating regularly, and investing time in employee development helps slow the revolving door.
Training never really ends, of course. Over time, merchants should teach employees every aspect of the business and fine-tune their skills. For example, fresh checkout scripts and improvisation exercises help cashiers upsell, cross-sell, and personalize the customer experience—skills that turn training into a profit-boosting operation.

6. Communicate effectively and often
It’s easy to get sucked into the frantic pace of daily life, with everyone focused on completing tasks. But healthy businesses marked by high levels of trust prioritize communication.
Business owners clearly articulate their goals. Employees feel free to share ideas and take charge of solving problems. Meetings and get-togethers are regularly convened—even if it’s just a huddle before the doors open.
Brief, focused staff meetings, in fact, can build camaraderie and boost employee knowledge. Open up team meetings by honestly reporting on the state of the business, both good and bad news. People appreciate having hard facts, as well as opportunities to contribute ideas.
Meetings are also a great place to tap the expertise of top performers and leverage it to drive sales. Get people to share their tips and skills, whether in the kitchen or on the floor.
For many businesses, superior sales techniques distinguish the most effective employees. Ask employees to role-play being customers, and let the sales wizards show how it’s done. Simulating real-life scenarios makes sales pitches, product knowledge, and even insights into the customer more immediate and actionable.
Merchants can also use meetings to assign and report on projects, whether it’s rethinking the reservation system or revamping deliveries. Read about these and other ideas for running staff meetings that trigger concrete improvements.
Communication can happen anywhere. It can take the form of casual conversations or even in the way processes are set up. In restaurants, for example, communication breakdowns between the kitchen and the customer-facing staff can wreak havoc on the ordering process. Improving communication between front- and back-of-house also improves the customer experience.
7. Help people step up
One of the most effective ways to engage employees is to empower them. That means teaching them the business, listening to their ideas, and giving them opportunities to grow.
Even part-time and seasonal workers crave learning new things and taking on more responsibility. A Colorado adventure company, for example, draws its young staff back summer after summer by helping them move into management positions, funding EMT training, and offering other avenues to progress in their careers.
Given that part-time workers dominate small businesses, it pays to cultivate them and help them feel like they’re significant contributors. Ask for their opinions and observations, and find out if they have hidden talents they’d like to try out in the business. You never know where your next social media guru or sales display artist will come from.
Empowering people can slow employee turnover and slash the cost of replacing people—$18,000 annually for a restaurant with 30 employees. By giving trained employees the autonomy and responsibility they crave, employees will be motivated to go above and beyond for customers.

8. Face problems before they fester
Nobody likes to deal with employee problems. But when someone is underperforming, it’s time to act. Not only do they reflect badly on the business, but weak coworkers can also drag down morale.
First step is to make sure people understand how to do their jobs. Have they been properly trained? Do they know what’s expected? Are unexcused absences the result of last-minute rescheduling on your part?
If you can help the employee, do so. If problems persist, HR professionals recommend progressive discipline. The process might start with a verbal warning, proceed to a written warning, then a suspension, and finally termination, each thoroughly documented in writing to avoid legal exposure. Apps such as HR Resources provide performance review tools and corrective action records to safeguard the process.
For more serious problems such as stealing or drinking on the job, the employee must be let go quickly and definitively. Follow up with the team to explain what’s happened.
While removing a poor performer can often energize the team, sometimes the entire staff feels dissatisfied and disengaged. Gossiping, excessive tardiness, burnout, lack of effort, a spike in turnover—all of these symptoms point to problems that need to be addressed.
Positive tactics such as recognizing people, giving them predictable schedules, offering opportunities to grow, and encouraging communication can help reverse negative behaviors and reignite employees.

9. Celebrate together
The writer Maya Angelou once said, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”
That powerful observation can be applied to business. At the end of the day, we remember our jobs and coworkers by how they made us feel.
Cultivating a positive, supportive workplace might be the most important thing business owners can do. An easy way to do that is to recognize birthdays, milestones, and individual accomplishments. Foster a culture where employees recognize each other’s great work.
Consider group activities such as volunteering, a meal out, or an informal party held after closing. And don’t forget to get away from it all from time to time. Shared experiences, such as picnics, outings, and even affordable overnight retreats can be bonding experiences for the entire crew.
Sure, people can be fickle and frustrating, but they’re also critical players in every small-business success story. Be the boss who people love and build the workplace they will commit to.

Now, less than two years after shipping its 500,000th device, Clover has already doubled down on that milestone by shipping its one millionth point-of-sale system into market. Momme Imbusch, the owner of Friesen-Apotheken pharmacy in Germany, purchased the millionth Clover device this September.
Friesen-Apotheken offers its customers prescription medications and over-the-counter medicine, as well as cosmetics and other beauty products. While Momme has been in the pharmacy business for only about five years, he is carrying on the family legacy: his father launched Friesen-Apotheken in 1979, and Momme intends to eventually initiate his three-year-old son into the family’s pharmacy operation as well.
Momme, who has a business background, said his neighborhood pharmacy brings him and his staff face-to-face with nearby residents from all walks of life—and in particular with elder neighborhood residents. Their customers love Friesen-Apotheken because of the pharmacy’s knowledgeable employees, its speedy delivery service and its recent adoption of Clover, whose sleek look fits right in at their newly renovated space.
“Our customers are truly impressed with the appearance of the technology and how fast and easy it is to use,” said Momme. “They just touch their card to the Clover and they are done.”
Momme said the pharmacy’s investment in Clover was an investment in the future. Their previous POS did not have the features Friesen-Apotheken needed to move forward with his vision for the business.
The millionth Clover purchase comes during a year when Clover has passed other major milestones that enable the company to help more businesses run their operations better, including an expansion to Austria and Germany and the launch of the second-generation Clover Station.
To commemorate the occasion, Clover is taking a look back at the founding, launch and evolution of the company, starting with the Silicon Valley visionaries who incorporated Clover in 2010, and proceeding through a litany of device launches, partnerships, large-scale integrations and a burgeoning international expansion. With every step, large and small, Clover has been intent on increasing the effectiveness of its technology for small business, and on making it available to ever more business owners and their consumers. Scroll through the infographic to see a selection of those milestones.
Clover is pausing to take in this landmark occasion—but only for a moment. As the sale of the millionth Clover recedes into the rear view, Clover is focusing on the road ahead, including continuing to evolve its technology for current customers and those yet to come.
With Clover in their corner, Momme and team are looking ahead as well.
“As a healthcare business, finding the right technology is the best medicine for our company. Clover allows us to spend more time keeping customers healthy and keeping our family business running efficiently,” he said. The pharmacy appreciates how Clover’s speed, contactless payment capability and ease of use positions Friesen-Apotheken to continue delivering value for their customers.

As with anything, you’ve got to get the basics down first. Good inventory management starts with understanding what you have and getting a handle on your logistics. This can be time-consuming, but it doesn’t have to be—a modern POS system with integrated inventory management tools can save you a lot of time.

Keep your storeroom organized, and do everything you can to make regular inventory counts as simple as possible.
Keep your inventory as lean as you can.
Keep your overhead low by negotiating with vendors.
Understand the most common ways businesses price their products, and choose the one that works for you.
Know how and why shrinkage occurs, and how to prevent it.
Confront the problem of employee theft head-on.


Beyond Logistics
It’s one thing to know what’s on the shelf, but it’s another thing to know how best to push it out the door. Once you’ve got your inventory management system as close to air-tight as possible, it’s time to get strategic. This means displaying your products attractively, knowing when to offer discounts, and keeping some tricks up your sleeve for that item that just won’t sell.

Learn how to create a display that moves product.
Learn some tricks for selling perishable products faster—or upcycling them if all else fails.
Figure out what to do with that product that just won’t move.
Use discounts and clearance sales strategically.
Know what to do when you sell out of something.
Teach your employees how to move more product by upselling.

Big Data for Your Small Business
A modern inventory management system that integrates with your POS system is an invaluable tool for any small business. Today’s technology allows you to see what’s selling, not just at the end of the quarter, but from minute to minute. Use that data to make smarter business decisions.

Get detailed performance reports on all your products.
Know when it’s time to discontinue a product.
Make sure you have the right overall product mix.
Use real-time data to respond to changing conditions quickly.
Data can also help you design better promotions.


Planning for Smart Growth
All that data your smart inventory management system is tracking can also help you grow your business more intelligently. After all, if you know exactly what’s working today, you can create more detailed projections of what might work tomorrow.

Go beyond understanding what’s selling now and develop a product strategy for the future.
When you launch a new product, do it with an eye on the data.
Know when it’s the right time to add a second (or third, or fourth) location.
Think like a startup—experiment, fail fast, and learn what works.

…",25-09-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/the-concise-guide-to-increasing-productivity/,"How often do you look up at the end of the day and wonder where time went? For small business owners, the day can disappear without ever reaching the end of your to-do list. Achieving peak productivity can feel like trying to scale a never-ending mountain of tasks.
Being “busy” is a trap that many merchants fall into without realizing it. Many business owners spend their time in the trenches of running a business: managing employees, ordering inventory, keeping up with accounting, or simply trying to get a handle on marketing. Busy-ness does not equal productivity, however. The majority of small business owners report wishing they could spend more time on big picture work. Instead of working harder, the secret is learning how to work smarter—and more efficiently.
Productivity apps and productivity software are just two pieces of the great puzzle on how to squeeze more out of your workday. Read on for our productivity tips for small business owners.
Time Management
Time is of the essence. Take back your time by understanding where you might be losing minutes (or hours) to repetitive tasks or other time thieves (think: payroll, restocking inventory, employee scheduling). Nearly 70% of small business owners would like to spend more time working on the higher-level priorities, rather than getting in the weeds of their operation.

news_408,news,Analyzing your business’ numbers,Monitoring the financial performance is more than reading and maintaining your financial statements. You also need to know how to interpret the numbers so they tell a full story. Here’s how financial ratios can help you do that.…,26-09-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/analyzing-your-business-numbers/,"Monitoring the financial performance of your business is key to understanding its overall health and uncovering trends. It’s not enough to read and maintain your financial statements. You also need to know how to interpret the numbers so they tell a full story. Financial ratios can help you do just that.
Financial ratios are calculations that reveal the relationships between different values of your company’s financial statements. They simplify unwieldy numbers and enable you to compare them to industry or regional averages to see where you stand. They generally fall into four categories: liquidity, solvency, profitability, and operating efficiency.
Liquidity
Liquidity ratios measure the amount of cash (and assets that can be easily converted into cash) to meet short term financial commitments. A fundamental ratio is the current ratio:
Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
Examples of current assets are cash, short-term investments, pre-paid expenses, accounts receivables, and inventory. Current liabilities can be credit card debt, accounts payable, bank operating credit, accrued expenses and tax payable. The rule of thumb is to have more assets than liabilities with a ratio of about 2:1.
If this isn’t the case, then there are actions you can take to improve this number. Increase your assets by staying on top of invoices. Use this worksheet to identify ways your business might be “bleeding cash.” Decreasing overhead is also an option. Get creative and decrease your monthly rent through colocation.

Solvency
Solvency ratios shed light on your ability to meet debt obligations on an ongoing basis, while sustaining operations indefinitely. You can calculate this by using the debt to equity ratio:
Debt to Equity = Long Term Debt ÷ Equity
This means that your company is financed by shareholders rather than creditors. The lower the number the better. Check out this article’s section on equity financing for a simple overview of the concept. If you decide to improve this number by increasing equity, here are five questions to ask a potential investor in your business. You can also try building equity through crowdfunding, which allows you to raise money from a community of potential investors via an online forum.
Profitability
It goes without saying that profitability is the most important indicator of success. Only you will have a sense of a healthy profit margin for your business. Net Profit Margin is the best indicator of financial health and long-term viability.
Net Profit Margin = Net Income or Profits ÷ Total Revenue
You can improve profitability by increasing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and getting creative with your customer engagement program. Consider crafting a winning customer loyalty program or finding ways to encourage recurring purchases.
Also dig deeper and evaluate the pricing of your products. Have you accurately accounted for the cost of your expenses in each category? If your analysis leads to the decision of raising your prices, be sure to devise a plan to keep your customers happy despite the price increase.

Efficiency
Operating ratio evaluates the efficiency of your company’s core business activities by comparing operating expenses to net sales:
Operating Ratio = Operating Expense ÷ Net Sales
Your operating expense is the total of all expenses, not including taxes and interest payments. Monitor it over time and notice when it increases. That’s a sign of inefficiency. Operating expenses are increasing or net sales are decreasing. If you see this happening look for ways to streamline your business processes or make better use of your assets.
Clover is built with hardware and software that will help you run your business more efficiently. Now is the time to break down each moment in the day, vigorously identify inefficient practices and find ways to end them. For example, restaurants can find ways to streamline order deliveries or use a Clover handheld device to take payments at the table.
Other Insights To Consider
While financial ratios are a common way to monitor your business they are not the only way. It’s up to you to identify the right combination of numbers that will provide you with the right information that will support sound decisions. If you’re still feeling intimidated by the idea of crunching numbers, then try Clover Insights to benchmark your performance against similar businesses.

This guide will help you tackle some of the most common—and difficult—problems that all small businesses face.
Start with the basics
Nobody starts their own business because they dream of doing more paperwork or yearn to make their taxes more complicated. But administrative work is part of the job. Check out some tips for making tax time easier, streamlining your busywork, and plugging up the leaks that can drain your business of much-needed cash.

Location, location, location
Choosing the right location for your business is one of the most important decisions you have to make. A great location, with lots of foot traffic, provides an automatic boost to your bottom line. An-out-of-the-way spot can make it seem impossible to get ahead. But with some savvy planning, almost any location can be made to work to your advantage.

Deal with the downsides to the spot you’ve got, including a lack of parking, construction, and excess noise: Overcoming location woes (without moving)
Learn from a case study of a business that found they weren’t quite close enough to a stadium to benefit from the foot traffic: How one bar turned a location challenge into a new revenue driver
Figure out how to bring your second location up to your first location’s standards: Second location isn’t replicating the original’s success
Think outside the box: Could colocation be a worthwhile tactic for your business?

Increase foot traffic
You can’t change a business district that’s dead at night into a neighborhood with a raging nightlife, but you can take some steps to increase foot traffic to your location. Don’t just accept that your coffee shop is always going to be dead all afternoon. Look for some ways to create a lunch rush, or keep patrons staying, and spending, longer.

Push your product
Moving inventory is crucial for any business, but every business eventually runs into those products that just won’t sell. Whether it’s a donut, a dog collar, or a dress, there’s a way to market it that will push it out your doors.

Turn leftovers into new meals, sell seasonal products online, and other great tips: Creative ways to move product faster

Improve customer relations

But how can food sellers create experiences that bring customers back? Explore these 4 ways your restaurant can connect with customers to create come-again experiences.
…",04-10-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/the-restaurants-guide-to-forging-a-meaningful-customer-experience/,"For most of us, restaurants, cafes, and pubs are places we go to celebrate, share, and enjoy good food and drink. But how can restaurants connect with customers and keep them coming back again and again? With a little creativity, careful tool selection, and some inspiration from these 4 suggestions, come-again connections are within every restaurant’s reach.
1. Do a little homework
Connecting with your customers is grounded in understanding what customers really mean to you and your restaurant. Seems straightforward, right? After all, customers bring in the money that boosts your cash flow. But understanding the lifetime value of your customers and how it’s calculated helps you grasp just how much money a customer could spend with your business over a lifetime. And that understanding can move your restaurant’s entire marketing focus from constantly scouting for new customers to nurturing those you already have.
In fact, most restaurant owners understand the need to put effort into pulling new customers through the door, but they may not know that the cost of getting a new customer is typically higher than the cost of keeping an existing customer. Shifting your marketing focus from just scouting for new customers to keeping those you already have means shifting more attention to your customer’s experience.

2. Create an unforgettable guest experience
Creating a standout experience isn’t just about the food, beer, or coffee you serve, it’s also about what you do for your customers. According to this recent Deloitte study, patrons connect with restaurants who serve up these actions.
Engage. First impressions count. Simple things like greeting each guest who enters your establishment and letting them know you’re glad they came starts to forge a connection. And not doing so can produce instant fallout, as this restaurant discovered. Keep the hostess area organized. Provide accurate wait estimates, and offer more options with apps like WaitlistMe for letting parties know their tables are ready. If wait times are longer on certain evenings, make sure guests have a pleasant place to wait. Consider offering complimentary waters or a sample tasting to whet their palettes.
Empower. Experiences with your brand start well before a guest sets foot in your restaurant. They can start with your digital presence, like your website, mobile app, or social profiles. Create anticipation before guests venture in by telling the story of your restaurant, your chef, or your space. Give guests the power of choice by providing online reservations through Open Table, or offer average wait-time information for the busiest nights of the week. And when customers do arrive, make selection and ordering simple through clearly-written menus and well-trained, knowledgeable staff. When it’s time to leave, offer quick, easy options for payments and splitting tabs. And don’t forget takeout customers. Make online ordering simple and convenient with apps like iMenu 360 Online Ordering or Kwik Menu.
Listen. Hearing customers as they make requests, express needs, or demonstrate challenges, and thinking out of the box to meet those needs goes a long way in creating experiences that bring customers back. For example, one of the big challenges of dining out for families is keeping small children occupied. So offer activities that keep little hands busy as they wait for a table or for food. And making ingredient and allergen information—particularly regarding gluten, nuts, and dairy—available to guests with special dietary needs goes a long way to building trust and appreciation.
3. Keep customers coming back often
How do restaurants keep and deepen relationships with customers? They show customers that they appreciate. Peruse these simple ways to deepen valuable relationships.
Appreciate loyalty and reward repeaters. A stellar loyalty program for restaurants not only acknowledges customers and shows them they’re appreciated, it creates an opportunity for engagement and transaction. Studies show loyalty programs increase purchases by as much as 20%. As you design your customer loyalty program, be sure to ask these 6 questions. And check out 4 tips specifically for café loyalty programs. Incentivizing customers to dine more frequently, order that extra dessert, or chase dinner with a coffee is easy with apps like Customer Connect Rewards and Rewards. Finally, consider launching a VIP program for your best customers—you can even design affordable perks for them. For more reward program ideas, take a peek at page 12 of this ebook.
Create occasions and host events. Whether it’s customizing tables for large parties, welcoming after-work business socials, or accommodating book club meetings, being the place where customers create occasions can bring your guests coming back with their colleagues, friends, and family. Consider creating your own events to engage customers. For example, offer a cooking class for singles or a lesson in pour over coffee brewing methods at your venue. Or offer an invitation-only event for your VIP customers to sample your unique flavors. Invite customers to participate in a theme night: think 80s sci-fi night, Halloween fright night, or weekly sports night. And never underestimate the value of hosting a charitable event to show support of your community and present your brand to the local market.
Throw in some freebies. Giveaways, raffles, and contests can get customers’ attention and don’t have to be expensive. Buy a couple of tickets to the theater, the symphony, or a sporting event as draw prize. Or gift a dinner for two to the customer who refers the most friends in a month. And check out these 8 smart, affordable ways to deepen customer relationships.

4. Pull new customers through the door
In our recent interview with David Joseph, restaurateur and current tech company cofounder, he shared: “A restaurateur once said to me, ‘The most expensive seat in a restaurant is the empty one, because it’s costing you’.” So how do you fill empty seats? Before foodies can enjoy your delicious edibles, they’ve got to know you’re there. Filling those seats can be as simple as this rule of thumb: be social, reach new customers through existing ones, and test.
Be social. One of the least expensive ways to get the word out is by marketing your restaurant through social. The goal is to increase followers and to turn those followers into customers. But to attract followers you need content. Content can include posts about events you’re hosting, recipes from the chef, photos of the kitchen staff in action, or anything that might interest your patrons. Another way to create content for your restaurant is to have your fans create it for you. For example, ask customers to take a pic of their favorite dish from your place, post it, and share it on a page you set up for them. Turn it into a fun event by awarding the pic with most shares or likes with a gift card. For more ideas about marketing through social, check out 5 marketing tools that boost your restaurant’s visibility and section 2 of this ebook.
Reach new customers. Use reviews, testimonials, and referrals of existing customers. Each month, 100M+ visitors turn to Yelp for information, ratings, and reviews on all kinds of businesses, including restaurants. But in the frenetic everyday of food service, many restaurants struggle to find time to manage online reviews—reviews that can make or break their reputation in the local community. Fortunately, Yelp for Business Owners makes it easy to connect with customers, respond to reviews with a private message or public comment, and manage your Yelp page to help garner great Yelp reviews. And when you receive outstanding reviews from customers, harness those testimonials for your marketing materials. Lastly, remember to encourage customer referrals, but keep in mind these dos and don’ts of referral marketing.
Test new-to-you tactics. One of the best tools of marketing is testing. So be open to testing new-to-you tactics, whether coupons, email marketing, or fun apps, like Food and Drink Exchange. Conjuring Wall-Street-style excitement through dynamic pricing, this app lets customers watch item prices change in real-time as products are purchased at your venue. When guests order in-demand items, prices of those items rise and prices of competing items fall—just like the stock exchange. Dynamic pricing can spin up a festive atmosphere fast and increase profits.

But for a restaurant, where nearly everything you buy and sell comes with an expiration date, it’s absolutely crucial. If your idea of inventory management is eyeballing your walk-in before you close up for the night, read on. These tricks and tips will help you bring your restaurant’s inventory management system into the 21st century.
Inventory 101
The restaurant business comes with plenty of unique challenges, but good inventory management starts with the basics: keeping things organized, training your employees well, pricing products effectively, and choosing the best possible vendors.

Keep your storage spaces impeccably organized so you can find things faster.
Move beyond the clipboard with modern inventory management apps.
Minimize costly mistakes by streamlining communication between front-of-house and back-of-house.
Price your menu to boost sales—and your bottom line.
Build good relationships with local farmers.


Keep costs down
Some things are out of your control as a restaurant owner. A freak snowstorm or E coli outbreak can throw even the best plans out the window. So control what you can—starting with how much you pay for your supplies.

Know how to negotiate a better deal from your suppliers.
Consider a purchasing collective if you only need a small amount of some products.
Written recipes and careful portion control can help keep costs under control.
Let front-of-house staff know when to push specific items.

Reduce food waste and spoilage
The amount of food wasted in the United States is staggering—an estimated 30 to 40% of the total food supply. That’s a massive sustainability crisis, a wasted opportunity to feed the hungry, and a huge waste of money if you’re the one buying all that food. Cutting food waste is a great opportunity to make your business stronger and more sustainable at the same time.

Make sure you move perishable product quickly.
Store products properly to slow spoilage.
Get creative and create a new dish from yesterday’s leftovers.
You’ve heard of farm-to-table; why not try root-to-stalk?
Design your menu with an eye to waste reduction.
Align your business with a great cause and donate leftover food.


Have a plan for slow nights (and weeks)
Whether it’s every Monday or every August, most restaurants deal with slow nights. They can be murder on your bottom line and can disrupt even the best inventory management plans. Strategize to find the best ways to fill those seats and move that product.

Reach out to locals on nights when the weather is bad or tourist traffic is slower.
Optimize your menu for slower foot traffic by purchasing fewer highly perishable items.

This month we’re featuring a suite of apps from Yellow Dog Software to keep your stock numbers in check.
Yellow Dog Inventory
Inventory can be difficult to manage, especially if you run multiple locations or store excess stock in warehouses. Yellow Dog Inventory simplifies your tracking process and links all the data directly to your Clover devices with just a few taps.
This streamlined system allows you to manage item lists, bar codes, count sheets, purchase orders (even with required approvals), invoices, receipts, transfers, and more. You can run reports on your inventory based on multiple criteria, and important existing data with breeze. No matter what you need to do to stay on top of your inventory, Yellow Dog can help. And as a special bonus, This app comes with free training to help you make the most out of what you have in stock.
Yellow Dog Count Retail
Sometimes it’s important to double check your inventory, or do a specific count to make sure the reality matches the spreadsheets. Yellow Dog Count Retail allows you to scan bar codes and make sure that your numbers match the system. This software allows you to create unlimited count sessions, and to customize them to fit your precise needs. If you don’t have bar codes, you can also manually enter items and track them through this system. You need to have Yellow Dog Inventory to make this work, but for any retail establishment, this will make counts a breeze.
Yellow Dog Count F&B
Yellow Dog knows that inventory management can be very different for the food and beverage industry as compared to retail, and their specific Count F&B app address those issues directly. Just like the Count app for retail, this one allows you to do quick counting by scan bar codes or manually entering quantities. But if you have uploaded your recipes into Inventory, it will track based on amounts used and units sold. It’s a great solution to keep track of items that may be used in multiple recipes so you can order appropriate amounts of stock at the best times.
Be sure to check out these and other small business solutions available to you in the Clover App Market.

news_419,news,Analyze the profitability of your restaurant with business metrics & numbers,Take the guesswork out of what’s working for your restaurant and what’s not. These key metrics for FSRs will help you fix inefficiencies and identify trends that will impact your bottom line.…,23-10-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/analyze-the-profitability-of-your-restaurant-with-business-metrics-numbers/,"“The economics of setting up a new restaurant are scary in good times and terrifying in bad ones.” John Lanchester
Managing daily financials is one of the toughest responsibilities of owning a full service restaurant (FSR). Inventory, staff, and overhead must all be closely monitored while keeping the unique details of each in mind. Many business owners use financial ratios to understand the relationships between the different numbers of their company’s financial statements.
While standard ratios are a good start, they simply aren’t enough to help restaurant owners understand the overall health of their FSR and identify trends. Here are a few restaurant metrics to keep in mind the next time you review your financials.
Prime Costs to Total Food and Beverage Revenue
Prime Costs = Hourly Labor + COGS
Prime costs are costs that can be directly attributed to the creation of a product. For restaurants that would mean inventory, beverages, management, hourly wages and benefits. The FSR industry standard for prime costs is 65% or less of your total food and beverage revenue.
If your calculations show a percentage above the average, this could mean your minimum sale price is too low. Try reevaluating the pricing of your menu. But be careful how you increase prices so your customers remain happy.
Carefully tracking and managing inventory will also help you stay at or under the target benchmark for FSRs. For example, Recipe Keeper will automatically adjust ingredients in your inventory based on the number of dishes your customers order. Bottle Keeper will do the same for your bar by tracking the ingredients of cocktails.

Food or Beverage Costs to Sales
Food Cost = Cost of Ingredients ÷ Price of the Meal
Beverage Cost = Cost of Beverage ÷ Price of Beverage
The industry standard for the ratio spent on food ingredients is 30%, but could go as high as 40% for finer FSRs. Beverages could range from 15% for non-alcoholic drinks to 40% for wine. It’s important to take the time to regularly calculate actual food costs and compare them with your ideal costs. Staying on top of these numbers allows you to quickly spot changes and devise a plan of action.
If you find a discrepancy that makes you uncomfortable, dig deeper and see if your employees have increased portions or are comping their friends. If the ingredients of your most popular dishes have become more expensive, it may be time to negotiate a better deal with your suppliers.
Overhead Rate
Overhead Rate = Total Monthly Overhead ÷ Total Monthly Sales
Prime costs cover the costs it takes to prepare and serve the meal. Overhead costs have to do with the money you spend while actually running the business. Operational expenses like rent, taxes, utilities, salaries, equipment, repairs and maintenance, as well as advertising and marketing all fall under this category.
Efficient restaurants usually run between a 30% and 35% overhead rate. If your rate is higher, that doesn’t mean you’re stuck with these fixed costs. For example, why not decrease the expense of rent by offering space for a pop-up shop? Explore reducing your advertising costs by moving away from purchasing ads and focusing on developing deeper relationships with your existing customers.

Table Turn
The amount of time from when a diner is first seated to when she leaves is known as “table turn.” The key is to lower this number while protecting the dining experience. The best way to do this is by making sure service—from taking the order to paying the check—runs as efficiently as possible.
Clover Dining offers FSRs all the features they need to ensure a smooth experience for their patrons. Combined with Clover Flex, it allows servers to create and manage orders throughout the meal. When it’s time to settle up, it can even split checks and take payments at the table.
Average Cover
Average Cover = Total Sales During a Shift ÷ Number of Covers
Identify your strongest servers by calculating the size of the average check during their shift. Clover Dining makes it easy by reporting sales by employee. Increase the overall average cover of your staff by setting up an effective performance management process. You can also make increasing the average check fun for your employees through gamification.

If you’re hoping to beat those odds, you’re going to need some solutions to common problems restaurants face. Keep reading for advice on how to turn your problems around.
Money and security

…",06-11-2018,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/this-clover-cafe-built-a-killer-customer-loyalty-program-you-can-too/,"Building up a business from scratch is no cake-walk, as Patrick Yeh can attest to. Having grown up in Taiwan, he wanted to reconnect with his culture and bring some of his family heritage to his new hometown—New York. What better way than through serving tea—a traditional way to bond with family and friends.
At first, developing his products and launching the business was exhausting, with a lot of late nights as he perfected recipes. Now, Bar Pa Tea attracts avid fans with long lines in the Nolita neighborhood of New York—phenomenal growth Patrick attributes in part to his customer loyalty program.
Loyalty programs are inexpensive to put together and can make a huge difference in your business’s growth. Just take a look at what Bar Pa Tea was able to achieve with Clover’s free apps Rewards and Promos.
“With Clover Rewards I see a lot more customer loyalty,” says Patrick. “It gives me a lot more options to do the promotions like a welcome bonus, V.I.P bonus, and also birthday bonuses.”
Why Build a Loyalty Rewards Program?
Research shows that the probability of selling to a new customer is 20%, but selling to an existing customer has a probability of 70%. If that isn’t enough to get you thinking about a loyalty program, consider that the same study shows that it costs up to 5 times as much to attract a new customer than it takes to keep an existing one.
What can a loyalty program can do for your business? It can:

Boost your revenue: tempting your fans back in for more sales.
Attract more attention: aficionados raving about your business helps attract new customers through word-of-mouth marketing.
Save money: by marketing to customers already in your database.
Stabilize cashflow: maintain a steady flow of income as “regulars” keep coming back.
Fine-tune your promotions: you’ll learn more about your best customers so you can target “look-alike” customers with similar demographics.

Visits or $$$? Deciding How to Structure Your Loyalty Rewards Program
Reward programs are not just to engage loyal customers and entice them to spend more money with you. They also need to make sense for your business. Consider what your primary goals are. Will you use rewards to spark interest in new products or to keep your bread and butter items flowing off the shelves? Do you want to encourage spending specific amounts or are you trying to increase foot traffic during slower periods? How you structure your loyalty program depends on what you’re trying to achieve. Check out these articles to make sure your loyalty program is growing your business:

3 Things to Consider When Structuring Your Loyalty Program.
Choosing the Right Loyalty Program for Your Business

Make Your Loyalty Program Simple, but Irresistible
What gets folks to sign up for a rewards program? According to research,

73% of consumers said rewards must be relevant.
68% said rewards must be easy to redeem.

news_422,news,8 awesome Clover apps every coffee shop needs,"Indie coffee shops can hold their own against the corporate giants with a few simple hacks. Try out these 8 apps that work with your Clover POS to boost productivity, marketing reach, and the customer experience.…",07-11-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/8-awesome-clover-apps-every-coffee-shop-needs/,"Starbucks may be the 800-pound gorilla, but independent coffee shops continue to hold their own. One reason is the sheer number of customers. A full 75% of the US population is devoted to coffee, with 37 percent of young adults consuming gourmet blends on a regular basis.
Here are easy-to-use apps to help tap this market and compete against the corporate giants. Each app works seamlessly with the Clover system to boost productivity, marketing reach, and the customer experience.
1. Run a tight ship.
There’s no room for waste in coffee shops. Keep on top of what comes in or out with Shopventory. The app tracks inventory across locations, sends alerts when items run low, and identifies slow-moving products to push or discontinue. Maintaining control over the operation directly affects the bottom line.
2. Build schedules in minutes.
Like keeping track of products, managing paperwork can be time-consuming. Homebase’s Schedule and Time Clock (we’re counting this suite as one app) makes administrative tasks a breeze. The apps let you build schedules in under three minutes, automatically handle time-off requests, clock people in and out, export timesheets for payroll, and more.
3. Make payroll stress-free.
Mess up payroll and you can be hit with unexpected taxes and legal penalties. With Gusto, payroll is quick and accurate. Use the app to do automatic payroll filings, W-2s, 1099s, unlimited payrolls, and direct deposit. Why keep dreading a task that you can put on autopilot?
4. Update signage in a few strokes.
Does your menu change a lot? Go the fast, high-tech route to update signage. All it takes is a digital display and the Menu Boards app. Simply make changes to pricing, descriptions, or featured products in the Clover POS and hit “push.” No hand-lettering or printing jobs required.
5. Use personal deals to increase traffic.
Clover Rewards lets you move beyond stamp cards and “buy ten, get one free” offers. With digital programs, you can create multiple perks to reach more customers, and set up bonuses for regulars and VIPs. Offers go straight to the customers’ smartphones—quick incentives to come back for more.
6. Connect with coupons.
Paper can still make an impact. Consider rolling out offers on customers’ printed receipts using Promos. The app also lets you send mobile coupons to phones, email addresses, and Facebook. The more channels you use to reach people, the more likely they’ll return for their deals.
7. Spread the word using gift cards.
Did you know that customers using gift cards make more unplanned purchases and buy more expensive items? Use Gift Cards to create your own plastic or digital card, add money to cards, redeem them, and track usage on-screen. You can even sell the cards to customers so they can give them to others as gifts.
8. Help customers skip the line.
Some people just want to pop in for takeout. Capture a customer’s regular order with ShopScanGo and output a label to scan. Using the app, the customer can instantly send in reorders to your Clover POS and automatically pay—no waiting for orders to be filled and processed.
Another time-saving option is Clover Flex, a micro version of the POS that fits in employees’ hands as they work the line taking orders.
The Clover POS comes with a growing fleet of apps that save time, extend reach, and help you compete. Check out the Clover App Market for more ideas to improve your business.

news_423,news,20 business resources every veteran entrepreneur should know about,https://twitter.com/cloverpos…,12-11-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/20-business-resources-every-veteran-entrepreneur-should-know-about/,"According to national survey data collected by the US Small Business Administration, there are about 2.5 million businesses owned by military veterans in the US. Veteran-owned businesses employ more than 5 million people; they are an integral part of the American workforce and the lifeforce of many communities across the country.
Many veteran business owners have taken advantage of the resources exclusively available to military service members to help their ventures find success. From business education programs to loans and financing, these are the business resources every veteran entrepreneur should know about.

Veteran Business Loans and Banking
It’s no secret that veterans often have the leadership and other qualities necessary to find success as a business owner. Veteran-owned ventures are arguably more successful than the average start-up.
However, every entrepreneur needs mentorship, funding, and support to get take their idea from concept to market. Check out these loan, grant, and banking resources exclusively available to small business merchants who have served (or in some cases, are actively serving) in the military.

Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan: from the Small Business Administration, this loan helps small businesses meet operating expenses if an “essential employee” is called to active duty. The interest rate on these loans is 4%, with a loan amount limit of $2 million and max loan term of 30 years.
Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business Program: another SBA program, apply for government contracts of up to $5 million if you own at least 51% of the business and have a service-connected disability.
StreetShares Small Business Award: in partnership with JP Morgan Chase, online lender StreetShare is hosting a business competition to give away a total of $10,000 in three monthly awards to veterans, reserve or active-duty members who qualify, as well as military-spouse small merchants.
SBA 7A Express Loan Program: this is a replacement of the popular Patriot Express Loan Program from the SBA, which granted up to $500,000 in as little as 36 hours. Now, the replacement 7A program gives veterans access to as much as $350,000 if approved.
Hivers and Strivers: this angel investment fund provides support to start-ups founded and run by graduates of the U.S. Military Academies.
UPS Franchise Opportunities: not ready to make the leap into being a full entrepreneur? Consider becoming a UPS franchise owner. This company offers discounted franchise fees to veterans. Cut your teeth on running a business with the support of a big corporation backing you up.
Learn about applying for government grants with this comprehensive guide on Business Grants for Veterans.


Organizations for Veteran Women
There are many consulting opportunities available to women who are former military service members, as well as some organizations geared towards specifically helping veteran women. If you’re a woman-owned, veteran-owned business, you may be interested in some of these resources.

Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship (V-WISE): this organization provides business education to women veterans and female military spouses or partners to turn an idea into a successful business venture.
Resources for Women Veteran-Owned Businesses: check out this list of resources from Self Made to learn more about what women veterans can access.
Women’s Business Centers: this network of more than 100 educational centers run by the SBA assists women who seek to start and grow their own business.
Check out this index from the American Women Veterans Organization for everything from childcare to employment opportunities and education and training.

Business Mentoring, Guidance, and Advice
If you have a goal in mind and just need some guidance on how to achieve your next milestone, some of these training programs and mentorship opportunities much be just the thing you’re seeking. Check out the American Corporate Partners program for advice from Fortune 500 companies, or Patriot Boot Camp for developing your own tech startup.

Veteran Business Outreach Centers: run by the Small Business Administration, these centers are geared toward providing assistance to transitioning service members, veterans and military spouses looking to start, purchase, or grow a business.
Veteran Fast Launch Initiative: this initiative, run by the nonprofit association SCORE, offers free software, mentoring, and other support to military veteran entrepreneurs.
Boots to Business: another SBA initiative, Boots to Business (B2B) is a two-part entrepreneurial training course with classroom elements and online modules to teach participants elements of early business ownership and forming a business plan.
American Corporate Partners: we like this organization, which pairs companies like Allstate, GM, Coca-Cola, and IBM with US veterans for mentorship and career advice.
Patriot Boot Camp: this program is an accelerator focused on assisting military veterans and their spouses to build technology companies.
EBV Foundation: this foundation partners with the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans training program to help graduates develop business plans, find a mentor, and grow their business. They also host a business plan competition that may be right for your business idea.
VetToCEO: this free online course prepares former military members to prepare for the challenges of owning and running a business.

news_425,news,Hire heroes: Why (& how) your small business should hire more military talent,"Small businesses benefit from hiring military talent in many ways. Veterans’ leadership skills, dedication, quick thinking, and teamwork are all major assets that come into play when they join your workforce. Bottom line: hiring military veterans is good for your bottom line. …",15-11-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/hire-heroes-why-how-your-small-business-should-hire-more-military-talent/,"If you were to describe your perfect employee, words that are likely to come up are leadership, responsibility, and hard work. There’s another group of individuals who are frequently described in these terms: military veterans.
Many veterans own their own small businesses, but the fact is that unemployment for veterans remains around 3.4%. One of the hardest parts of reintegrating into civilian life is often finding employment; small business owners can do their part to help heroes find their way by hiring more military talent. There are so very many reasons to hire veterans. Here are just a few.
Leadership
It should come as no surprise that military veterans are usually extremely talented leaders. This is because the average age of a Marine recruit is 19; by age 20, most Marines are typically promoted to become a non-commissioned officer. Across the military, young people are frequently placed in high-stress leadership roles. By the time they return to civilian life, veterans are often able to assume leadership roles with ease. If you’re seeking to hire a manager for your small business, consider hiring a veteran; they often make great candidates.
Dedication and Reliability
Percy Jenkins, a veteran-turned-small business owner, knows that most veterans have the right temperament to make amazing employees. “One thing I love about veterans is that they are calm and disciplined; most of us don’t overreact. We don’t react emotionally,” Jenkins says. Employers who hire veterans consistently report that veterans show up on time (or early), are reliable, and perform with integrity.
Excellent Teamwork
Military service members are taught a mission-first mentality. They will work together to do whatever it takes to accomplish the task you’ve set before them. As one veteran describes, few other institutions ingrain the mindset of “mission achievement, cooperation and personal development” quite like the military. If you’re looking for someone who can step into an open role, take the responsibility seriously, and work well with others to help your business find success, look no further than a military veteran.
Ability to Learn Quickly
Veterans already have a plethora of skills that translate from their military career to a business context. Adaptability, calm under stress, organization and perseverance are some of the areas former military members are well trained in. Studies also show that veterans are able to pick up new skills quickly. The learning curve for managing a small business is a lot less steep for veterans than say, new graduates. The majority of companies in one study reported that hiring veterans has been “good for their bottom line,” pointing to leadership and dedication as two of the traits that help veterans learn quickly. Not unlike startups and entrepreneurs, veterans can recognize the need to fail fast, learn, and keep growing.
Tax Benefits
Of course, you should hire a veteran for their outstanding work ethic and personal skills. But, as an added perk, there are some tax benefits your small business might take advantage of for hiring a former military service member. The Returning Heroes Tax Credit allows for $2,400 – $5,600 to be applied for every unemployed veteran you hire. There’s also the Wounded Warriors Tax Credit which doubles the existing Work Opportunity Tax Credit for long-term unemployed veterans with service-connected disabilities for to up to $9,600. Some other benefits that your business may be eligible to receive:

Veterans with Services-Connected Disabilities: this applies to veterans with service-connected disabilities who are hired within one year of being discharged. The credit is 40% of the first $12,000 of wages (up to $4,800).
Long-Term Unemployed Veterans with Services-Connected Disabilities: this credit provides 40% of the first $24,000 of wages (up to $9,600) for firms that hire veterans with service-connected disabilities and who have been in receipt of unemployment compensation for longer than 6 months.
Nonprofit tax-exempt organizations may be able to take advantage of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit by hiring eligible veterans and receiving a credit against the employer’s share of Social Security taxes.

news_426,news,Business scenario: Negotiating your first store lease,"Whether you’re opening a business for the first time, expanding out of your home office, or bringing your online business to the real world, signing a commercial lease can be daunting. Check out this post to find and negotiate the best commercial lease with confidence!…",15-11-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-negotiating-your-first-store-lease/,"This post is part of our Business scenario series. Read the entire series here on the Clover blog, and check back for more tips and tactics.
So, you want to open a storefront. Congratulations! Whether you’re opening a business for the first time, expanding out of your home office, or bringing your online business to the real world, signing a commercial lease can be daunting. Real estate is a big business expense, so how can you find and negotiate the best commercial lease with confidence?
We’re here to help. But first, before even considering a lease, it’s mission critical to choose the the right location for your business. Check out this post for top tips on finding the perfect area for your commercial lease.
Next, it’s time to negotiate the commercial lease terms. Like any business deal, it helps to get some basic terms and background under your belt so you know what to expect before heading into a lease negotiation. Here’s what you need to know.
1. Know the basic terms and structures of commercial leases.
There are many different types of commercial leases, and knowing what you’re being offered is half the battle. Here are a few of the biggest business lease terms you need to know.

Single Net Lease or Net Lease: where the tenant pays utility and property tax, while the landlord pays for maintenance, repairs, plus insurance.
Net-net Lease or Double Net Lease: where the tenant is responsible for utilities, property taxes, and insurance premiums, while the landlord pays for maintenance and repairs.
Triple Net Lease: where the tenant is responsible for all the costs of the building, and the landlord only pays for structural repairs.
Full Service Gross or Modified Gross Lease: where the tenant and landlord split most of the costs of owning and operating the building (the “base rent”). This is common for multi-tenant buildings.

Wondering what type of lease is the best lease? There’s no right answer! Each business is different, and your needs will change whether you’re a restaurant, salon, or retailer. The key thing to understand within each of these lease structures is precisely what, besides rent, you are responsible for paying each month.
2. Understand your needs.
As a business owner, you probably have a pretty good vision for how your business will grow in this new space. It’s crucial, however, to make sure that your vision is specific. Have a solid business strategy and plan for growth so you know how much space you need, how much you can afford, and for how long you intend to lease the space. Many commercial leases are multi-year agreements. If you’re hesitant to sign up for that long, consider doing a pop-up shop to test the location.
Determining the size of the space you need will also help you get a sense of your budget. Many commercial lease options are priced per square foot. To know how many square feet you need, you’ll need to determine the number of customers or the size of your workforce to be sure the layout is just right. As a benchmark, “restaurants and retail locations typically require 15 square feet per customer on average.” An office may require more: roughly 100 – 150 square feet per employee.
3. Make sure to get the initial offer in writing.
An easy, common mistake many first-time business owners make is to present a counteroffer before seeing the lease terms in writing. Never start a negotiation without knowing precisely what cards are on the table. If a leasing agent verbally tells you the terms, ask for something in writing so you can review every subclause, any hidden costs, and the standard leasing information. Without something in writing, you could be at risk to counter too high or too low (or be liable for agreeing to something you didn’t understand up front). It can also be helpful to have a lawyer look over the agreement before putting in your counteroffer.
4. Prepare a counter-offer.
This is the part that can feel scariest for most first-time renters. Real estate agents fully expect you to make a counter-offer to their initial proposal; this is part of the business negotiation. Experts suggest being bold during this phase. Always ask for more than you think you want. Want three months free rent? Ask for five! Areas where you might negotiate can include the initial deposit, the lease length, and free months if you sign a longer agreement. During your negotiation, it’s a good idea to get lease proposals from a number of properties and leasing agents so you can compare and contrast the different prices and options available. Let them compete for your business.
5. Build a safety net.
There are a couple things you can do to protect your business if you’re a little shaky on your ability to negotiate the best lease possible. First, make sure your lease includes an “out” clause, meaning you can get out of the agreement if the need arises. This can take the form of an “option to sublease” or a shorter lease length with an option to renew. You should also protect your business with insurance and by double checking zoning laws before moving into the business space. Some landlords include insurance in the agreement, but you need to be confident you know what that insurance covers. Check out this article for the lowdown on additional insurance coverage.
Negotiating a business lease can be intimidating, but it’s all part of the experience of being a business owner. Whether you’re a retailer or restaurateur, Clover is here to help you find success in your new location! We can’t wait for the grand opening.

…",28-11-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/2019-planning-4-key-numbers-to-watch-in-long-range-business-planning/,"Sometimes managing your business keeps you so busy it’s hard to tell how you’re really doing. Knowing a few quick tricks for measuring the health of your business can really help you stay on top of the bottom line. Here are 4 key financial numbers to help you stay on top of your long-range business planning.
1. Profit
Keeping track of your business financials is a lot like keeping your own budget, and your Profit and Loss sheet is an excellent tool to help you monitor your long-term financials. Monitoring the profit-and-loss statement helps you figure out longer term trends and helps you make small adjustments that can really boost your profits.
How to Calculate
Total Income – Total Expenses = Profit
What You Can Do With This Info

Beyond telling you whether you made or lost money, it can also give you a snapshot of where your money is going. You can scan through the expenses column to see if any expenses are higher than you expected, or if, over time, you are regularly spending more than you anticipated.
When reviewed monthly, year-over-year, you’ll be able to see trends and cycles that will help you predict business. For example, does your business typically grow right before Christmas? Is there a slump in the summer? Knowing that will help you plan out how much help you’ll need during seasonal periods.
Are you growing enough profit to save for big expenditures you’ll need later? For example, will you have enough to expand your storefront, buy a food truck, or replace a large refrigerator?

2. Income By Customer
One of the best tools for business owners who use Clover devices is a free app called Clover Insights. This handy app will help you track income by customers, or in other words, how much money each one of your customers spent with you this year.
How to Calculate
Simply take your sales and break it down by customer. If your customers use the same payment method or a loyalty card number, this is relatively easy. It’s even easier if you’re using the Clover Insights app.
What You Can Do With This Info

Once you’ve been open a few months, this data will be able to tell you who your most valuable customers are. Use this information to entice these high-spending customers back into your storefront.
Reward your most loyal customers to make them into evangelists. Not only will you get more revenue when they come back, they’ll start to talk about you to their friends.
Use Insights to learn more about these customers…what demographics do they share? Where else do they shop? Knowing this will help you learn what types of products interest them, which stores might be good to partner with, and where to advertise your business.

3. Revenue By Product
Which products are your money-makers? Careful…it might not be what you think. While you sell hundreds of banana-bread muffins, it might turn out that bananas have been super expensive lately and you’re actually losing money for every muffin you sell. And maybe you only make $0.50 for every fidget spinner you sell, but you’re making a ton off them because they are the hottest trend this year. It’s good to periodically check on this metric, because it can change over time and challenge some of your deepest assumptions about your business.
How to Calculate
You can calculate this two ways. Either break down your sales by product or look at your inventory numbers. Once you know how many of each product you’re selling per month, you’ll multiply those numbers by the profit you make for every sale. Clover Insights can also help you calculate this with ease.
Average number of products sold x profit per sale = revenue by product
What You Can Do With This Number

Decide to start selling products that complement your money-makers. (How about a coffee with that muffin?)
Try to upsell your biggest money makers with every sale.
Now that you know what’s really bringing in the cash, review your other products to get rid of any that just aren’t making you money. Or, if you think a low-profit product is a real draw and one of the reasons people come to your store, then look for ways to bundle it with others.

4. Time to Payment
Never lose sight of your cash flow. You want to make sure that money is coming in faster than you are spending it.
How to Calculate
Measure the number of days it takes from the time of purchase to the time the money hits your bank account.
What You Can Do With This Number

Time your inventory orders to make sure you have plenty of money in the bank to cover orders.
Consider offering promotions during months where you anticipate higher expenses.
Don’t like what you see? Change the terms of payment or encourage customers to pay in a preferred format.

news_429,news,Accelerating payments can mean accelerating sales. Here’s how.,"Think you can grow your business if you move your line faster? Learn more about how a mom & pop shop in New York City did just that. 
…",04-12-2018,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/accelerating-payment-means-accelerating-sales-heres-how/,"There’s no denying the fact that NYC is filled to the brim with big business. But mom & pop stores bring much needed character (not to mention brilliant products) to the marketplace, too. One such store is Olive’s, run by Clover merchant Nick Hartman. He opened up his first shop in 1992 to offer high quality, freshly prepared food to grab on the go. With locations in SoHo, Battery Park City, and beyond, Nick is always finding new ways to meet the needs of his clientele.
Navigating Rushes
It may seem like the busy has a constant flow of customers, but there are swells no matter the location. There’s a morning coffee and breakfast rush, a push a lunch, and often a third as people are either heading home, or back to the office to power through another pile of tasks. Rush hours mean long lines, which can really frustrate customers who are looking for a speedy payment process.
To raise his line busting game, Nick uses Clover Flex devices to supplement the minis he has at the countertop. “I have 30 people in my line. They’re getting here and instead of waiting to pay, I can have 4 methods of payment available immediately.” Using a mobile POS means literally meeting customers where they are, creating a heightened sense of customer care.
Not only can you bring Clover directly to the customer, it has the fastest transaction times in the business. Chip card readers, called EMV readers, are often sluggish and slow. Clover clocks it under three seconds for EMV transactions, making the increased security a breeze!

Big Business Security
One of the reasons it can be hard for small businesses to flourish is that they lack the support resources of larger entities. If you have Clover, however, you may have more support than you realize. Nick describes the confidence he has in his payments security:

Simply put, a break-even analysis shows you when your business will break even—when you will cover all the costs of being in business and making your product and start to turn a profit. …",05-12-2018,https://blog.clover.com/uncategorized/break-even-analysis-a-key-business-planning-tool-made-simple/,"A break-even analysis is an invaluable tool for any small business. Simply put, a break-even analysis shows you when your business will break even—when you will cover all the costs of being in business and making your product and start to turn a profit.
The Formula
The core of a break-even analysis is a simple equation:
Break-even point = Fixed costs ÷ (Unit price – variable costs per unit)
Let’s take a closer look at each of these terms.
Fixed costs
Your fixed costs are the costs of just keeping your doors open. Think about what your budget would look like if your business didn’t make or sell any products, but you still had a store and employees. You’d be paying only your fixed costs, which would include things like:

Rent
Utilities and phone bills
Equipment (bought or leased)
Insurance
Interest on debts
Salaries

Any bill you have to pay before you sell a single thing, and any bill you have to pay every month regardless of how many items you sell, is a fixed cost.

Variable costs
Variable costs are the costs of actually making your product. If you’re operating a restaurant, for example, this includes the cost of purchasing ingredients. If you’re making jewelry, the cost of your raw materials is a variable expense—something you only have to pay when you’re making your product. No matter what your business is, marketing and advertising is a variable cost because you pay it when you’ve actually got something to sell.
Staffing costs can actually be split between fixed and variable costs. If you operate a clothing store, for example, and you pay your employees a base rate plus commission, that base rate is a fixed cost and the commission is a variable cost.
Unit price
Here’s where the break-even analysis really gets interesting. You set your own prices, and your break-even analysis will look vastly different based on the prices you set. A higher price would help you break even faster—but only if you can actually sell enough product at that high price.
Setting the right price for your products involves some additional calculations, and some important judgment calls. Basically, you want to price your product high enough that you make at least a small profit on each unit sold, but not so high that customers are turned off and it’s hard to make sales.
Using the formula
Now that you know what your costs are and how much you will charge for your product or service, you can plug those numbers in to the break-even analysis formula and see what happens. Use this interactive break-even calculator to play with some numbers and see how it works.
Let’s say you make hand-knit sweaters that you sell for $100 each. If your fixed costs to start up shop are $10,000, and you pay $30 per sweater in materials and other variable costs, you will break even once you sell 143 sweaters. If you discount your sweaters to $75 to drum up more business, you’ll have to sell 223 sweaters to break even. If you use cheaper yarn and cut your variable cost per sweater to $20, you only have to sell 125 sweaters at $100 to break even.

When to use it
Obviously, a break-even analysis is incredibly useful when you’re thinking about starting a new business. Doing this analysis will show you how long it will take you to cover your startup costs. If you need to sell 143 sweaters, and you estimate you can sell 10 sweaters a month, it’ll take you more than a year to break even. If you’ve got the savings to make that work, great. If not, you’ll either need to cut your costs or sell sweaters faster.
You can use a break-even analysis in an established business, too. It’s a great exercise to do before launching a new product, for example. You can use the break-even formula to help you figure out the best price for your new product. You could also use this tool if you’re thinking of making a big investment in new equipment, additional staff, or a new marketing campaign. A break-even analysis could show you how long it will take to cover the costs of that investment.

news_431,news,5 ways gift cards can drive sales and win customers this holiday season,Here are five tactics you can use to make the most of gift cards for your business.…,05-12-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-ways-gift-cards-can-drive-sales-win-customers-holiday-season/,"The holidays are upon us again, and one of the most flexible tools small merchants can use to get more sales during this time of year are gift cards. There are more ways to use gift cards to support holiday revenue than might immediately come to mind. Here are five tactics you can use to make the most of this versatile tool.
1. Sell them as gifts.
This is perhaps the most obvious use case. Gift cards have been the most requested item by gift receivers for 10 years in a row. They provide the gift receiver with the flexibility to select an item they like.
As for givers, they can have it both ways: a branded gift card from your business is arguably more thoughtful than a generic, prepaid gift card from a credit card issuer.
2. Get cash up front and a post-holiday bump.
Seventy-five percent of consumers spend an average of $38 more than the value of their gift cards when they redeem them. This means you receive the upfront cash upon the gift card purchase, plus the potential for a little more revenue when the customer redeems their gift card for an item or service.
And if the recipient has never shopped with you before, gift cards can represent a chance to win a new repeat customer, which can mean even more revenue throughout the year.
3. Use them for rewards and store credit.
A rewards program is an effective way to increase customer loyalty. Consider using gift cards to reward customers for repeat visits, or for spending a certain dollar amount at your location. Remember the statistic about the majority of gift card recipients spending more than the value of their gift cards? Expect additional cash from your customers when they redeem the gift cards you give them as rewards as well.
On the flip side, a gift card can also be a great way to manage returns and store credit. If gift-givers didn’t purchase a gift card for their loved ones in the first place, you can create another opportunity to keep dollars circulating within your business by giving returning customers gift cards instead of cash for returned items.
This is also an effective tactic for handling returns throughout the rest of the year.
4. Make them the reward for customer list-building promotions.
If you’re looking to grow your social media followers and/or email list, offering a gift card to people who connect with you can make for a compelling prize. With a gift card, increase the likelihood that contest entrants can exchange that card for a product or service they’ll like.
5. Do local cause marketing: use gift cards as prizes for fundraisers.
Sponsoring a fundraising prize can be an effective way to give back to a community or cause you care about. It can also offer branding value for your business.
Consider offering a gift card as a fundraiser prize. You’ll get the brand recognition from being announced as fundraiser supporter, and you may earn additional goodwill through this accessible form of community-based “cause marketing”–a recent study cited in AdWeek concluded that seven in ten Americans like brands who engage in cause marketing (either in general, or if they agree with the cause).
As for the recipient, not only will receiving a gift card enable them to choose their own reward, it will also enable you to get them into your location, giving you a shot at converting the recipient into a repeat customer.

Ready to maximize your sales with gift cards? Get started here.

news_433,news,5 questions to ask: Is your promotion worth repeating?,Promotions are the old standby to bring in new business. But how do you make sure your promotions are worth the effort? Here are 5 questions to help you determine: Is your promotion worth repeating?…,06-12-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-is-your-promotion-worth-repeating/,"Promotions are often breadwinners that can be a lot of fun to plan and run. (Especially when the customers start rolling in.) But they are also very time-consuming, and it can be easy to lose sight of whether they are still adding value or just draining profits and energy. How do you make sure your promotions are worth the effort? Here are 5 questions to help you determine: Is your promotion worth repeating?
1. How much did it cost you?
Making a profit is not the only reason to run a promotion. They can be designed to meet all sorts of business goals such as adding new customers to your email list, advertising your latest specials or rewarding your loyal customers. But even if boosting profits was not the goal, when you’re trying to figure out whether to repeat a promotion you need to know how much it cost you. If you, at a bare minimum, broke even and the business results were worthwhile, it’s likely a winner. If you didn’t break even (or even come close), you may want to try something new.
To calculate costs, add up all the promotional costs including time to plan the promotion, train the staff, and to get the word out. This can be trickier than it first appears, especially if you weren’t tracking your time accurately. You should also calculate the breakeven point—the number of units you have to sell of that promotional item to make back your costs. To calculate, divide all those costs by the profit you make on each sale.
Armed with the total costs and an estimate of what you needed to sell to make it back, look at your actual results using Clover’s app, Insights. You can see how many units you sold in the promotional period.
You should also consider whether the promotion led to more sales. For example, you may not have sold enough units to break even, but if the promotion brought back your best customers and they spent more than you expected you may have still ended up ahead. A quick look at your average ticket size will give you a sense of whether folks stuck strictly to the promotion or also got tempted into buying a little something extra.
Wondering whether you enticed customers into the store who didn’t take advantage of your campaign? You can also compare the total sales to a similar time period when you weren’t running any promotions. This will reveal any “additional” sales you got by increasing foot traffic.

2. Did your promotion help you meet a business goal?
Now that you know what your costs and profits were, look at whether you had any additional upside. Did the promotion help your business get ahead in other ways? For example, were you able to grow your social media following? If so, you increased your ability to stay in front of your customers and advertise future promotions. Did the promotion offer the opportunity to reveal a new product and get first-hand feedback from your customers? This can be priceless and save you from investing too much in a product that your customers just aren’t interested in.
Did it fail to meet the goal you intended, but brought unexpected benefits that make it worth repeating? (Sometimes the unexpected results are the best ones!)
On the other hand, you may also find that a promotion solved a business problem and there simply isn’t a reason to run it again.

3. What would you lose if you didn’t repeat the promotion?
Are you going to be the only storefront not running a Christmas special? Is this promotion the only reason customers trek out to your ski shop in the middle of summer? Think through all the risks of not running it again.
Another way to look at this same question is, will customers be disappointed if you don’t run it? If you think there is likely to be disappointment, do you have a plan to handle that?
4. Were you able to keep up with demand?
Was your team overwhelmed by the response or confused by the promotional rules? This may seem minor at first until you look at it from the customer’s perspective. If I waited in a long line to speak with a harried cashier only to discover the promotion sold out early I might not be inclined to return. Here are a few questions to help you quantify your efforts:

Did you run out of stock?
Did transactions take much longer as staff struggled with coupon codes?
Were the lines longer than necessary?
Did you have enough staff to handle the rush?
Did you get good feedback from customers, or did you mostly get complaints?

Another key issue to think about is whether it will be easier to run the second time around, or will it require just as much work?
5. Are the customers who took advantage of the promotions “high-value” customers?
As a business owner you’re probably keenly aware that not all customers are the same. Some come in only for sales, while others become regulars or will buy even when you aren’t reducing the prices. In fact, some become true fans and help you promote your store. Take a look at the people who attended your last promotion? Does Clover Insights indicate they are your most valuable?
Promotions are a great way to bring in more customers, and with the tips above you’ll be able to optimize them and grow business quickly. Want more help running promotions? Check out Clover Promos and other apps on the Clover App Marketplace.

news_434,news,Getting paid on time: Financial planning advice for your small business,"Business is booming, but customers consistently pay late. Getting paid on time is a struggle for many small business owners. What could they do differently to get the cash they need? Learn about 5 problems that slow down payments and cash flow. 

…",07-12-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/getting-paid-on-time-financial-planning-advice-for-your-small-business/,"You’re doing everything right. Your products are wildly successful. Your services are getting rave reviews. But you can’t get your best customers to pay on time. What gives? Why are you not getting paid?
Business owners know that getting paid on time is critical to maintaining a healthy cash flow. In fact, one of the great struggles of small businesses is getting customers to pay on time.
The answer to slow payments and cash flow problems may lie in one or more of these 5 problems. It’s time to dust off the ol’ magnifying glass, grab a vintage pipe, slap on a Sherlock cap, and do some sleuthing.
Problem 1: Vague or No Payment Policy
Have you crafted a clear payment policy that works for you and your customers? Have you spelled out that policy clearly in your contracts? Setting good terms and conditions at the beginning of a transaction or project is critical to getting paid. Be clear about when customers should expect to make a payment or downpayment, what methods they can use to pay, and late payment penalties or early payment incentives. And be sure to put all this information in writing, so your customers have a realistic understanding of your policy and how it affects them.
Problem 2: Disorderly Invoicing
In the daily hubbub of running a small business, it’s easy to let invoicing slip. Your customers are good for the money, and a slight delay in payment won’t matter much, right? Wrong. If money’s not coming in on time, you could lose track of what’s owed to you. Worse, you may not be able to pay your bills when they’re due. That puts your cash flow and your business at risk. Check out this invoicing checklist to stay on-track.
Do you …

Have a schedule? Schedule time each week or month for invoicing, and stick to it.
Know who owes you what? Keep a running list, a tab, or a spreadsheet of what customers owe you. Fortunately, Clover’s got you covered with handy apps like Cash Log and Insights.
Have correct contact info? Be sure you have up-to-date customer contact information for your invoices. Wrong contact info can mean delayed payments. And delayed payments impact your cash inflow.
Know your customer’s payment cycle? If you own a business that services large organizations, it’s important to understand not only who’s responsible for paying your invoices, but the process and timeline they typically follow.
Provide clear explanations? Invoices should provide a clear explanation of services, charges, and other relevant details about the products or services your customers purchased—especially add-on fees. The more questions you answer up-front, the faster the payment process.
Explain your terms? Whether it’s a 3% or 10% penalty for late payments, noting penalties for late payments incentivizes customers to pay on time. And because it’s not unusual for customers to pay just outside the customary 30-day window, consider shorter-term payments like a 10- or 20-day payment window. Or, blow customers’ minds by offering incentives for making a partial or full payment before an invoice comes due.
Offer convenient payment options? Writing a check and putting it in the mail may work for some customers but not for others. The easier you make it for customers to pay you, the more likely it is you’ll get your money on time.
Brand your invoices? Clearly identify who’s sending the invoice. Consider invoices yet another opportunity to build your brand with customers.
Use digital tools? InvoiceASAP and InvoiceAble work with Clover devices, most mobile devices, and desktop computers to create invoices and accept credit card payments. To move customers toward digital payment options, consider offering a small incentive for going paperless.
Set automatic reminders? We all forget some things sometimes—especially bills. So setting reminders may be the ticket. Offering a tap on the shoulder may help chronic late-payers remember to make that payment sooner.


Problem 3: Limited Payments Options
For some businesses, like food vendors and coffee shops, cash is still a gold standard and a preferred method of payment for some customers. But have you ever stood in a long line at a shop only to realize the hold-up? It’s cash only. That’s fine if you’ve happened to stash cash in your pocket, but it’s also just enough of a delay for a vast number of card users to walk. Payment technologies are transforming shopping, eating at food trucks, and more, so consider adapting cashless payment options, even if you’re not in retail, to prevent payment slowdowns.

Credit Cards. When most business owners think of going cashless, they think of credit cards. If you haven’t yet set up credit card processing, be sure to check out 5 things you need to know about accepting payments and 5 things you should ask when selecting a credit card processor. When it comes to using credit, consumers value security. Unfortunately, cyber villains are always looking for easy prey, like small businesses. Fortunately, your business doesn’t have to be vulnerable. Simply look for a safe, secure, EMV-compliant payment system. And remember, if you can’t process chip cards, you’re liable for all disputed transactions.
Mobile Payments. Why should you consider adopting mobile payments? Because mobile usage is almost ubiquitous in the US and the number of consumers paying with a mobile device is on the rise. In fact, “Forty-six percent of U.S. consumers report having made a mobile payment, which translates to approximately 114 million adults,” according to this 2016 study. What’s more, enabling mobile payments can increase product sold per transaction. Check out what happened when these local Girl Scouts used mobile payments to sell cookies. And Clover offers several mobile readers to get your business mobile-payment ready fast, like Clover Flex or Clover Go.
Gift Cards. Gift cards are a cashless payment option that not only helps you manage payments, but also inspires customer engagement and loyalty. With holiday shopping season upon on us, gift cards are a great way to drive holiday sales and snag more holiday revenue. And with apps like Clover Gift Cards and Gyft, introducing a gift card program is a snap. See how gift cards boosted business for this merchant.

Problem 4: No Short-Term Credit or Back-Up Cash
What happens if your biggest customer pays late? Do you enough cash on-hand to pay your employees, utilities, or vendors? Do you have ready access to quick cash for your small business?
Small businesses often turn to local banks for an infusion of funds. But getting a traditional bank loan often means taking time to fill out an application, pulling at least two years of documentation together, and running a personal credit check. The net result for almost 80% of small businesses is a rejection.
That’s where alternate cash sources like crowdfunding, angel investors, and even invoice factoring companies, can help. For even faster funding, check out Clover Capital. It offers a simple 1-page application process with funds hitting your account in as little as 3-5 days after you’re approved. The best part? You repay the loan based on your sales.
Problem 5: No Ps and Qs
Cultures change, languages evolve, and manners morph. But customers still value appreciation. In hurried business schedules, it’s very easy for business owners to become so focused on what they’re doing that they overlook why and for whom they’re doing it—the customer.
Little acts of kindness, like a thank you on an invoice, a handwritten note, or a friendly call to follow-up on a late payment can translate into better customer relationships, and better relationships can translate into more business. If you invoice by email, keep in mind these email dos and don’ts. When it comes to getting paid, the little things matter.

news_435,news,Merchant talkback: Recovering from business mistakes,"Avoid some of the most common startup mistakes with advice from Clover merchants like you. We asked our customers to share the most common mistakes they see startups making. Here are the top 5 they mentioned along with ideas on how to recover—or dodge them altogether.
…",09-12-2018,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/merchant-talkback-recovering-from-business-mistakes/,"When starting a new business, it’s inevitable that there will be a few bumps in the road. Clover asked our merchants what were some of the biggest mistakes they see small businesses making and how they recommend fixing them. Here is what they said.
Mistake 1: Trying to do everything yourself
Many entrepreneurs struggle with letting others manage key business responsibilities. Founder and CEO of Transcription Outsourcing, Ben Walker writes about the need for outside opinions and skill sets, regardless of your vertical.
“We want to take control of as many aspects of the business as possible, which can make it hard for us to feel comfortable sharing responsibility,” Ben shares. Instead, he suggests focusing on diversifying perspectives within the business, trusting your team, keeping an eye on the big picture, and outsourcing as necessary to keep your workload manageable. After all, a burnt-out CEO can only move the business forward so much.
Mistake 2: Not choosing the right people
At the end of the day, the customer experience depends on how well your team executes your vision, and the wrong hire can do significant damage to your reputation.
Percy Jenkins, CEO and founder of W4 Construction Group wanted his company to be “the best of the best.” After his experiences in the Armed Forces performing search and rescue missions, he learned the value of having a team you can trust. “We had a crew of three or four people and we had to rely on each other and our training,” he says. The values of trust and loyalty are just as crucial in his business. “I have to be smart enough to surround myself with the right people,” Jenkins says.
Jenkins’ value-based hiring methods go beyond looking for trust. He recommends looking for that little something extra—passion. “I’m not a big fan of going to work for a paycheck; I want people to be on our team because they want to be.”
Mistake 3: Not standing out
Offering a unique experience is crucial for small businesses, especially if you’re going head-to-head with the big-box stores. “People’s palates have become more sophisticated, with the Food Network and foodie culture,” says Daniel Sterling, the CEO of Seattle donut startup FROST. “We try to make coming to FROST a fun experience for everyone that comes in.”
When they first opened, they rotated flavors several times a week to see what became a hit. Now, variety and novelty are part of their brand with their unique flavors being “the number one reason people come to FROST. People are used to getting interesting products from us, not your typical things,” Sterling says.
FROST releases new flavors about 10 times a year, changing the menu to suit the season and offering a little something for everyone. “We find that people get really excited about new items that come out.”
Mistake 4: Leaving out luddites in your loyalty programs
Six Beans Coffee Company offers their customers great coffee, great drinks, and super-friendly service all in about 3 minutes through a drive-through window. “We are more tailored to the commuter, the busy professional, moms, teachers—people who have stuff to do but still want really good coffee,” Co-owner Brian Nicklason says. While the concept has become very popular, their drive-through model doesn’t give them much time to develop customer relationships. Six Beans uses Clover Rewards to offer perks to loyal customers. For most customers with a smart phone the app works like a charm, but there are some customers who just aren’t comfortable using an app yet.
“Not everybody is as tech-savvy as we’d like,” Nicklason says. Rather than leave these customers out, Six Beans allows these customers to simply show their loyalty points on their receipts to claim their rewards. By offering a low-tech option, they avoid alienating a valuable segment of their customers.
Mistake 5: Not taking advantage of time savers
Tony Westenhaver, owner of Tonto Hair Salon in Denver, Colorado, is a stylist at heart. Yet, like all entrepreneurs, he struggles balancing his passion for his business with taking care of business.
“The thing about being a small business owner is that not only do I work behind the chair 50 hours a week just doing my personal business,” Tony says, “but I have the shop business to take care of as well.”
Investing in software to help him automate and simplify details like inventory and accounting saved him time so he could focus on the creative side of business. “You know, what I liked best about [Clover] is that at the end of the week, it’s the reporting processes on the machine that makes life easy for me. I can look at daily totals… weekly totals… and tax reports. There’s no question, it makes my life a lot easier. For me to spend the time I spend behind the chair, anything I can do to cut time elsewhere creates a lot less stress for me and helps to balance my life a little bit.” Automating repeatable tasks like payroll, accounting, and inventory frees you to spend time building the business.
There are a lot of moving parts when starting up a business. Don’t go it alone—Clover can help. You can take your business farther with Clover in your corner.

4 more ways to beef up your entrepreneurial business education
1. Check out your local library. While not all libraries are big enough to offer services to small businesses, libraries will often partner to offer programs available for all of their patrons. For example, if you live in a large city, such as New York City, you are likely eligible to participate in any of events designed for small businesses throughout the city. Other libraries offer their patrons access to online training such as Lynda.com. Check with your local librarian to see what you’re eligible to attend for free.
2. Find a mentor. If you’re a franchise, investigate whether there are any training or mentoring opportunities available to you. If you’re on your own, check out your local chamber of commerce to see if there are free training events or networking opportunities to help you find a mentor.
3. Associations. There are many associations such as SCORE, VISTAGE, or Startup Grind that offer opportunities to learn and network with other entrepreneurs in your area. Want more ideas? Check out this list of associations that offer resources to entrepreneurs.
4. Ask a master. Looking for specific training in your particular niche? Try finding an apprenticeship through the Department of Labor or use social media to post questions for other entrepreneurs in your area.
Don’t forget that training yourself on these tasks can be a great way to improve business and strengthen your weaknesses, but it’s not the only solution. You can also hire competent staff to complement your skillset or shore up your business with apps that make business easier. Clover’s App Market is filled with solutions to help make planning and running your business a little easier.

…",12-12-2018,https://blog.clover.com/uncategorized/small-business-loans-for-african-american-women-entrepreneurs/,"Maybe the saying should be, ‘When the going gets tough, the tough start new small businesses.’ That’s certainly been true for women of color in the past ten years—since the Great Recession of 2007-2009, African-American women have been jumping into entrepreneurship at a much faster rate than other groups. Since 2007, the number of women-owned businesses has grown by an impressive 58%, but the number of businesses owned by African-American women has grown almost three times as fast, by 164%.
Starting a new business is never easy, but taking control can be a huge power move. Whether the traditional workforce has treated you well or not, you can forge your own path to define success for yourself. Luckily, whatever your motivation for starting a business, there are plenty of resources out there to help you take it to the next level. Whether you’re starting a side gig or going for the full Madame C. J. Walker, there’s assistance out there to help you realize your dreams.
Grants
The National Association for the Self-Employed awards small grants of up to $4,000 to help small businesses finance specific needs. You have to be a dues-paying NASE member to apply— membership costs $11.95 a month or $120 a year. Applications need to show exactly how the money will be used, and how it will contribute to the overall growth of the business.
The Girlboss Foundation awards biannual grants of $15,000 to women working in design, fashion, music, or the arts. Judges are looking for creativity and innovation as well as business savvy and a clear, achievable plan for how the money will be used in the next year.
Rural Business Development Grants are awarded to businesses with fewer than 50 employees in, you guessed it, rural areas. Grants range from $10,000 to $50,000, and applications should show that the grant will help create jobs. Deadlines vary from state to state.
The Small Business Innovation Research program awards grants of up to $150,000 to businesses doing cutting-edge research with the potential for commercialization. A number of government agencies participate, including the Departments of Agriculture, Education, and Health and Human Services.
The Halstead Grant is an annual award given to an emerging jewelry designer working in silver. Very specific, yes, but if that’s you, the award is a $7,500 grant plus $1,000 in merchandise. The application deadline is August 1 every year.
Contests
Since 2013, FedEx has run a small business grant contest every year, with a grand prize of $25,000. In 2018, the contest was open to any for-profit business that had been operating for at least six months and had fewer than 99 employees. The public votes in this contest, so a great story, a video, and aggressive social media promotion will improve your chances.
The Cartier Women’s Initiative Awards make grants to women-owned businesses that are less than three years old. The judges are looking for creativity, financial sustainability, and social impact. Fourteen finalists get $30,000, and seven winners get $100,000. The next round of applications will begin in June 2019.
The Amber Grant program awards a new $1,000 grant to a woman-owned business every month. Monthly winners are then eligible for an annual $10,000 grant. The judges for the monthly grants are looking for passion and a great story. The annual award includes a public voting component.
Loans
The Small Business Administration runs several programs that help connect businesses with loans, including the 7(a) loan program, a microloan program, and the Community Advantage program for businesses in underserved communities. See what you qualify for and get started with their online LenderMatch tool.
Accion is a nonprofit organization that makes loans to small businesses. Loans can range up to $1 million, and they have specific programs targeting women-owned and minority-owned businesses. They don’t look only at credit scores, and they make an effort to loan to businesses who’ve had trouble getting traditional bank loans.
Union Bank has loan programs for both minority-owned and women-owned businesses. Borrowers must have been in business for at least two years and have annual sales of less than $20 million.
The Tory Burch Foundation Capital Program helps women entrepreneurs who’ve been in business for at least two years access small business loans. The Foundation screens potential borrowers and then connects them to Community Lenders to formally apply for loans.
The Business Center for New Americans makes loans of up to $50,000 to businesses located in New York City. They don’t have a minimum credit score requirement, but they do require business owners to have a plan for how they will pay off a loan.
Angel and Venture Capital Investors
If you’re looking for investors, there are a number of venture capital firms and angel investing networks that focus on women- or minority-owned businesses. 37 Angels, for example, invests $50,000 to $150,000 in selected companies. Golden Seeds invests in technology, health care, and consumer products and services. Chloe Capital invests in high-tech companies led by women. Belle Capital invests mainly in technology companies in underserved markets.
Intel Capital’s Diversity Initiative targets high-tech companies run by minorities. Kapor Capital invests in early-stage tech-driven companies aimed at closing a gap of access, opportunity, or outcome for communities of color and low-income communities. PowerMoves offers entrepreneurs of color boot camps, an accelerator, and opportunities to pitch investors. Keep in mind that investors will be looking for companies with the potential to scale up big—and they’ll own a piece of your business, of course!
Starting a new business is challenging, but you don’t have to go it alone. There are a lot of resources out there that are specifically designed to help entrepreneurs like you build sustainable businesses.

…",19-12-2018,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/must-reads-on-small-business-planning-in-2018/,"Bells are jingling, and trees are lit. Soon, many of us will sing Auld Lang Syne as we pack away 2018, break out the bubbly, and welcome 2019.
In the thick of holiday transactions and year-end reporting, many merchants struggle to find time to think forward to 2019, much less plan for it. But as the old adage goes, failing to plan is planning to fail.
To help merchants step ahead of holiday to-dos and into 2019, we’ve compiled our best strategic planning content for easy perusal.
The Plan
A strategic plan may sound like something found on the desk of a 5-star general or the CEO of an international firm. True. But it should also be on the desktop, wall, or device of every small business owner.
Why? Because a strategic plan charts a course to a goal, whether for a military maneuver, major acquisition, or small business. And it serves to guide and remind leaders of that goal.
Fortunately, building a strategic plan is within every merchant’s grasp simply by considering the following 6 areas. To help you on your way to a plan, be sure to read this guide to strategic planning for small businesses and 8 tips to help small businesses with successful strategic planning.
1. SWOT Analysis
Before business owners can build a strategic plan, they need to know exactly how their businesses are faring. Enter SWOT, a simple acronym for 4 areas that every business owner should assess to determine the state of the business: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

For inspiration on the productivity improvements you can target and how to make them in 2019, take a look at this concise guide to increasing productivity.

5. Customers
Customers are indispensable to a business’ health and one of the most important considerations on its strategic plan. Unfortunately, many businesses get so involved in daily chores, they overlook the customer’s experience. Further, some businesses fall into the trap of thinking existing customers are easily replaced by new ones. Not so. For a realistic perspective on the value of each customer, business owners must first understand customer lifetime value (LCV), how to calculate it, and why it matters.
And while holiday crowds are bustling, whether in your shop or on your website, it’s the perfect time to turn holiday shoppers into loyal customers by introducing tactics that help you engage and connect with your customers beyond that initial holiday transaction.
How can you engage customers?

Learn what your VIP customer feedback is telling you
Harness the power of customer testimonials

Offer affordable perks to attract key customer types

And Restaurants Owners can:

Build a loyalty program: How this Clover café built a killer customer loyalty program
Turn a bad experience or an endless wait into an all-star opportunity

6. Measurement
Understanding how profitable your business is means more than staying on top of the bottom line. Numbers called key performance indicators (KPIs) indicate the health of your business and identify potential risks before they’re realized. Whether it’s determining your average ticket size, conversion rate, or customer acquisition cost, your KPIs can help you manage your cash flow and determine if your marketing efforts warrant the time and dollars you’ve invested in them. Learn more about how to measure your business health with these 9 numbers.

First of all, thank you. Thank you for being a part of the Clover community and for sharing all your thoughts on how to make our products better for you. We’ve moved a few mountains in the last twelve months, and that means good things for your business and your customers. I’d like to share some of the big moments of 2018, because you helped make many of them happen.
2018 has been a year of continuous innovation and improvement. Based on your feedback, we invested heavily in the functionality and reliability of our core infrastructure and expanded our set of features that come standard on all Clover POS systems: 

New and improved Web dashboard and reporting features
Multi-location inventory and reporting
Web-based virtual terminal
Integrated customer engagement services via Promos, Feedback, and Rewards

We have also:

Redesigned our merchant portal
Overhauled our Help Center, so you can get the info you need faster
Enhanced our Clover Go app
Expanded our payment capabilities, and…
Fixed bugs

Elevating our merchants’ stories
Our merchants are smart, hardworking, savvy, and demanding–and I love that. Serving merchants like you is why I started Clover in the first place. It’s your enterprising spirit that encourages all of us here to do our best work.  Powering hundreds of thousands of small businesses and millions of customer transactions is a huge responsibility that we don’t take lightly. In fact, I consider it a privilege to do work I deeply care about every day.
That’s why listening and talking to you is such an important part of our job. These conversations happen on the Clover Help Center, through social media posts, and through business tips published weekly right here on the Clover blog.
This year, we started a significant new endeavor that will get even more exciting in 2019. We launched a series of videos featuring you, our Clover merchants. These are stories of how you got started and how you run your businesses, a little better, smarter, and more efficiently each day. Business owners learn a lot from talking to each other, and we’re facilitating those conversations by creating a space for merchants tell their stories. So take a moment out of your day and check out the videos—and stay tuned for more information on how to submit your own story for consideration in a future Clover video.
Clover Station: The second generation
Clover Station, which many of you use, is the point of sale device that marked our entry into the market in 2014.  Since then, we’ve launched a number of other devices to complement Station, including Clover Flex and Clover Mini. 
Last year, I had my team ramp up work on an even more powerful version of the original Station. The result was the second-generation Clover Station that launched this year, our first major refresh of a Clover device. We added the features you’ve been requesting the most, like a larger screen, a customer facing display, and a chip card reader. 
These improvements are delivering the speed and flexibility you asked for to run your business smarter and more efficiently, on a daily basis. They’re also the types of features that let you customize your setup to meet your specific business needs. Delivering a POS that can support these aspirations for our merchants was a highlight of our year.
Clover Dining: making dining unforgettable
As I mentioned above, we take your input seriously. So when we heard those of you in the full service restaurant space share the frustration of staffing and scheduling, managing tables, splitting bills, and the varying demands of your guests, we went to work.
This October we debuted Clover Dining, designed with the input of over 100 restaurants. Easy to download from the Clover App Market, Clover Dining gives you these critical features:

Tableside service: take orders and payments directly at the table using Clover Flex
Custom floor plans: create your unique floorplan on your Clover device
Table management: keep track of tables and orders, and enable staff to respond quickly to changing scenarios on the floor in real time
Shift management: optimize staffing workflows and payroll services via our integrated partner apps

I’m looking forward to hearing more from those of you in the restaurant business about how you like Clover Dining and what other features you’d like to see that would help you run your restaurant better.
New platform partnerships
We’ve always been proud of the Clover App Market. Here you can find a wide array of apps that address all manner of business needs and challenges, work seamlessly with your POS systems, and are simple to use.
But we’re bringing you an even richer App Market experience in 2019. We’ve integrated critical apps directly into our devices and are taking a more open approach to POS innovation by forging partnerships with best-in-class products and companies. Bringing in more apps with strong functionality and relevance in those functionality categories you need and care about will help make running your business easier and more efficient.
We’ve kicked off this shift with three of our partners: Gusto, which automates payroll processes; Nav, which helps merchants manage their business finances; and AP Intego, which provides insurance for small businesses. We’re working on more of these types of integrations for 2019.
More milestones to celebrate
This year we celebrated the shipping of our millionth Clover device to a pharmacy in Germany, and of the million-and-first to a restaurant right in the metro Atlanta backyard of our parent company, First Data.
We also launched Clover in four new countries: Germany, Austria, Argentina, and Canada. I’m excited that we’re able to help small businesses globally. Great ideas often come from seeing the familiar in new contexts, and I think having our development teams solve similar but distinct problems—distinct because of culture, geography, and business practices—will enhance our creativity and innovation, which can only benefit our merchants no matter where in the world you operate.
We’re living in a world where small businesses are competing with the “global conglomerate next door” to deliver the kinds of convenient and tech-forward experiences customers have come to expect, and the large companies can more easily deliver. Our growing global reach helps us make that happen for you.
* * *
These are just a few of our highlights from 2018. Looking back at this year, I’ve been amazed with what our team has been able to accomplish. Each day here at Clover brings a few challenges and lots of small wins that add up to the big ones. We’re proud to be working at the cutting edge in the point-of-sale space, and we’re looking forward to doing our very best to make 2019 one of your very best.

This post helps merchants calculate the key performance indicators that can give you a deeper understanding of your business…,06-01-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-measure-your-business-health-with-these-9-numbers/,"What are some best practices of large corporations that smaller businesses can scale down and make work for them? Visit the Clover blog’s “Enterprise Behavior” topic page for more!
Making a profit is about more than watching the bottom line. There are a number of other figures–often called key performance indicators (or KPIs) in large enterprises–that you should monitor to make sure the financial health of your business is on track. KPIs help you measure whether you have enough cash on hand to operate; can help you identify what aspects of your business you might need to address to hit your goals; and can assist you in determining whether your marketing and promotions are worth the time and expense.
Read on to learn about some KPIs you might find it helpful to track.
1. Profit margin

Type of number: %
How it’s calculated: Subtract your business’s total expenditures from your total revenue. This is your net income. Then divide your net income by your total revenue to determine your profit margin.
Total Income: $100,000
 Expenses: $80,000
 Net income ($) = $100,000 – $80,000 = $20,000
 Profit margin (%) = $20,000/$100,000 = 20%
What it tells you: Profit margin tells you how much profit your business made in terms of the total revenue your business has earned. If your profit margin is 20%, for example, that means your business kept $0.20, after expenses, for every dollar that came through the door.
How to use it: To the average person, earning a million dollars in a year might sound great. But business owners know that it’s not just how you make: it’s also how much you keep. Calculating your profit margin helps you understand, in a single number, how much profit your business is generating at various revenue levels (or, seen another way, how much profit your business is generating at various expenditure levels).
2. Average ticket size

Type of number: $
How it’s calculated: Divide the total receipts for a given period by the number of customer visits in that same period.
Last month’s total receipt amount: $31,725
 Last month’s total customers visits: 1,410
 Last month’s average ticket size ($) = $31,725/1,410 visits = $22.50 per visit
What it tells you: In literal terms, the average ticket size is the average amount a customer or party spends in one visit. This number can tell you how many monthly, daily–even hourly–visits you’ll need to attract on average in order to hit a given revenue goal.
How to use it: Falling short of your revenue target? This number is one tool in your arsenal that can help you begin to understand where to focus your efforts to boost revenues. You might choose to focus on strategies that get more customers through your doors, with an emphasis on acquiring new customers (perhaps with a marketing campaign) or encouraging repeat visits (perhaps with a loyalty program). Or you night choose to focus on strategies that encourage each customer to spend a little more money per visit, like training your sales staff to upsell or putting impulse buys near your register or in your website checkout experience.

Clover customers, be sure to look at this figure in the Clover Insights App. Not only will it calculate your average ticket size automatically, it lets you compare your average ticket size to the same figure for other local businesses in your area, or to similar businesses in different cities.
3. Average daily/weekly/monthly transactions

Type of number: #
How it’s calculated: Divide the total number of transactions by the total number of days/weeks/months in a given period.
Total transactions: 500
Total days in measurement period: 7  (one week)
Average daily transactions: = 500/7 = 71.43 = 71 transactions per day 
What it tells you: Average transactions is a figure that reflects the average number of sales your business makes in given period of time. This number is particularly useful when it is tracked over time.
You might observe, for example, that traffic spikes on weekdays or weekends (learn this from average daily transactions); that it is more pronounced during the first and third weeks of the month, perhaps corresponding to paydays (learn this from average weekly transactions); and/or that there is a noticeable difference in traffic depending on the month of the year (learn this from average monthly transactions).
There are other ways you can use transactions depending on your type of business. You might measure average transactions during the school year versus the summertime. If your business is located near a major sports or entertainment venue, it might be useful to measure average transactions on event nights versus non-event nights. Selling ice cream, soup or hot/cold drinks? You might even find it useful to measure your traffic based on the temperature!

How to use it: Understanding how traffic ebbs and flows might inspire you to take proactive measures to increase traffic to your business during slow periods, like switching up your inventory when the season changes, or offering specials during historically slow times to get more people through your doors.

This data can also help you make decisions about when it might make sense to staff up or down, or how to manage your cash flow so that you have cash on hand when traffic–and thus revenues–will be low.

4. Conversion rate

Type of number: %
How it’s calculated: Conversation rates can be applied to a number of different contexts in the life of your business–more on that in a moment. In general, this number refers to how many people take an action versus how many people were eligible to take an action. Let’s look at a couple of examples so that you see what we mean:
Digital coupon downloads: 100
 Digital coupon redemptions: 20
 Digital coupon conversion rate: 20%
Weekly email offer clicks: 861
 Weekly email offer sales: 17
 Weekly email offer conversion rate: 2%
What it tells you: Conversion rate reflects how many prospects turn into actual customers. In a nutshell, it indicates the effectiveness of your outreach and/or the desirability of your deal.
How to use it: This figure is particularly useful for helping you to measure your marketing and promotion activity. If some coupons have higher conversion rates than others, you might draw meaningful conclusions about:

Relative desirability of different deals
Perceived value of the discount amount or promotion
Effectiveness of redemption criteria
Positioning of the sale, deal or item
Effectiveness of the audience or placement: is the offer, pricing and/or promoted item or service ideal for the website, online targeting or mailing list where the offer was placed?

5. Average customer lifetime value

Number type: $
How to calculate it: This number is the amount of money the average customer will spend over a lifetime of transacting with your business. Arriving at this figure requires you to use a mix of real business data and sound assumptions. There are a number of methods for estimating this figure. Here’s one of the simpler ones:
Step 1. Calculate average customer value per month: average ticket size per customer (see average ticket size above) X average visits per customer each month
Step 2. Estimate the average customer lifespan, or how much time you think will elapse between when a customer starts visiting your business and when they will stop. This can be a tough number to estimate, but not always. For example, if you run a pizza shop located on a college campus that serves mostly college students, you might reasonably estimate average customer lifespan to be 4 to 5 years.
Step 3: Calculate the customer lifetime value = average customer value per month (Step 1) X 12 X your estimate for the average customer lifespan (Step 2)
Let’s break this down using our college pizza restaurant to illustrate the calculation:
Average customer value per month = $8 average ticket size per customer * 3 average visits per customer each month = $24
Average customer lifespan = 4.5 years
Lifetime value per customer = $24 X 12 (months in a year) X 4.5 = $1,296
What it tells you: Lifetime value is a measure of how much money the average customer will ever spend at your business. The average customer at our campus pizza shop, for example, will spend $1,296 over the course of their time as a customer.
How to use it: This is a great number to help you determine reasonable marketing costs, and the effectiveness of your marketing programs. If your average customer will spend $1,300 with your business over a lifetime, a $1,500 advertising buy that nets one customer will have clearly failed.
But seen another way, this number might also inspire you to be more generous with your marketing budget. If your average customer will spend $1300 with you in a lifetime, but only $24 in the first month, then spending $50 to acquire them is not a failure–especially if they’re a freshman in our campus pizza shop example.

Without understanding the potential lifetime value of a new customer, you might mistakenly conclude that your marketing has failed in the first month, when it fact it will pay dividends over the customer lifetime.
6. Customer acquisition cost

Type of number: $
How to calculate it: Advertising/promotion/PR budget divided by total customers acquired as a result of those actions.
Total marketing budget: $1,000
Total customers resulting from marketing: 20
Customer acquisition cost = $1,000/20 = $50
What it tells you: This number tells you how much money it cost for you to attract one new customer on average.
How to use it: Use this number to determine whether your marketing budget is sensible. A profitable marketing campaign will incur a customer acquisition cost that is a fraction of that customer’s lifetime value. It’s also a reminder that if you’re marketing to promote long-term business growth (as opposed to specific campaigns or events), you should avoid constraining your view of the effect of your marketing to a month or two–unless that’s the approximate lifespan of your customers.
7. Spend rate (burn rate)

Type of number: $
How to calculate it: Divide average spend over a period of time by the total number of that unit of time. Put plainly:
Total spend: $10,000
 Total days: 30
 Daily spend rate/burn rate: $333
Total spend: $120,000
 Total months: 12
 Monthly spend rate/burn rate: $10,000
What it tells you: This number indicates the rate at which you’re burning through your capital.
How to use it: Put simply, if you understand this number, you can determine how long it will be until you run out of cash or, put another way, how long you’ll have before you need to make a profit. Once you are profitable, it’s still important to keep track of your spend rate—your average costs in a month—to make sure you are earning enough to stay in the black and turn a profit.
8. Revenue growth rate

Type of number: $
How to calculate: Subtract your total revenue in the older year from the total revenue in the more recent year. Divide the result by the total revenue from the older year. You can also do this calculation month-to-month, although your results may be deceptive due to seasonality. The yearly calculation will smooth over these variations. Looking at yearlong spans will also enable you to compare the same months from different years to isolate year-over-year growth.
Revenue last year (more recent year): $1,500,000
 Revenue year before last (older year): $1,250,000
 Revenue growth rate: ($1,500,000-$1,250,00)/$1,250,000 = 0.2 = 20% year-over-year growth rate (note following this formula exactly will yield a negative growth rate to reflect any year-over-year declines)
What it tells you: Understand how raw sales are trending over time.
How to use it: If you spot year-over-year declines–for example, revenues this September were 10 percent lower than revenues last September–you should look deeper into your data to understand whether this is just a temporary decline (and what drove it), or whether you should brace yourself for lower revenues indefinitely.
9. Revenue forecast

Type of number: $
How to calculate it: In essence, you’re summarizing previous revenue trends in your business, including historic monthly revenue and revenue growth or decline over time, and using that data to make an educated guess as to how much revenue your business will earn in the future. Revenue forecasting models can be incredibly complex and take into account variables like seasonality and external market conditions.
For example: Your corner cafe has earned $35,000 per month for the last 12 month. You might apply a modest growth rate to that number to estimate your revenue for next year. But a corporate anchor tenant is scheduled to move into a brand new high-rise office tower across the street the next month. That fact might have a more significant impact on revenue than your historic performance the previous year.
Now imagine that same office tower includes a ground-floor coffee chain. This fact might affect your revenue further still.
Accounting and business analytics tools, such as Clover Insights, can help you quickly look at your historical sales information, and your current average daily revenue, and estimate how much you’ll make this month or this year.
What it tells you: This figure gives you a sense of how much your business can expect to earn in the future
How to use it: Use this number to help you make educated decisions about your expenditures and predict your future profitability. This number can also help you make longer-term decisions about details like staffing, budgeting and inventory. Be attentive to whether your actual revenue deviates significantly from this number, and why. If you understand this, you may become more adept at making projections in the future.

news_444,news,Are you controlling for these 10 small business risks?,"Roughly 20% of small businesses fail in their first year of operation, and about 50% fail within five years. If you want your business to beat those odds, you’ve got to manage risk. 

…",07-01-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/are-you-controlling-for-these-10-small-business-risks/,"Roughly 20% of small businesses fail in their first year of operation, and about 50% fail within five years, according to the Small Business Administration. If you want your business to beat those odds, you’ve got to manage risk. Here are 10 common risks small businesses face, and what to do about them:
1. Theft and security breaches
‘Shrink’—the industry term for losses due to theft—costs retailers about 1.33% of sales, on average, according to the National Retail Federation. But a growing number of retailers report that shrink costs them more than 2% of sales, and, in 2018, one-third of reported robberies resulted in losses of $10,000 or more. Keep your business on the good side of these statistics by carefully monitoring your inventory, tweaking the design of your store to ensure employees can keep an eye on shoppers, and following some other simple loss-prevention strategies.
Cyber security is another huge risk for small businesses: 43% of cyber-attacks target small businesses. Human error can be a huge factor in cyber-security incidents, so make sure your whole team knows how to create a strong password, avoid phishing attacks, and follow other cyber-security best practices. A secure payment system is crucial, of course, and Clover’s security is state-of-the-art.
2. Lawsuits and liability
A fired employee sues you for wrongful termination. An employee gets hurt on the job—or a customer gets injured in your store. Lawsuits are one of the biggest risks small businesses face. Make sure you have the insurance you need to protect against these risks. Workers’ compensation requirements vary state to state, but general business liability insurance is always a good bet. You can also consider a business owner policy, which combines property, liability, and other useful types of insurance into one package.
3. Natural disasters
What if a hurricane forces you to shut your shop down for a week? What if your store catches fire, or an extended power outage makes it impossible to run your business normally? Business interruption insurance can help cover these types of risk. This type of policy should cover not just physical damage, but lost profits as well.
4. Recession
The state of the economy is out of your control, of course. But there are some things you can do to recession-proof your business. Focus on cash flow—make sure you have enough cash on hand to get through a lean period. Manage your inventory carefully, because storing a lot of unused inventory costs you money. If you think a downturn may be on the way, avoid making big cash commitments. If you need to cut costs, try cutting employees’ hours before you lay people off—that way, you can be quick to respond when the economy starts to improve.
5. Changing competition
You can’t control what your competitors do, either, but you can respond quickly when the competitive landscape changes. Clover Insights can show you how your daily and weekly sales and average ticket sizes compare to similar businesses in your area. If a new competitor opens nearby, figure out what’s unique about your offering and focus on that, rather than rushing to cut costs. Use a rewards program to reward your best customers for sticking with you.
6. Operational risk
Operational risk is basically the risk that your business isn’t functioning as well as it could be—for example, that you’re managing inventory poorly or running out of cash every month. You control for this type of risk by making sure you implement strong systems to run your business and train your employees to follow these systems. For example, an app like Time Clock by Homebase can streamline scheduling staff and make running payroll easier. DAVO can automate the process of collecting and paying sales tax, so you never miss a deadline. Automating business processes like these is a great way to reduce human error.
7. Changes in your customer base
What happens if the demographics in your neighborhood shift, and your foot traffic starts to slow down as a result? What if your biggest customer decides to cut costs or take their business elsewhere? What if a bad online review starts to turn customers off? The best strategy for controlling for this type of risk is to diversify your customer base as much as possible. Ramp up your marketing, and make sure you’re active on social media. Use apps like Yelp for Business to monitor your reviews online, and give customers a way to connect with you directly through an app like Feedback, so they won’t feel they have to take their concerns to social media.
8. Subpar employees
According to a recent survey, attracting and retaining great talent is one of the top five risks business owners are most worried about. Business owners also see a changing future workforce as one of the biggest risks they’ll face in the next five years. If you’re looking to hire, an app like Hiring can help simplify the process, and HR Resources can help you keep on top of retention strategies like performance reviews. Keep in mind that employee satisfaction depends on more than just salary—look for some low-cost perks you can offer to keep your staff happy.
9. Growing pains
Growth is great—except when you sell out of your most popular product, take on too much debt to fuel your growth, or you add a second location and it struggles to make its targets. Grow smart by keeping an eye on your debt-to-equity ratio. Consider testing a new location with a pop-up before you fully commit. Use a customer relations management app like CRM to let your best customers know about your plans to grow and recruit them to try a new product or location.
10. You
Many small business owners try to do it all. Maybe you were your business’s only employee for a while, or maybe you just worry that nobody else can meet your standards. But relying too much on any one person—even if that person is you—creates risk for your business. You could get sick, or simply burn out. Learn to delegate so that you can take regular breaks. Create a succession plan so you know your business will be in good hands when it’s time for you to retire or move on. And protect yourself, and your business, against a worst-case scenario with disability insurance.

We are here to guide you through the five questions you should be asking yourself before opening a permanent retail location. 
…",10-01-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-decide-if-your-pop-up-is-ready-for-a-permanent-location/,"It’s 2019 and you’ve made a promise to finally put action behind the goal of owning your own store one day. You’ve done your research, you’ve tested the market through pop-ups, and now you wonder if it’s time to open a permanent space. This post will guide you through five questions to ask yourself before opening up your doors to a permanent retail location.
1. How important is your product to your core audience?
After launching your product you now can identify who your target consumer is and your plan to get in front of more people like this. You can tell if your product is ready for its own store if your shoppers have become mini evangelist—singing your praises without having to be paid. After the consumer makes their purchase, their tendency to refer friends or repeat business is a great indicator of loyalty/success.
When in doubt, target consumers through cost effective marketing efforts. Some inexpensive marketing tips to get you going are social media marketing both organic/paid advertising, loyalty programs like Clover Rewards, word of mouth marketing and local events. Brand loyalty can come in many different forms, but ultimately is a crucial part of starting any new business.
2. Do you have the proper team to bring your vision to life?
The reality is you can’t do everything yourself. You are the expert, but often times in order to execute your vision properly you are going to need some help. With the understanding that budgets will be tight starting off, accomplish as much as you can by yourself and hire against your skillset. When you have the proper team in place it allows you as the visionary to focus on the bigger picture like PR/Marketing, sponsorships, volunteers, tying loose ends etc. A team allows you as the owner to be clear-minded as the stress/anxiety of opening day approaches.
3. What KPI’s (key performance indicators) do you use to measure success?
It takes a long time to measure success and you want to make sure you’ve taken everything into consideration. Test your product/brand in different seasons, work with different partners, and consider which KPI’s will be used to determine success.
Some of key performance indicators to consider are:

Profit Margin
Average Ticket Size
Average/Daily/Weekly/Monthly transactions
Conversion Rate
Location

4. Will I have trouble maintaining inventory?
If you’ve traditionally sold your product online, in pop-up shops, or through other retailers, the volume becomes entirely different when you have your own store. A bigger store means bigger inventory and detailed management. Smart POS systems allow you to seamlessly check inventory through technology that informs you when your shelves are low on a particular product, prior to doing a physical count. These systems also tell you which of your products are selling the most/least, further informing you on what to produce more or less frequently.
5. Do I know the best space for a retail location?
Even if you have the best product and a loyal following, location can make a huge difference when transitioning from pop-up shop to retail store. If you’re able to find something roughly in the same location as your successful pop-up, you’ve hit the jackpot! But chances are, you’ll need to make some adjustments. Do your competitor research, check Clover Insights, and consult with advisers to make sure you’re going to the right place at the right time.

news_448,news,Growing pains: Does your business need a bigger space or more locations?,"Explosive growth is a good problem to have—but a problem nonetheless. If your business is booming, it may be time to expand. Should you grow to a second location, or increase your footprint right where you are? Here’s how to decide if you need a bigger space, or more locations.…",23-01-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-does-your-business-need-a-bigger-space-or-more-locations/,"Does it feel like the holiday rush has just…not stopped? The holiday season may be over, but if your business feels busier than ever, this demand may be your new normal. Retail business owners that face explosive growth often find themselves with a physical space issue on their hands—a good problem, to be sure, but a problem nonetheless. Is it time to expand, and if so, do you need a second location?
If this sounds like you, there are some quantifiable ways to determine whether you need a bigger space or a second location. Get the data points you need to grow and thrive. Here are some ways to make this big—and very exciting—decision.
Be sure you’re at max capacity.
Before diving into a real estate search or knocking down any walls, make sure you’re maximizing the space you already have. To do this, figure out your sales per square foot. Use this formula to calculate:
Sales Volume ÷ Sales per Square Foot = Selling Space
Knowing your ideal selling space can give you a benchmark by which to make your decision. The higher your dollar per square foot, the better.
Then, use your sales per square foot to benchmark against others in your industry. To find data to compare with your figure, check out similar businesses using Clover Insights, ask retail trade associations or trade analysts, or do some research at the public library. If your sales number seems low for the amount of space you already have, consider reconfiguring your store layout, upselling, or item bundling.
Is your increased demand specific to your location?
Once you’ve ascertained that you’ve gotten the most bang for your buck in your current space, the question remains: what’s the best way to branch out? Should you find more space, or open a second location?
Use your sales per square foot equation to work backwards and figure out how much more space you need to reach a certain profit mark. You don’t want too much space, as your store might look empty and less inviting. However, too little space can feel cramped and crowded—also not appealing. Need just a few extra feet? See if you can expand the footprint of your current location or stay in the same area. Experts say location trumps size every time. Staying in the same area reduces your advertising costs—you won’t need to start from scratch to get customers to find you.
Dig into what makes your first location successful. Are you near a transit hub, or a convenient intersection? Has word spread in the neighborhood that you are the best at what you do? Is there limited competition? If these answers are all yes, it may be better to expand your space but keep it where it is. Clover Insights can surface your business’s specific characteristics and provide you deep understanding of where the best location might be relative to your existing customers.
Are you ready to make the leap toward a second location?
If you need a lot more space, and your success isn’t specific to your location, then open another shop! Once you decide you need a second location, there’s a whole new set of questions to consider.
Use the estimate of the size of the square footage you need to do some cost-benefit analysis. See how much more in sales (revenue) you will need to cover things like rent or mortgage on the second location, a second manager or team of staff, and increased inventory costs. Opening a second location comes with a lot of overhead costs: can your increased demand cover those costs and still leave you with a profit? Don’t forget to include in your rent estimate things like the cost of utilities, maintenance, property insurance or fees and possible rent increases.
Many retailers are financially ready to invest in an expansion, but may not be business-ready. Make a hiring plan, think about how you will keep your company culture consistent, and build your brand outreach before opening in a new place. Better yet? Try a pop-up.
Try before you buy.
Many retailers find it helpful to double-check their own business assumptions with a temporary pop-up shop. This can be a good way to explore a new neighborhood and see if increased demand is sustainable.
A pop-up shop is also a way to see how steep competition is in your new location. Analyze your competition with this handy guide to see if the demand you’ve come to expect will be as consistent and reliable as in your first location. If it doesn’t seem like your business is easily replicable in a new neighborhood, scale back and keep doing what’s already working!

news_449,news,How and why to improve SEO for your business website,"Want to get more traffic to your website? We’ve broken SEO down into three simple strategies with actionable steps to improve your website’s ranking quickly, including advice on how to focus your efforts on the visitors most likely to buy from you. Learn more.
…",01-02-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-improve-website-seo/,"Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing the content and navigation on your website to improve its ranking on search engine results pages. Whether you run a restaurant, retail shop or service-based business, effective SEO can help your business rank highly in search results when people search for the items or services you offer using Google, Bing, or other search engines.
Why is this so important? Searching online is a predominant way that consumers find restaurants, shops and services in their locale. And according to Advanced Web Ranking, the website in the first position on Google’s desktop search results enjoys a 34.36 percent click-through rate—that is, more than one in three people who see the page will click on that result—which can mean a significant increase in traffic to your business’s website. Google’s research reveals that local searches lead 50 percent of mobile visitors to visit a store within one day. Effective SEO can be a powerful way to capture some of the foot traffic that results from those online searches.
In general, search engines reward websites whose content is highly relevant to online users and that is easy to use and navigate. Factors they use to make that determination about your website include:

How long people stay on your website and how many pages they view per session
Whether people are sharing your content on social media
Your website’s load speed
Whether other websites link back to yours—a measure of your online “authority”
Whether your site is mobile responsive: that is, whether the pages are optimized to be viewed on a mobile phone

Here are a few ways to improve SEO for your business’s website.
Get into the minds of your customers.
Much of the advice for SEO can be distilled into this single sentence: think like your customers. If your website is useful to consumers, their behaviors will earn you good SEO rankings. Ask yourself: what phrases will potential customers use when searching for my business or products? What kinds of searches will they perform before making the decision to buy? If you were your customer, would you find the content on your site so irresistible that you’d share it with your family and friends? Let’s break this down:

Choose “long-tail,” search-friendly keyword phrases. “Long tail” searches refer to search terms that include more words and detail. “Coffee shop” is a generic keyword. “Best coffee shop in Haworth, NJ” is a longer tail keyword. In general, there is less competition for long tail keywords, increasing the likelihood that you will show up first on the search results page for these less frequently searched, but much more specific, phrases. What’s more, if you include the phrase “best coffee shop in Haworth, NJ” in your website, you are also optimizing your site for shorter search terms like “coffee shop” and “Haworth, NJ.” Think about which keyword phrases people might type in order find your business, and what additional words people might use to search for what you offer. For example, “fast coffee shops in Haworth, NJ” or “organic coffee shops in Haworth, NJ” might be strong options to include on your website.
Make your content sharable. Social media is here to stay—and a relatively cheap way to get word of mouth going about your business. But a social media marketing strategy works best if customers are inspired to share your content. People (and other websites) share content for all sorts of reasons, and you don’t have to include slick or gimmicky content to make it shareable. If your website offers the best article on how to choose a particular product, how to use products safely and effectively, or is just the best collection of curated links from other resources, you can increase your likelihood of receiving backlinks from other websites. You can also create shareable content by offering a tempting promotion, beautiful photographs, funny videos of your staff, or contests. The key to being shareable is creating content that is valuable and/or interesting to the viewer.

Think local.
Given how many websites there are in the world, it can be difficult to compete if your SEO strategy is too broad. Don’t try to be everything to everyone—you’ll be expending a lot of effort and not necessarily getting the return you’re looking for. Instead, focus on being discovered by those people most likely to purchase from you—those potential customers looking at their phones right on your block. Customers are often looking for nearby businesses or researching products while out shopping. Make sure your business is found locally using a few quick tips:

Register your business with the most common search engines and map services like Google My Business, Apple Maps, and Yelp. With 142 million users every month, Yelp and other review sites should be an important part of your strategy. Some tools can help make sure small business information is up to date on the most popular online business directories like Yelp and TripAdvisor, all from a single dashboard. By centralizing your updates, you can avoid inaccuracies that can negatively affect search results and frustrate potential customers into choosing a competitor.
Include all contact information on directories and review sites including your phone number, website, address, directions as well as links to things like menus or other popular content. You should also make sure that your telephone number is prominently listed on each page of your website.
Emphasize location in your keywords and metadata. Use your location in your title description and in metadata on your site. It will help bump your site in local searches.

Think ‘fast.’
Some researchers claim that you have about 15 seconds to capture the attention of the average visitor online. Customers want what they want, they want it now, and they are liable to click away if they don’t immediately see something of interest. With that in mind:

Invest in a good user experience. Search engines take note if they send traffic to a site and the visitor immediately clicks away. So if you created content advertising the best celebrity tattoos, but a visitor doesn’t see anything relevant to that promise when they visit your site, there’s a good chance they will leave your site. Take a hard look at your ads and content—do they match? Will visitors get what they expect when they visit to your site? Make sure your ads are relevant and deliver on user expectations to improve overall user experience. Also consider whether the site is designed in a way that encourages visitors to explore it, and whether it is easy to browse products and to make a purchase. Remember, your first goal is to get potential customers to discover you, but your immediate second goal is to get them interested in buying from you. Make it easy.
Make sure your website is mobile friendly. If someone searches for a shoe store on their phone, Google knows that search was made on a mobile device. Because Google wants that user to have a good experience, they prioritize shoe store websites that are optimized for mobile. If your website isn’t mobile friendly, you may be losing an important segment of potential customers. Many website builders automatically optimize the mobile version of your website.

news_450,news,5 questions to ask when sales are down,"When running a business there are many things to account for in ensuring the success of your venture. In any business slow sales are inevitable, but we’re here to guide you through the uncertainty by providing you with five questions to ask yourself when sales are down.
…",05-02-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-when-sales-are-down/,"When running a business, there are many things to account for in ensuring the success of your venture. As a business owner your focus tends to primarily be on how to grow and what it will take to reach the next milestone. However, like most things in life there will be ebbs and flows. We’re here to guide you through the uncertainty by providing you with five questions to ask yourself when you’re in a slump and sales are down.
1. What factors have contributed to slow sales?
This would be the time to do some internal digging to understand what may have changed in the past couple of weeks/months to contribute to the low sales. Did you increase your prices? If you own a restaurant did you change the menu? How has the weather been lately? Sometimes even the slightest difference can trigger your consumers positively and/or negatively. A good way to find out what’s going on is to survey your customers to understand their desires. You can also use Clover Insights to identify trends. Perhaps this time was also slow last year?
2. How can social media increase sales?
It’s time to get creative! Think about ways in which you can use social media marketing to increase sales. Have team brainstorms on past strategies that have worked and ways in which you can build momentum. Try re-introducing yourself to new followers. Paid advertising is also a great tool that can increase sales dramatically if used correctly.

3. Which partnerships can be created to drive traffic?
Partnerships are a great way to build brand recognition and loyalty. Think of possible micro-influencers you can collaborate with to help you spread the work. Search hashtags related to your industry and find people that are already in the space. These influencers are more likely to form partnerships and bring their followers to you organically.

4. Are there special offers you can create for customers?
Exclusive deals can peek interest when your company is experiencing downturn. Think of discounts, bundles, exclusive offers you can use to get people through the doors. Sales on lower performing inventory allows you to promote an exciting offer and get rid of stagnant inventory.
5. Is an updated website and/or store design necessary?
Media is constantly changing, so take a look at your designs to see if you are staying current to existing trends. Outdated media can turn customers away if your creative isn’t up to date or on par with your competitors. Look to make changes to your designs quarterly. Most companies create according to the seasons and holidays. Use this timeline as a framework when looking for ideas to get started.

news_451,news,Merchant talkback: What’s the sweet spot for your return policy?,"Designing a return policy for your small business can be tricky. You may be worried about creating a too-generous policy that leaves you stuck with unsellable inventory. But making returns too difficult can discourage potential customers from making a purchase at all.
…",06-02-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/merchant-talkback-whats-the-sweet-spot-for-your-returns-policy/,"Designing a return policy for your small business can be tricky. If your margins are thin, you may be worried about creating a too-generous policy that leaves you stuck with unsellable inventory. On the other hand, making returns too difficult can discourage potential customers from making a purchase in the first place.
Surveys have consistently found that return policies factor into consumers’ shopping decisions, particularly when it comes to shopping online. About 4 in 10 shoppers say that a free return policy influences their online buying decisions, according to an NPR/Maris poll.
Still, most consumers don’t return online purchases very often. Only about 9% of consumers say they return online purchases often or very often. Those prolific returners could be abusing the system, but they could also be a retailer’s best customers. Some of the most desirable customers—younger, more affluent, and female shoppers—like to buy multiple sizes or styles of the same item and return all but one, according to a recent survey by Narvar, an online retail technology provider. In fact, Zappos found that their most profitable customers returned half of their orders.
So how do you create a return policy that’s just right—neither too generous or too restrictive? Read on for tips and comments from small business owners like you:
Do make your policy easy to understand.
“It’s important to keep your returns and refunds policies simple. Customers do not want to jump through hoops if something doesn’t work out for them,” says Vladimir Gendelman, the founder and CEO of Printwand, a custom printing and promotional item business.

Good to know: A good experience with a return builds customer loyalty: 95% of customers who were satisfied with a return said they would buy from that retailer again, according to Narvar.

Don’t give customers too much time to return items.
“As a small boutique that carries a limited number of garments in each size, when a customer brought back an item back 30 or 60 days later, the season was over and I would have to put it on the 50- to 75-percent-off rack. Plus, we missed a chance to sell it to someone else two or three times in that period,” says Richard Ignatz. His five Boutique Emmanuel stores in Michigan now offer a 10-day return period.

Good to know: Almost 75% of customers made their last online return within a week of purchase, according to Narvar, so even a fairly narrow return window should work for most customers.

Do leave some room for flexibility.
“Officially, our return policy is 30 days with the right to charge a restocking fee. In practice, we’ll take things back pretty much whenever as long as it is sellable and current. We are more restrictive on special orders as far as restocking fees if we have to send something back to a factory. But if it’s something we think we can easily sell, we’ll waive that fee. It is not worth the bad vibe with the customer to play games with the return policy, and it provides peace of mind with them if they don’t like their selection,” says Brad Schweig, vice president of operations at Sunnyland Patio Furniture in Dallas, Texas.

Good to know: Consumers hate restocking fees—84% say such a fee would prevent them from buying in the first place, according to Narvar.

Do consider what your return policy signals about your product.
“We know that whatever we sell will retain, if not grow, in value. [Our] return policy allows our customers the ability to upgrade if and when they are ready. They can trade it back for something more important, rarer, or more prominent,” says Bill Rau, the owner of M.S. Rau Antiques in New Orleans. His store accepts returns on jewelry with no restrictions, and even allows customers to exchange an item for a more expensive item, taking into account a 5% annual appreciation on the original purchase.

Good to know: A lifetime return policy can buy you a lot of good press, as it has for Patagonia, but be aware that some customers may take advantage. LL Bean recently restricted most returns to one year after purchase because about 15% of customers were abusing the policy.

Don’t be afraid to create a no-return policy if that’s what works for you.
Magnolia Emporium, a curated home decor, gift, art, and gourmet shop in Charlotte, North Carolina, says: “We actually solved that [problem of designing a good return policy] by not offering any returns. Printed right on our Clover receipts. [We] have tried many options over the last several decades and this is the only thing that works correctly.”

Good to know: Transparency is key when it comes to a return policy—according to Narvar, consumers say they’re happy with the Amazon returns process, even though it involves several steps, primarily because the process is transparent from beginning to end.

A generous return policy, particularly for online sales, can help attract customers. Many retailers have found that people who make returns are actually their most valuable customers in the long term. But you’ve got to keep an eye on your bottom line and design a policy that works for your products and your business.

news_456,news,Design for better business: Design your front-of-house customer experience,"It’s what inside that counts: give your front-of-house customer experience a refresh with these 5 tips to design for better business. From signage to scents, these upgrades might mean your customers never leave.…",20-02-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/design-for-better-business-design-your-front-of-house-customer-experience/,"Everyone knows it’s what’s inside that counts—but when it comes to your business, getting customers to come inside is half the battle. Designing your front-of-house customer experience, whether you’re a retailer, cafe, or beauty parlor, can make a huge difference in your foot traffic and bottom line. If this is the year to hone your in-store experience: you’ve come to the right place. Here are some ways small merchants can deliver a great visit to every customer who comes through the door.
Go on your customer journey.
We’re talking about your literal customer journey—the steps that a new customer takes to walk into your premises. Step in their shoes and try to look at your front-of-house objectively. Marketers have another version of the customer journey that you’re probably well familiar with. It’s the steps a potential customer takes to go from awareness, to consideration, to purchase.
The physical manifestation of the customer journey is equally important. What factors are keeping or preventing your consumers from becoming aware of your store, entering your front door, finding what they need, and making it to the register? Consider these things:

What is the signage outside?
What’s visible from the sidewalk?
What is visible from down the road?
What other smells and sounds engage a customer?
What do they see when they first walk in?

Match your online and offline branding.
Contrary to what you might assume, having an online presence does not mean that people won’t visit your brick-and-mortar location. Actually, one study found that three out of four shoppers who find helpful, local information online are more likely to visit stores.
At the very least, your online presence should be up to date with your store hours, address, and contact information. But, more importantly, don’t make a customer guess that they’ve arrived at the right place. Your signage is the first step toward reinforcing a consumer’s perception that your business is strong and reputable. Establish consistency with the same colors and fonts you use on your website. Make your brand unique and distinguished: make it yours by owning the color palette, imagery, and design across all your customer touchpoints.
Upgrade your signage.
Speaking of signage, is it time to refresh yours? One study discovered that upgrading a building’s sign, more than word-of-mouth marketing or social media, resulted in higher sales conversion. If you’re ready to redesign the look and feel of your front-of-house design, a new sign is a good place to start. Keep these tips in mind when designing your new signage:

For every distance of 10 feet, the height of the lettering should at least be one foot.
For outdoor signs, consider the speed of traffic going past your sign at 20, 40, and 50mph.
Experts (and science!) has found that about 80% of the brand recognition is done with color; so make sure to pick one or two colors to go on your signs.
Keep your font simple and easy to read.
Less is more! Keep your signs straightforward and clutter free.

Brush up on the other senses.
Sound and scent may not be two senses you’re thinking about, but they can be powerful tools in creating an engaging customer experience.
Picking the wrong playlist can have an adverse effect on your business: 44% of customers say they would leave a store if they didn’t like the music. What makes music “wrong” for your front-of-house? Partly, this insight comes from knowing your customers. But it also has to do a lot with knowing your own brand. A retail store selling custom shave kits will probably do better with an indie playlist, whereas a cafe where people go for work and coffee should stick to some soft rock or classical tunes. Music can also lead a customer to stay longer; buy faster; or buy more, depending on a number of psychological factors. Just be aware of the volume, and keep it fresh but mixing up your playlist every so often.
Scent design is a really interesting way to upgrade your customer experience. Humans can detect 1 trillion different smells; much like sound, scent can actually trigger a psychological effect where we are reminded of previous experiences. If you run a bakery, consider pointing your oven fans out toward the street to entice people in. Or, if you run a pet store, make sure the opposite is true; keep bad smells to a minimum as much as possible.
Consider your store layout.
Finally, think about how you’re using the space to make customers feel welcome. There’s a little psychology that comes into configuring your store layout, especially when it comes to retail. The first trick? Shoppers are naturally inclined to move clockwise while they shop. Stock your best-selling or most profitable items at eye-level. Make it easy for your customers to find what they need and navigate the space with signage, lighting, and wide enough aisles so no one feels overcrowded and stressed. It should be a pleasure to visit your store—not a chore.
Bottom line: each step of the way your store should draw the customer in, never drive them away. Have fun with it!

news_457,news,Business scenario: Cost has increased on key product or supplies,Rising supply costs can sneak up on your profit margins and eat away slowly at your operating budget. Avoid making these five mistakes when dealing with a cost increase on your key supplies or products. …,21-02-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-cost-has-increased-on-key-product-or-supplies/,"Many merchants pay close attention to the revenue part of the gross profit margin calculation. Driving sales, getting new customers, and adding new products are all important and tangible ways to show your business is growing. However, the second part of the calculating gross profit is the operating expenses side of the equation: and here’s where your costs can kneecap your business’s success.
Remember: gross profit is calculated by subtracting your business’s total expenditures from your total revenue to get your net income. Then divide your net income by your total revenue to determine your profit margin. Calculating your profit margin helps you see how much profit your business is generating at various revenue levels.
Savvy merchants know that cost increases on key supplies can threaten the health of your gross profit margin. Even just negotiating $0.15 less per shopping bag can impact your productivity. ising supply costs on a popular product can often lead to bigger issues down the line. Costs can continue to inch up bit by bit, shrinking profit margins to an unacceptably low point.
What do you do when costs start creeping up on you? Avoid making these easy mistakes to keep your profit margin healthy and your business booming.
Mistake 1: Assuming higher costs mean higher demand.
Does it seem like you’re constantly shelling out cash for supplies like shopping bags, receipt paper, plastic cutlery, or other basic business necessities? If you’re in the weeds of your day to day operations, it can appear that these high costs are going straight into meeting high demand. Don’t make that assumption without checking the bigger picture. Double check to make sure unnecessary business shrinkage going on. Inventory waste can be a silent killer of budgets.
Mistake 2: Not entertaining bids from new vendors.
Actively managing your vendor agreements might be a thing you only do once a year or once every few years. However, keeping informed about your suppliers – and their competitors – can help you manage cost creep. One survey showed that it’s common practice for small businesses to renegotiate long-term contracts. Obviously, it’s important to go about negotiating your supplier contracts ethically and transparently. Here are some ways you can reduce costs when soliciting bids from a new vendor:

Get the specifics on each product or supply, including the size and the state it is in when it’s delivered.
Cut down on the frequency of your deliveries to reduce overhead
Buy in bulk as much as possible
Have specific quality standards that you can communicate during the bid process

Loyalty is nice, especially as a small business owner. But if your vendor prices have only been increasing over the years, it could be time to find someone new.
Mistake 3: Becoming super-dependent on one product.
A common mistake many merchants make is becoming something of a one-trick pony. A product or service may sell out each and every week; it’s easy to become reliant on that one thing to make your revenue goals each month.
However, leaning too heavily on one product to drive your profit margin opens up a big risk. This approach commodifies your business and could open you up to being undercut by Amazon or another corporate giant. If your customers can find your product or service for cheaper, they may abandon your cart. Instead, consider a profitable approach that harnesses your customer relationships, your expertise in your vertical, and insight into your customers’ preferences.
Mistake 4: Not recognizing trends in your customers’ tastes.
On that note, this is perhaps one of the most common mistakes of all. As a small business owner, you have the opportunity for a much closer relationship with your customers than a big retailer or corporate entity. Take advantage of this connection to think strategically about what your customers like to find products they will also love. This can diversify your product mix over time, lowering your risk if supply costs for one product rise.
It also presents an opportunity for you to upsell, cross-sell, or bundle products. Increasing the amount you sell to your customer at one time means you will increase purchase velocity, an important KPI that indicates you are lowering your cost per sale in terms of overhead. How can you increase your average ticket amount per customer? Can you offer larger units of purchase? Can you cross-sell complimentary products or services?
Mistake 5: Never raising your prices.
Many merchants are loathe to raise their prices, with high-profile controversies like the Netflix price hike providing plenty of discouragement. However, sometimes raising the price tag is just necessary. Costs will rise as a natural part of economic upturns and downturns: otherwise, movie tickets would still be 46 cents and soda would cost 5 cents.
If you do decide it’s time to raise your prices, make sure to implement some kind of communication plan so your customers aren’t caught by surprise. Give customers plenty of warning, prepare your employees to answer questions about the price hike, and be clear about how much you actually need to raise prices to cover your costs.
Overall, keeping costs down requires a little three-dimensional chess. Think about your product mix and diversity, costs versus profit, customers buying habits, and how all these elements interrelate to impact your bottom line.

…",23-02-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/cultivate-a-stellar-restaurant-staff-with-these-hiring-and-management-tips/,"Record unemployment is making it hard to find reliable, talented people. In fact, industry data collected in 2018 found that three-quarters of restaurants experienced more difficulty recruiting hourly employees than in years past.
That’s a serious challenge, especially as competition in the sector remains stiff. Landing great people can be the secret weapon that restaurants need to stand out.
To learn about best practices for hiring and managing employees, see Clover’s quick guide for getting people on board and keeping them motivated. For extra tips and tools on cultivating a stellar restaurant staff, read on.
Build a stellar reputation.
In a tight labor market, employees have choices. Candidates will evaluate you before you evaluate them. They’ll turn to customer reviews on Yelp and employee comments on Glassdoor, which can tell a one-sided and unflattering story.
Stay on top of your online presence and resolve any ongoing problems that reviewers might note. For specific customer complaints and concerns, follow up online in a professional manner.
You can even prompt people to add their own reviews simply by creating a solid Yelp profile. Remember: the better your online reputation, the stronger the applicant pool will be.

Hire people with the right attitude.
Not everyone will come with years of experience. Of course, you want your chef to have a great track record, but your next host might come with no formal work experience at all. Look beyond the traditional resume to search for indicators that the candidate is reliable, ready to learn, and pleasant to work with.
Volunteer experience, a referral from a current employee, or a can-do outlook can be enough to take a chance. To save time in the hiring process, consider using pre-written job descriptions. Here are sample write-ups for hosts, servers, prep cooks, chefs, dishwashers, and other essential players in the operation.
Offer a competitive package.
State laws vary significantly when it comes to minimum wages for tipped and regular employees, but establishments that go beyond the baseline gain an edge.
What are your competitors paying their people? Consider matching or exceeding their rates. Think beyond base pay to include paid time off, bonuses, 401(k) plans, tuition assistance, gym memberships—any kind of motivating tool for getting and keeping employees.
If finances are lean, consider low-cost perks like transportation passes or spa vouchers. Long-term strategies include offering pathways to advancement and giving people the flexible schedules they need to balance their lives.
Feed your people well.
For the ultimate perk, consider adding or improving upon a time-honored tradition in the restaurant world: sharing a meal together. In the lull of the early evening, the crew comes together to enjoy a tasty meal and fuel up for the evening rush.
While catered food often replaces staff meals prepared by chefs and cooks, some restaurants still enjoy providing employees with the same great dining experience that customers receive.
The Michelin Guide website profiles two establishments in Singapore that have perfected the staff meal—reducing wastage and forging bonds in the process.

Turn servers into connoisseurs.
Managing employees isn’t about controlling them. It’s more about empowering them. At restaurants, that means helping customer-facing employees become product experts.
Customers depend on servers for suggestions and tips. An employee who can respond knowledgeably and authentically is an asset. By organizing regular tastings of menu items, employees can gain that knowledge.
Explain where ingredients are sourced, how the chef prepares the dish, and what to suggest for customers who are vegan, gluten-free, lactose-intolerant, or have other special requests. Be particularly vigilant to coach staff on menu items that include nuts, shellfish, and other foods that can trigger allergic reactions.
Teach them to subtly sell more.
Knowledgeable employees don’t just know the menu inside out. They also have a repertoire of scripts and sales techniques to help customers make good decisions and order more.
One tactic is encouraging customers to upgrade their purchases or buy additional items. Be careful, though. Unless it’s done subtly and with the customers’ best interests in mind, this tactic can backfire.
Effective upselling techniques focus on alerting people to special offers and offering personal (not canned) suggestions. You can even bring upselling to call-in orders or checkout. A little training and practice help employees serve customers better—and sell more.
Break down barriers between the front- and back-of house.
In busy restaurants, getting orders filled quickly and accurately is critical. But many common situations—special requests, incorrect items entered into the POS, or large parties strolling through the door—can break down the process.
Restaurants need communication systems that link the kitchen with the servers. This free webinar offers tips on improving communications, including listing ingredients on your POS, clearly posting availability of items on the POS, cross-training staff, and empowering servers to resolve customer problems.
Use technology to simplify employees’ jobs.
POS technology can help in others ways as well. For scheduling staff, software such as Time Clock by Homebase, which is pre-loaded on the Clover POS, provides a simple way to build schedules and share them with the team. Other apps streamline payroll, table management and bar tabs, waitlists, and more.

After all, even after a bumpy year, Facebook still finished 2018 with 1.49 billion daily users. Instagram is nothing to sneeze at either—they have more than a billion users too, and review sites like Yelp! and Trip Advisor are an integral part of your customer’s decision to try your store. Social media is a crucial component of any business marketing plan. Once you build up a following of fans and evangelists, you can quickly spread news about your sales, promotions, events, and more. Here are a few savvy strategies to leverage your social media profile in 2019.
Photos top illustrations and words.
You want to sell more? Get past people’s logic and appeal directly to their senses. Let’s say you run a Thai food truck. People may initially find you by searching for “Thai food near me” on their favorite social media site…but after that they are going to look for something that stands out. Does your profile blend in with the hundreds of other menus listing pad thai? Or do you have brightly colored close ups of that mouth-watering green curry with vegetables including a swirl of white coconut milk and a red pepper and cilantro garnish on top? Eye-grabbing photos are a wonderful way to convince customers that you’re worth visiting. Are you the local watering hole? Show pictures of close friends in an intimate, inviting space, or a shot of your top-shelf liquor in super-cool lighting.
If you’re selling food, your photos should make them drool. If you’re selling a salon experience, it should make them long for a massage or daydream about your Zen-like rooms with elegant waterfall features. Appeal to their deepest desires.
This starts with jaw-dropping imagery. Luckily, with just your mobile phone you can take great shots of your products, location, and even team members to make your profile stand out. Set up the best lighting for effect, use filters on your phone, zoom in close and take a variety of shots in contrasting colors. Consider taking a few that are off-center, or that add the visual interest of something in the foreground against something in the background.
Get them to want it now.
Your ad was successful. It caught their eye, they nodded in approval, and then they clicked away. Wait, that’s not what you want them to do….you want them to click on the add and buy something now. What really gets customers to make that commitment? A sense of urgency.
Here are just a few ways to create that:

Use language like “for a limited time only,” “today,” or “now.”
Make them worry about missing out on the deal with words like “just a few left,” “limited edition,” or “exclusive deal.”
Show a countdown clock.
Emphasize negative consequences of not acting. “You may never see this offer again.”
Bring out their competitive side with games or contests.

Be recognizable.
Most of your customers are bombarded daily with emails, pop ups, robo-calls, and other forms of advertising. How do they function? They use mental shortcuts to find what might interest them…and ignore the rest. So how do you help them make sure they don’t miss out on your latest deal? You help your marketing stand out by being consistent in the colors, fonts, design and messaging styles. In other words…you develop a brand and stick to it.
Know your ideal customer.
The most common mistake new advertisers make is to try to appeal to everyone. If you’re looking to get more bang for your advertising buck, make sure you know who your ideal customer is right down to the times they’re most likely to be on your social media site. You probably have more than one “ideal customer” and a great shortcut for making sure your ads appeal to them is to create a “buyer persona.” This is just a snapshot of who that buyer is. Is it a stay-at-home mom with three young kids, or a young, childless power couple? Not only do different “personas” shop differently, the types of ads that will appeal to them are radically different.
Ask and ye shall receive.
Let’s say your ads are really eye-catching and resonate with your customers…those are only the first two steps. They also need to drive your customers to the action you want them to take, and that should relate back to your business goals. Do you want them to go right to buying a product? Are you hoping they will sign up for an event? Are you looking for more likes and shares? Are you building up an email list? This is your chance to guide the customer to the right decision with a great call to action.
Calls to action also help orient your customers. At a glance, they know exactly what the ad is about and what will happen if they click on a button or link. This helps get them in the right frame of mind, so that when they do click on that link they already know what action they are likely to take once they are there.
Check your metrics.
How do you know if a promotion is worth repeating? Measure results and compare it to your other campaigns using Clover Insights. It’ll help you track how well you’re doing reaching your goals and also hone your campaigns. (After all, once you know that photos of coffee sell better than cookies, you’ll know what to put as your main image.)

Then he started and found himself immediately mired in minutiae. How he started down the road to strategically growing the businesses. …,25-02-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/restaurant-business-planning-how-to-set-smart-goals/,"by Andaiye Taylor

Better Business in Brief:   
– Restaurant general manager Matthew Ling had big ideas for how he would grow business for three restaurants he was running, but often found himself mired in the day-to-day grind of restaurant management.
– Matt decided to be deliberate, start small, and demonstrate wins from specific strategic goals in order to move the needle for the business.
– His first step was to define thoughtful, relevant, and achievable goals for the restaurant. He achieved this by aligning with ownership; talking to customers, staff, and fellow management; observing restaurant operations analytically; and reading reviews.

How one innovative restaurant manager makes time to transcend distractions and move his business forward. 
When Matthew Ling, whose work with creative promotions using Clover POS we previously profiled, agreed to run three full-service restaurants earlier this year, he approached the job with big ideas for how he might level up all three businesses.
Matt had already managed high-volume bars and restaurants, but with three locations to run, each with distinct concepts, and all three just steps from a Top 10 U.S. sports and entertainment arena, he saw a rich opportunity to enact some of the employee training, customer growth and menu optimization ideas he had been harboring. “I was pumped,” Matt said. “With three restaurants instead of one, there were a lot of potential ways to add value.”
But Matt found himself mired in minutiae almost from the beginning. “You start your day with one big goal in mind, then you hit the door and are instantly pulled in ten directions. Your staff needs you. There are customers to check on. Something breaks. And of course, all of those things need addressing,” he said. “But so does the work that builds business. And it can be frustrating to figure out how to do it all.”
A few months into the job, Matt realized that in order to carve out time to do the type of work that would drive the business forward, he would need to be deliberate, start small, and demonstrate wins from strategic work in order to gain the confidence of ownership. His biggest revelation: he needed to establish just the right goals to make sure that his work on and off the floor added up to something greater. “I think a lot about this industry, so I had some ideas for things we could do when I started,” he said. “Those actually shifted a lot once I got into the restaurant and started managing in the weeds.” Matt walked us through exactly how he went about defining the right set of goals for growing all three restaurant businesses.
1. He got feedback from the restaurant owner
As Matt stated it to us: “Their goals are your goals.” Make sure you understand from ownership what their priorities are. Assumptions can hurt, even when they’re made with the best intentions. That’s because not all growth is created equally in the minds of restaurant owners. Not only is it their prerogative as the owner to set the objectives, but there’s a great likelihood they have insight into the business landscape and their future plans that you’re not privy to.
“Don’t kill yourself getting more bodies in the door for happy hour when they want you to focus on growing corporate relationships for lunch catering,” Matt advised. While more happy hour customers might be a nice-to-have, you’ll want to put your strategic energy into figuring out the marketing, staffing and processes required to grow lunch catering relationships and revenue if that’s what the owner wants.
But what if the owner doesn’t have any strategic goals to speak of? “If you get something general like ‘grow revenue,’ now is your opportunity to put some ideas in front of them,” Matt said. Priorities could include adding more party bookings, growing unique customer volume, increasing repeat visitors or ramping up spend per visit. If the owner is still noncommittal, then offer your suggestion and make sure they affirm you will be working on that objective over the next months and quarters.
2. He worked with his back-of-house counterpart.
The restaurant group Matt works for established a separate back-of-house manager. Matt knew that he would need to get on the same page as his back-of-house counterpart in order to succeed. The first reason was because both sides of the house need to be tightly synched to deliver great performance. The other reason: “There can be so many great ideas that stay locked up in the kitchen,” Matt told us. Consistent communication with back-of-house leadership and employees is essential to extract those insights and make sure they’re represented in your overall goals.
Matt said he already communicated regularly with the back-of-house manager during the normal course of operations at his restaurants, but thought it was important to establish a separate conversation to discuss the future of the restaurant, the owners’ objectives, and the back-of-house manager’s sense of missed opportunities. The pair had a dinner meeting off premises to chat about ideas. “He told me a small buffet station at lunch could be a great ‘express’ option and a way to test new menu ideas,” Matt said. “I knew from my conversation with ownership that it could also be a way to grow lunch volume in our location at the same time we grew our catering business. It was a great idea that checked a lot of boxes” and that was uniquely in the back-of-house manager’s field of vision for potential opportunities.

3. He gathered feedback from his employees.
Matt knows his employees are on the front lines of restaurant operations. “If a customer is muttering under their breath about something they don’t like, if they’re raving about how our pizza is better than what they had in Italy–the servers hear it all,” he said. Matt checks in regularly with counter workers, bartenders, and servers to learn how customers are reacting. An additional benefit of this, he said, is that it helps these employees understand they aren’t merely a vector for food and drinks. “I’m telling them they’re important advisors to me” on how to run the business better. Asking the question also makes his staff better listeners and problem solvers, said Matt, because they connect each customer interaction to the overall well being of the business that employs them.
Talking to employees is also critical for figuring out objectives around process. “When something is broken, they feel it first,” either through direct experience or by bearing the brunt of complaints from customers if something goes awry.

4. He walked the floor with focus.
Turns out that diving into the weeds of operations pays off after all. Matt told us that as he began to work on business objectives for the restaurants, he reframed the time he spent resolving staff issues, greeting customers, backfilling staff, hauling merchandize, approving discounts, and managing complaints as more than important “must do” tasks unto themselves. “I love data, and all this stuff is data,” he said. Now he approaches this work as an important method for ingesting information about how to improve operations at the restaurant, and to understand risks and opportunities that could become goals.

5. He pulled reports.
Matt told us he thought it was important to let his Clover reports do the talking. “Those reports tell an important story,” he said. But the key to working with restaurant reporting is to imagine you’re interviewing the data. “If you don’t know what you want to learn from the data, you will get lost,” he said. Matt advises creating a checklist of daily data points you’ll want to check–overall revenue and visits, for example–and that you understand what questions you are looking to answer before doing a deeper dive.
Once exception: explore your reporting system to see what types of data is available, which can help you define questions you may not have thought to ask. Matt told us he spent time digging into Clover reports to see what data and filters were available.

6. He held his breath and read the reviews.
For candid insights into the best and worst of restaurant operations, Matt also turned to their Yelp reviews. “I had to hold my breath” when taking a deep dive into reviews the first time, he said, but he realized almost immediately that they were a treasure trove. Good reviews were useful as positive validation of what was going well. As for the bad reviews? “One thing I think about all the time is that if it wasn’t for Yelp, customers would have a bad experience, leave, never come back, and we’d never know why.” He sees reviews as a way to understand issues that might go unnoticed and unprioritized–and a channel to reach out to dissatisfied customers and invite them back in once issues have been resolved.

Matt said that he received great guidance from ownership on where they wanted him to move the needle. He translated these into goals to make sure he could create a plan to achieve them, measure his progress, understand their impact on the business, and report those results back up to ownership.
Set a strategic goal for your restaurant
 Talk to executive management or ownership about their goals for your restaurant. If you are the owner, take some time to define them.
 Set a time period when you will ingest feedback from other sources to inform your goals. Matt decided he would do this work over the course of one week.
 Now get feedback: talk to your management counterparts, employees and customers. Be mindful when walking the floor. Read reviews. Define questions you need answered about the business and pull reports to answer them. Use all these inputs to refine your larger goals and set secondary ones.
 After getting the insight, Matt took an additional few days to process the information, develop goals and validate them once more with ownership.
 Remember, good goals are SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable (and agreed upon), realistic, and time-based. If your goals are general at first (“Increase lunchtime catering business”) clarify or suggest a SMART goal you can work towards (“Increase lunchtime catering contracts among offices in a five-block radius from two to seven within the next six months.”)

news_462,news,Business accelerators: Harnessing & measuring word-of-mouth marketing,A whopping 92% of customers ask for recommendations from people they know before they buy. Here are 3 types of campaigns to help get the word-of-mouth going as well as advice on how to track the effectiveness of your promotions.…,26-02-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-harnessing-measuring-word-of-mouth-marketing/,"Who do customers look to for advice on what to buy and where? Believe it or not, the bulk of them ask their friends and family. A whopping 92% of customers ask for recommendations from people they know before they buy. That makes word-of-mouth marketing one of the most effective strategies you can use to bring in new customers. Here are 3 types of campaigns to help get the word-of-mouth going as well as advice on how to track the effectiveness of your promotions.
Referral Bonuses
When you spend your time coming up with marketing campaigns, you don’t just want a little bang for your buck, you want a BOOM. Customers who are referred to you are four times more likely to buy. Even better, according to Wharton School of Business, they are 18% more likely to stay with you over time making their lifetime value 16% higher than customers who weren’t referred to you. Want to encourage your best customers to mention you to their friends? Create a refer-a-friend program. Using a customer referral reward app such as BuyFi make it easy. You simply collect your customer’s email address at the end of a purchase and the program will email the offer out for you. The customer refers you to friends, and if the friends buy, they all get rewards.
Rewards should reflect the value a new customer is to your business. For example, banks will often offer $50 for every friend you refer who keeps their money in the bank for more than 6 months. That’s because the profit the bank makes on that referral is significantly higher than $50. So consider how much value a referral really is to you when you determine the “reward” for your loyal customer.
Here are a few quick ideas:

Refer a friend for a complimentary coffee and get a free croissant with your next order.
Refer a friend and get more. For every friend who gives us a try you’ll get a free polish.
Bring a friend for your next mani-pedi and you’ll both get a 10 minute shoulder massage.
Psst. Bring a friend and you both get $5 off if you sign up for our rewards program.
Refer a friend and you both get 20% off your next order. Limitations apply.

Try a few campaigns to see what really resonates with your best customers—they are the ones most likely to give a good referral to a friend.
Once your campaign is live, measure your return on investment by dividing your total profits by your total costs and multiplying by 100.
So, for example, let’s say you ran the $5 off campaign and earned $1,500 in your promotion period. Add up how many people redeemed your $5 off. (This isn’t the same number as those who received the offer—you only “lost” $5 if they redeemed it.) If 30 people redeemed your $5 off coupon, your cost for the campaign was $150. In this example, the Return on Investment (ROI) is $1,500 divided by 150 and multiplied by 100, or 1000%. That’s a pretty good return, especially when you consider those new customers are also likely to return and spend more money.
Want to know how valuable these customers are over time? Make sure you tag any new customers who came through a referral. Then you can run reports later on how much money they spent with you from year to year.
Loyalty Reward Programs
Whether you want to offer loyal customers a point system or a punch system, loyalty rewards are so effective they’re everywhere. They’re so prevalent, in fact, that many customers expect them. Many customers will go shopping with friends just to rack up extra points, which is what you want…new customers in the door who will in turn become loyal.
Which loyalty program is right for you? Let’s take a look at the two most common types:

Point systems keep track of specific actions and gives customers points they can then exchange for products or services. You could, for example, offer 10 points if they sign up for your email, or 20 points if they follow you on social media. Reward them based on the amount they spend in the store, or if they make another purchase within a specific time period. Point systems can work well for businesses just starting out as it encourages repeat business right away.To make sure you earn back whatever you’re offering in this type of system, limit how many points they can earn for intangible things like following you on social media or liking your latest posts. Then make sure the customer spends enough with you to reach your breakeven point and be profitable even with the discount. While these are slightly more complicated to set up, they are often more profitable than punch systems.
Punch systems are when the customer gets rewarded for the number of times they buy a specific product or service. “Get 10 oil changes and your 11th is free” is an example of a punch system and is a little simpler for the customer to track and understand. Customers can also be very determined to get that last punch, which is good for you.

To run a program like this, figure out your breakeven point for 11 of the item you’re rewarding and make sure you’re still making a profit. If there is a $10 lunch special that costs $5 to make, 11 lunch specials would cost $55 and would cost the customer $100. You can make the offer and still make a decent profit.
Both of these loyalty reward types are simple to set up with your Clover system. Simply determine your offer and use Clover Rewards to set it up. You can even send out automatic emails to customers to remind them how close they are to their reward. Clover rewards will also help you track how many people take advantage of these offers so you can track your ROI easier.
How Much Is Your Social Media Following Worth?
Everyone likes to be liked. But how much is that “like” or new follower really worth for you? How much did that Yelp review boost your profits?
Here are 5 ways to quantify your social media and review sites:

Make an offer only through social media and see how many people cash it in.
Make an announcement only through social media and measure the response. If, for example, you post on social media, “Ask about our friends and family program this week and get a surprise bonus,” you can measure how many people actually ask about the program. This can be a great way to make customers feel like they’re in-the-know about special offers. It’ll also give you a measure of how responsive your following is.
Track whether engagement in your posts leads to foot traffic or a desired behavior. Maybe you post a stunning shot of your jalapeño poppers happy hour appetizer and get 100 views or shares. Do you then get a boost in people ordering that later in the week? If you spent all week posting about the new flavor of coffee you’re offering—did you get a boost in the number of people trying it?
Track views and foot traffic. Every week tally up how many people looked at your posts or reviews. Was there a surge in traffic to your store that matches up in the same time period?
Use special phone numbers or links that track activity. Don’t just put your main phone number on these sites. Set up call tracking so you know how many people call you after reading your social media posts. If you put special tracking links on every link in your feed, you’ll also be able to see whether they result in business.

If you’re not getting the kind of response you expected from your social media, it’s time to find out why. Try Clover Feedback to get first-hand feedback from your customers.

One of the top reasons is due to cash management problems: 29 percent of failed businesses simply run out of cash.
Why do so many small businesses struggle with cash management? It starts with not understanding cash flow–the rhythm of money flowing into and out of a business. Simply put, you want more coming in than going out. The challenge for many businesses is they don’t have insight into what their cash position looks like at any given time. That’s where trouble begins.
Think of a grocer whose customers pay with cash. Maybe the cashier gives the wrong change, money goes missing from the till, or money doesn’t even make it into the till. Consider a restaurant. Daily sales are taxed pennies on the dollar. Doesn’t sound bad, right? What if nobody’s setting those pennies aside? At month’s end, the restaurant owner struggles to cobble cash together–maybe thousands of dollars–for the tax payment.
Consider these tips and tools to better understand your cash flow, which will make it easier for you to successfully manage it.
Know the flow

Really understanding the flow of money in and money out,” Joseph told us. “They’re very good at getting money in, and Clover helps them do this…but the outflow of cash, which is where they have to manage that money, most business owners really lack this skill.”
To help small businesses track cash, Clover recommends two apps: Cash Log and Cash Track. Cash Log, a free Clover app, is especially helpful in retail where cash regularly changes hands. This app tracks all customer cash transactions and manager cash drawer activities to spotlight where cash is moving. Cash Track tracks cash movement from employees or registers. To use it, record the cash you assign to each register and employee at the beginning of each shift. At shift’s end, reconcile the employee’s count with the manager’s count and the shift report. Cash Track also sends daily shift reports by email or to your Clover dashboard. It even helps restaurants calculate tips.
Stay on top of sales tax daily
During his restaurant days, David Joseph was once surprised by a $9,000 sales tax bill from his bookkeeper, prompting him to ask, “Why can’t someone do our sales tax the way ADP does our payroll?” He eventually answered his own question by  conceived a tool he says is meant to help restaurant owners sleep at night: DAVO Sales Tax.
In Joseph’s words: “It’s automated. The Clover [app] calculates sales tax. It sends us the sales data. All of that is done automatically, and what we really do is cash management…we put a little bit of money aside [for sales tax payments] every day.”
DAVO automatically collects daily sales tax, hold the money securely, files it, and pays it in full and on time. For DAVO users, that means no more worries about surprise sales tax bills or late penalties.
Free the business from cash mismanagement–or even theft
Businesses often lose track of cash through fraud. That’s where another great app, Ping Me If, can help. Focused on fraud deterrence, Ping Me If provides email or text notifications when specific events happen in your business, like a payment, refund, a tip or discount that exceeds an amount you specify, deleted orders, opening the cash drawer without a transaction, and the removal of cash from the drawer.
Eject handling errors
For clever ways to reduce cash handling overall, check out CoinOut and Donate at Checkout.
CoinOut is a digital change handler. Customers receive and save their change from a transaction digitally and can get cash back to spend with your business. Or they can simply take a picture of their receipt to earn cash back. Available in the Clover App Market, CoinOut offers a 0% processing fee.
Donate at Checkout lets you collect donations at transaction’s end from customers for your charity of choice. With preset amounts for donations and a ‘Round Up’ feature, you can access reports on donations received from its online portal.
Fund your emergencies and seasonal changes
Failing to plan for the unexpected stymies cash flow. Fortunately, DAVO creator David Joseph and team figured out two simple solutions: Savings Club and Sweep and Save.
“How many times do restaurants say, ‘Oh, the air conditioner broke. The refrigerator broke,’ you know?” Joseph asked. “If you put aside $20 a day, at the end of the year, you’re gonna have somewhere around $7,000.”
An annual savings tool, Savings Club automatically sets funds aside daily and returns them to you mid-December for year-end needs. Sweep and Save puts aside a percentage of daily sales for monthly expenses and sends it back to you on the first of the next month.
“If your rent is $600 a month and you’re open every day, you can put aside $20 a day and have $600 in your account on the first of the month,” said Joseph. “You don’t have to think about it. You don’t have to budget for it. It’s done for you.” With these tools and other Clover apps, cash management is a business risk you can sweep off the table.

You many think you’re being financially responsible if you’ve been wary of taking on debt, but you could actually be holding your business back. Here are 5 signs your business may need financing:

Your cash reserves are running thin.While every business is different, having at least 90 days’ worth of cash in the bank is usually recommended. If you can’t last three months based on what you currently have in the bank, you might want to seek financing.
You’re putting a lot on credit cards. Just like with your personal credit cards, if your business is using too much of its total available credit, it could hurt your credit score–and your chances of getting a more significant loan if and when you need one. Better to plan ahead and get right financing for your current business situation.
Your tools, tech, or space can’t keep up with demand. If your ancient point-of-sale system is inflexible or slowing you down, your small ovens mean you struggle to turn out enough cupcakes to meet the post-lunch rush, or your coffee shop is bursting at the seams every morning, it might be time for an upgrade. This is exactly the kind of expense that loans were made for–they can pay off handsomely in the form of higher output and an ability to acquire and serve more customers.
Competition is getting fierce. You don’t want to overreact when dealing with new, or newly successful, competition, but you will want to take action. Possible responses might include expanding your product line, staying open longer, or hiring more staff to ensure swift service. Any of those actions might require you to seek financing.
You need more capacity. Maybe you just got a really big order, and you need to hire some temporary staff to meet the deadline. Or maybe you’re noticing that you’re selling out of bagels every day, and it’s time to hire another baker to keep up with demand. Adding more capacity is a great reason to take on financing.

If you’ve decided it’s time to take out a loan or another type of financing, you’ve got plenty of options. A traditional bank loan is likely to be the cheapest source of extra cash, but it can also take a while to get that cash into your account.
Marketplace lenders with online applications can get you cash within a couple of days, but you may end up paying through the nose for that convenience. If you’re a Clover customer, Clover Capital is another possible option. This program can advance you some cash based on your average credit card sales. Repayment is easy, and also based on sales, so you won’t get stuck with payments you can’t afford.
Seeking financing can be a great sign that your business is strong and ready to grow. Just like with your personal credit card, using financing responsibly can improve your business’s credit score and help you achieve your goals. Whatever your reason for seeking financing, be thoughtful about the financing type, amount, and timing–and rest assured that there are plenty of options available that will meet your particular needs.

news_466,news,Crowd pleasers: Making birthday rewards work for your business,Everyone has a birthday—and just about every business has a birthday rewards program to bring people in the door. Discover 5 ways to make your birthday reward program stand out in a crowded landscape and become a value driver for your business.…,06-03-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-making-birthday-rewards-work-for-your-business/,"Birthdays are a funny thing. Looking at them objectively, they shouldn’t be a big deal—literally everyone has a birthday. But honestly, very few people look at their birthdays from an objective standpoint—it’s their special day, and they want to do things that make them feel special. Oftentimes, that means going out and celebrating with friends and family or treating themselves to something they enjoy during the day…which leaves the perfect opening for businesses to offer a birthday rewards program.
Regular communication and engagement with rewards program customers is key to making these programs work. Starbucks gets this; that’s why their Customer Loyalty and Birthday Club programs are the gold standard for U.S. retailers. But one problem facing small businesses is that there is a lot of competition for birthday rewards. In fact, an Alliance Data study found that more than half of the consumers surveyed feel special when a retailer acknowledges their birthday, which is why the average consumer receives between five and nine birthday reward offers. The bad news for businesses is that consumers on average only redeem between one and four of those offers.
So how can you make your business stand out in the crowded birthday rewards space? Here are five ways to make a birthday reward program that will work for your business.
1. Give it away, now.
When it comes to bringing people in the door, you want to remove as many barriers to entry as possible. It’s a simple fact that more people will jump at a free birthday reward rather than a coupon that requires them to make a purchase to receive the reward. A personalized offer sent at the right time for free coffee, free snacks, or a small free gift—given away with no strings attached—can be big incentives for customers who have competing birthday rewards offers. But don’t “discount” birthday coupons altogether, because…
2. Discounts can bring big business, too.
Medieval Times, America’s top dinner attraction, knows that birthdays are big business. The all-ages show provides a great experience to kids and adults alike, and their rewards program makes it tempting to have a birthday party at the castle. A typical birthday reward includes free admission for the birthday boy or girl—as long as it’s accompanied by the purchase of a full priced adult admission. Wouldn’t you enjoy getting an email for free admission on your birthday and leave it up to someone else, or better yet, a group of people, to pick up the tab?
3. Everyone loves a gift card.
While most businesses have specific birthday rewards like a free coffee or discount on a purchase, there is one way to think outside the box and give customers a differentiated experience: give them a free gift card to your business. The gift card doesn’t have to be for a huge amount of money, but you’ll hit on a number of benefits by giving them out. First, the customer is getting something real and tangible – a true birthday gift. You’re also putting the customer in control by letting them decide what they want to get with the birthday reward. If you offer the right amount, it becomes a teaser to spend more money in your store. For example, if you offer a $10 gift card, but your products are primarily in the $20 range, you’ve just enticed them to spend $10 in your store. And lastly, if you give them a refillable card, you increase the changes that they’ll continue shopping with you.
4. Don’t break the bank.
There’s no getting around it—it costs some money to offer any promotion. The key is turning the reward into a loss leader so you can get customers in the door for repeat business. But that doesn’t mean you have to break the bank with every birthday reward your business gives out. There are a couple of options here: you can either give away something small that does not cost you much like a cup of coffee, or you can provide something free that just begs for an accompanying item. For example, what are the odds that someone will eat their free birthday cookie without a nice (not free) beverage to wash it down?
5. Get a goody bag at the end.
Remember when you were a kid and you’d get a goody bag at the end of a birthday party? Well, the same holds true for your business and its birthday rewards program. You should get something in return for the reward you’re providing, i.e., you can’t just give out a reward to anyone who says it is their birthday. Instead, encourage customers to sign up for your rewards program by filling out a form that includes their name, email address, and birthday. This information will help cut down on fraudulent birthday claims and will also allow you to reach out to these customers with other rewards, promotions, and coupons.
Ready to start making a reward program work for your business? Keep your customers coming back when you download this free, customizable rewards app or get additional functionality like birthday rewards when you subscribe to the Customer Engagement Plus program.

news_467,news,How Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) can remix menu flavors to maximize fun & profit,"Atlanta-based Sublime Doughnuts depends on a fun remix of doughnut flavors, a keen sense of customer, and accurate inventory tracking. How can quick serve restaurants get the info they need to make smarter product decisions? With the right analytics tool and these 4 tips.…",07-03-2019,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/how-quick-service-restaurants-qsr-can-remix-menu-flavors-to-maximize-fun-profit/,"“When you eat a doughnut, you really want to be happy,” says founder and ownerpreneur of Sublime Doughnuts Kamal Grant. And that’s what Sublime does every day in Atlanta: serve up doughy happiness with creamy fillings and sweet toppings.
Thanks to Kamal’s creative vision and travels, Sublime “present[s] flavors and textures from around the world on a doughnut canvas.”

The Sublime brand depends on a fun, continuous remix of doughnut flavors—a mix helped along by a keen sense of customer and accurate inventory tracking. And it’s a brand that offers four sweet lessons for quick service restaurants (QSRs).
1. Know Your Customer
You’ve heard the retail maxim “The customer’s always right.” Whether every customer is right 100% of the time or not, one thing’s for sure—the more you connect with your customers, the better you can serve them. The better you serve them, the more repeat business you’re likely to have. And that’s especially true for QSRs. Those small, repeat transactions add up to a major payback over a year. Check out The Parable of the $5.35 Guy as an example.
For Sublime, a big part of knowing customers is understanding that they like to see what they’re ordering as they order it.
“We have two [Clover] Stations and two customer facing Minis. And that’s really good for us because [customers] can see the doughnuts as we put them in,” Kamal explains.
Among its many features, Clover Mini lets customers view their orders as they place them and helps QSRs reduce inventory waste from order mixups.
2. Track Inventory
What does Kamal consider one of toughest parts of running a doughnut shop? “How much to make.”
Many QSRs struggle to figure out how much inventory to keep on-hand, how much product to make, and when to make it.
Kamal stays on top of his inventory and bottom line with Clover Insights. A tracking and inventory app, Insights helps him “get the history and data on which doughnuts sold” to which VIP customers and when. What’s more, Insights is the only tool that offers a view into the competition, how much they’re making, and how many clients they’re serving. It also compares a QSR’s performance against the industry with actionable information, forecasts, and data—data most QSRs don’t have the time or resources to gather. Even better, the Service Plan is free, and Insights Standard is a mere $9.99 a month.
For even more analytics information, take a look these apps:

Analytics by Qualia tracks order and payment details, stock values, date and hour trends, payments per employee, customers, tender, categories, items and more, all while generating multi-dimensional analyses. Access this browser-based app on any device, at any time.
TruAnalysis provides real-time data about top customers, top-selling products, stock, and more. And it links directly to your POS hardware.
Dashboard Business Analytics by Infuse offers metrics to manage your QSR from anywhere on any device with its simple real-time sales reports, insights, and performance analytics. The cost? Only $4.95 per month.

Designed specifically for restaurants, these apps help manage perishables:

MarketMan is a cloud-based inventory management and purchasing tool that streamlines procurement, delivery, and accounting for all kinds of food and beverage businesses.
Recipe Keeper tracks on-hand stock for various dishes or recipes. Download the app and map your recipes to ingredients. As you sell your goods, the app tracks your stock.
Bottle Keeper is perfect for bars, restaurants, vape stores, salons, or liquor stores, Bottle Keepers helps you determine exactly how much liquid stock you have on-hand.
One Click Reorder is ideal for food shops, this app offers a popup order history display that’s handy for upselling and learning your VIP customers’ preferences.

3. Plan for Expenses
Nothing’s worse than getting blindsided by a fridge on the fritz or a surprise tax bill. Restaurateur David Joseph created three apps designed specifically to help restaurants plan for expenses:

DAVO Sales Tax automatically collects daily sales tax, holds it securely, files it, and pays it in full on time.
Savings Club, an annual savings tool, automatically collects funds each day and returns them to you mid-December for year-end expenses.
Sweep and Save pulls a percentage of daily sales out for monthly expenses and gives it back to you on the first day of the next month.

4. Concentrate on Your Core
“We make fun, whimsical, silly doughnuts,” says Kamal. “This is what we always gotta remember first when we’re doing anything: ‘Are we making delicious doughnuts?’ And then everything else follows.”
A common challenge of small businesses, actually all businesses, is not understanding what products bring in the most money. But with the right analytics tools and a little sage advice, QSR owners can know their top sellers, their best customers, and their peak sales times.
“Clover helps us save money and produce less waste,” Kamal says. And that means more time for the important stuff–“creating the next doughnut of your dreams.”

news_468,news,Two Clover feature upgrades you should try now,Clover’s Virtual Terminal and Dashboard got great feature upgrades. Here’s what’s new in your Clover POS system. …,12-03-2019,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/2-awesome-clover-features-you-need-to-try-now/,"While many students are looking forward to spring vacation, small business owners get no such break. It’s been a long winter, and though spring feels a ways off, we’ve got some new Clover features to brighten your day. New Dashboard features and a Virtual Terminal upgrade from Clover may just be the boost you need to get through the month in lieu of a trip to Cancun. Take the time to explore these two new Clover feature upgrades.
Virtual Terminal 2.0
Virtual Terminal is a feature that many Clover merchants already know and love. This quarter, we’ve given Virtual Terminal an update.
For those unfamiliar with Clover Virtual Terminal, this tool allows merchants to enter order and payment information when they are away from their Clover device. Perhaps you’re at your computer, away from your Clover devices, and need to process a transaction. Or, you’re dealing with a frustrated customer on the phone and need to make a refund. Maybe you just want to take orders from the top of a mountain, a farmers market, or your high school reunion.
Now, Clover Virtual Terminal is available to all Clover merchants, regardless of your plan type. There are no monthly fees, and transactions are processed at the card-not-present rate. Take care of customers from any web platform: desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone. Process refunds, send digital receipts, and maintain the high level of data security that Clover values.
The only question is: where will you start accepting payments? The options are virtually limitless.
Note: at the time of publishing, Virtual Terminal is not available for Wells Fargo banking customers.
The New Clover Dashboard
Virtual Terminal isn’t the only thing getting an upgrade. The new Dashboard has launched, giving small business owners a clear snapshot of all their important data with easy navigation.
The new Dashboard design highlights key metrics at a glance, with simple navigation optimized for mobile viewing. Get quick feedback on stats like net revenue, today’s key numbers, or hourly net revenue. A new header simplifies switching between accounts, customizing your settings, and finding support information. Easily customize your view with apps from the Clover App Market. Manage employees, inventory, and merchant settings in one smooth experience.

news_472,news,Merchant talkback: How are minimum-wage hikes impacting your business?,"Whether or not your state’s rate has already gone up, it’s smart business to crunch some numbers and think about how you can prepare for higher wages in the future.
…",20-03-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/merchant-talkback-how-are-minimum-wage-hikes-impacting-your-business/,"Workers in nineteen states got a raise with the new year, as minimum wage hikes took effect across the country. A number of cities in California have also approved their own local minimum wage increases, and new rates will take effect in Oregon, Michigan, and Washington, D.C. later this year.
Labor is a major cost for small businesses, and, as a small business owner, it’s natural to worry whenever costs go up. But when it comes to the minimum wage, it’s important not to get caught up in the political hype on either side, and stay focused on your bottom line. Voters in both red and blue states have approved minimum wage increases directly through ballot measures, so whether or not your state’s rate has already gone up, it’s smart business to crunch some numbers and think about how you can prepare for higher wages in the future.
Here’s how some other small business owners are coping with minimum-wage hikes:
Outsourcing and automating
“We are actively planning for an increase over the next three years,” says Marco Giannini, the CEO of Protein for Pets, based in Los Angeles, CA. “We do have an advantage because we’ve been around for less than two years and our systems have scalability and efficiency in mind…Companies should look to outsourcing more technology and services.”

Tip: Automate time-consuming processes, like scheduling employees or keeping up with data entry.

Cutting other costs
Anita Agrawal, CEO and designer at Best Bargains, a jewelry manufacturer and retailer based in Toronto, says she’s reduced her advertising budget to make room in her budget for higher employee salaries. She says she sees the benefit of higher salaries in lower turnover and more motivated workers. “They’re much more invested in their work.”

Tip: Try renegotiating key vendor contracts, or reducing staffing costs without actually reducing staff.

Digging into data
“We are trying to use information to most effectively use our man hours,” says Rahul Nair, manager of Sunnyvale, CA-based gastropub The Oxford—for example, by redesigning the restaurant’s menu to make it more labor-efficient or reducing menu offerings during slower hours.

Tip: Consider cutting out individual products with thinner profit margins as an alternative to cutting staff.

Viewing compensation holistically
“If the rise in minimum wage had a ripple effect that ended up pushing our hourly employees to ask for more money, I would hope they would look at the entire compensation package, flexibility in scheduling, frequent free lunches, the access to 401(k), casual environment and more, and think of the entire package that we provide as an employer,” says Andrew Schiller, the CEO of Location, a data company based in Worcester, MA.

Tip: Look into offering perks that increase employee engagement without significantly increasing costs.

Being transparent with customers
Jack Stewart, the owner of Oakland, CA-based Aunt Mary’s Cafe, says they’ve added a new service charge and put up signs encouraging customers to tip only 3-5% for outstanding service. “We want to pay everybody as well as we can. If you raise the wage, then you will have more career-oriented workers who want to stay on the job,” he says.

Tip: Think about whether eliminating tips and charging higher, but more transparent, prices would work for your restaurant.

Welcoming new customers
“People making minimum wage, they’re not going to stock [a wage increase] in an overseas account, they’re going to spend it,” says Joe Chevalier, the owner of Columbia, MO-based Yellow Dog Bookshop. “This increase will come back to the community with more people spending money.”

Tip: Find ways to turn first-time visitors into loyal customers.

news_474,news,How to run a successful sales promotion,"This post examines the threats and opportunities of a number of promotional methods. Learn more about these different promotional strategies, and think about which might best serve your bottom line without devaluing your brand.…",26-03-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-to-run-a-successful-sales-promotion/,"Pricing products is one of the single most intricate aspects of running a small business. Hopefully, you’ve read about different pricing models, and perhaps even used those formulas to price your products and services more intelligently.
In the life cycle of most businesses, however, sales promotions frequently come into play. There’s a lot of research out there that suggests which kinds of sales work and which don’t, but plain observations can also tell you a lot. Bed Bath & Beyond’s famous 20% off coupons hurt their profit margins and brand reputation. But promotional marketing can be periodically effective to increase foot traffic, move products, and expand their customer base.
There’s are a lot of benefits to be gained from sales and promotions with thoughtful planning. They are most frequently used to move products that are taking up inventory space, but they are also effective at introducing a new product or service. Other side benefits include acquiring new customers and building loyalty with existing ones.
Like any business decision, however, there are also risks. Wise merchants safeguard against out-of-hand promotions by limiting the amount of units or services available for the promotion, and the amount that any individual can take advantage of a special deal. The fine-print rules of your promotion may make or break the campaign. Similarly, expect that you might need to bend the rules at some point. Inevitably, a scenario you hadn’t anticipated will develop, and you need to stay on your toes. (For example, extending a promotion by one day for a confused customer could win you some loyalty.)
This post examines the threats and opportunities of a number of promotional methods—traditional sales, bundling sales, stepped discounts, and even charitable promotions. Learn more about these different promotional strategies, and think about which might best serve your bottom line while maintaining your brand.
1. Traditional Sale

What it is: This is the type of promotional marketing many of us think of first. It can be storewide or for select products, but usually there is a general markdown. Think “10% Off Swimsuits,” or “15% off Back-to-School Supplies.” This also includes clearance racks with items physically separated and marked to sell.
Threats: It’s possible that customers will find an item they like in your store and wait for it to go on sale. If you have predictable sales patterns, this risk increases. Shoppers may start to associate the discounted price as the appropriate value for the product, which is no good for your business.
Opportunities: Traditional sales are great for moving declining product out of inventory to make space for new, perhaps trendier items–and to recoup the catch. For best results, schedule promotions around events or holidays to reduce the chances of devaluing your brand. For example, you can offer 10% off selected swimsuits for the summer equinox or 50% off mylar balloons on Valentine’s Day. Vary your promotions from year to year (if possible) and keep promotions feeling special and limited-time-only. Restrict the amount of items included in the sale to maintain the overall perceived value of your brand.
2. Bundle Sale

What it is: A bundle sale allows customers to add on to their order with a pre-determined discount. This category includes buy one get one offers, buy one get one half off, or special package discounts.
Threats: Like traditional sales, shoppers may begin to rely on these types of discounts and wait for them to occur. Additionally, instead of having customers buy from you regularly, they may use these opportunities to stock up on volume so they do not need to visit you again until the next sale.
Opportunities: Because bundle promotions don’t necessarily affect the base price of an item, they are a stronger choice to maintain value perception much of the time. For example, if you offer a dress shirt at 25% off when one is purchased at full price, shoppers will still remember the base price of the item and not be shocked if they come back when the promotion is not running. And if 25% seems steep, remember that this is essentially a 12.5% discount on two items. Psychologically, shoppers feel they are getting a better deal because of the higher percentage discount, even though it is only applied to one item. Bundling is particularly effective for introducing new products by bundling them with your best sellers.
Stepped Discount

What it is: Stepped discounts include percentage off, or specific dollar amounts back, when a customers spend a certain amount. For example, take $5 off orders above $50, or $12 off orders above $100.
Threats: If your stepped discount is too popular, you may move more items than you are intending. Because this is specifically geared to move larger volumes than average, make sure you’re prepared to do that. Consider capping the total amount for which customers can claim these discounts.
Opportunities: Stepped discounts have become increasingly common in the past few years because they read to customers more like generous offers from the store rather than an expression of desperation. These are best when you aren’t trying to move a single, specific product or product line, but rather increase foot traffic, retain loyal customers, and move product in general in a slow period of the year. Consider offering coupons for stepped discounts to specific factions of your customer base through a free Clover app like Rewards.
Charitable Promotion

What it is: A little outside of the norm, a charitable promotion doesn’t really help your bottom line in the short term, but rather elevates your brand within the community. Instead of garnering benefits of increased sales, you’re giving a certain percentage of product sales to a specific charity your customers feel good about. This can be a highly effective marketing strategy (read more about this tactic here).
Threats: Charitable promotions are not terribly effective at generating cash or solving a specific business issue like excess inventory. Think of these as long-range brand building.
Opportunities: If your business is healthy and financially stable, a charitable promotion can serve to elevate your standing in the community, while retaining the value of your offerings. Shoppers feel that they are doing something good for their community by buying your products, but their association of value with your products is unchanged. This can build brand and customer loyalty.
Choose wisely when planning your next sale or promotion, and keep your business goals in mind when selecting a promotional model. Be reasonably flexible so you can keep your customers happy and protect your bottom line. If you make your rules too specific and complicated, it won’t inspire engagement. But if you are too lax, you could be left with no inventory and not enough profit. Make your promotion strategy fun but unpredictable so that customers regularly check in on your inventory and offerings.

So much has changed in recent decades—politically, and socially—to make it okay, even encouraged, to be out and proud as an entrepreneur regardless of your gender identity or sexual orientation. While there continues to be conflict and stress for the queer community the world over, visibility is much higher, and no longer taboo in mainstream marketing and business.
This guide is meant to help demystify some of the opportunities available to LGBTQIA merchants.
Registering your business
It may not occur to you to formally register your business, but it’s definitely something to consider. Becoming an official LGBTBE (LGBT Business Enterprise) carries a number of benefits, but it is definitely a process to achieve certification. It’s worth the time to register with the NGLCC (National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce) to access their special events, grants, and networking opportunities. There are special sub-categories for trans and non-binary business owners, so look around to find the best type of application for your venture.
Other communities you may want to consider:

Continuing your education
No matter your business prowess, there is always more to learn. Continuing education is important for every business owner! If you’re thinking about going back to business school, there are LGBT-specific scholarship programs to help you learn more, get started, and achieve your business goals.
Affinity, Inc is a quarterly magazine to help you expand your knowledge about best practices for business. It’s full of resources to keep you up on the relevant issues in the business sector.
Another major organization with a yearly summit is Lesbians Who Tech. Check out their website for their incredible list of past speakers. If you can make it to one of their events, it’s definitely worth your time.

Appealing to LGBT customers
It’s no secret that the LGBT sector has a lot of money to spend. It was estimated that LGBT travel alone is a $70 billion industry. If you are a member of the LGBTQIA community, it’s important to let others in the community know that you’re open for business, whatever that business is. There’s increased LGBT marketing on network and cable television, but there are infinite ways to market your business if you don’t have the money for a TV ad. Here are some ideas:

…",27-03-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/13-must-read-money-management-tips-for-small-businesses/,"Cash is the lifeblood of any business. If you can’t master cash flow, your business may not last long: 29% of small businesses that fail run out of cash, and 82% have some kind of cash flow problems.
Managing cash flow may sound simple—just make more money than you spend—but for many small businesses, it’s trickier than it sounds. The first step to better money management is understanding where your money is going.
Here are 13 must-read money management tips for small businesses.
Cash is king
It’s more and more possible for small businesses to go completely cashless, and there are some significant benefits, starting with the clear paper trail for cashless payments. But as long as you’re accepting cash, you’ve got to create rock-solid systems for keeping track of it.

1. Start by literally keeping track of cash coming in and going out. The free Clover app Cash Log tracks all cash transactions and cash drawer activities.
2. Minimize customers’ use of cash when you can—consider using an app like Donate at Checkout, which lets customers donate change to charity.
3. Keep track of the sales tax you owe, and set aside money daily so you’re not hit with a surprise bill. The DAVO Sales Tax app automatically collects, files, and pays sales tax for you.

Manage your inventory to manage your money
Unsold inventory costs you money. It’s as simple as that. A good money management plan for your small business includes a good inventory management plan.

4. Keep your inventory as lean as possible.
5. Make sure you’re moving product quickly—inventory that sits in your store is costing you money.
6. Reduce shrinkage by tracking inventory better.

Get paid—on time
Late payments cost small businesses $3 trillion a year, and small businesses spend an average of 15 days a year chasing late payments, according to research by Sage. Don’t let your business become a statistic—make sure your clients are paying you promptly.

7. Create an organized system for invoicing your customers.
8. Set clear payment policies so customers know when payment is due and when a late fee will kick in.

Crunch your numbers
Small business money management all comes down to a few key numbers. Dig into the data to make sure that you’re making money on every single sale.

9. Run a break-even analysis on new products to make sure you’ll be able to cover your costs.
10. Negotiate for better deals with key suppliers and vendors.

Create good accounting systems
Most small business owners start out doing their books themselves. As your business grows, that job gets bigger and bigger, and you may want to hire an accountant. But no matter who is doing your books, you need strong systems to make sure you’re managing your money well.

11. Create checks and balances and backups so you’re not just trusting anyone—even your accountant—to handle your money for you.
12. Take a basic accounting class to help you better understand how your business’s finances work.

Get quick cash in a pinch
Even the best-managed business may occasionally hit a liquidity crisis. If you’re experiencing a slow season or another problem that’s causing a cash crunch, don’t panic—get help.

13. Know where to turn if your business needs a quick cash infusion. Clover Capital, for example, can get you a cash advance in as little as 3-5 days, and you’ll repay automatically from your daily sales.

news_477,news,How small businesses can use “design thinking” to improve crucial processes.,"Big companies like Apple and AirBnB use design thinking to fuel innovation and drive growth. But design thinking can be used in businesses everywhere. Here’s how to master this new approach to problem-solving to grow your business. 
…",28-03-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-small-businesses-can-use-design-thinking-to-improve-crucial-processes/,"Small business owners are often so busy, they may not have time to step back and observe their own patterns. What many small merchants don’t realize is that some of the same problems keep cropping up over and over again. This can boil down to a specific glitch where a simple shift in thinking could be the solution.
Enter: design thinking. Design thinking is a fresh approach that can help small businesses reevaluate how their habits and patterns may be that stealing their time and inhibiting growth. Big companies like Apple and AirBnB use design thinking to fuel their growth and innovation. For small businesses, this could be the secret to thinking outside the box and inspiring your business to grow to new heights.
What is design thinking?
Design thinking is a method of problem solving that focuses on humans. This particular approach seeks to understand a person’s needs, and then brainstorm solutions to meet those needs. Another way to describe design thinking is to call it a solution-based approach to problem-solving.

How does it work in practice? For small business owners, design thinking simply means applying the iterative process of designing products or services to more complex business operations or systems. There are five high-level steps to using design thinking.

Empathize
Define the problem
Explore all possible solutions
Iterate through testing
Implement a solution

source: https://bit.ly/2TXpToj
First: empathy. This step is all about setting aside your assumptions and getting in the mind of the consumer. Put yourself squarely in the customer journey: when a customer leaves your store without making a purchase, or behaves a certain way in relation to your business, what could be some of the reasons behind that behavior?
Take time to understand the problem—and make sure the problem you think that you’re solving is really the one you need to address. Identifying the hidden need of the customer is the first step to identifying a solution. Make sure you spend time speaking to some of your customers or employees to really align on what the core issue is.
Next, explore all possible solutions. Do some brainstorming to come up with some ideas that you might not normally consider. During this phase, there’s no idea too crazy: the purpose and goal is to think as far out of the box as possible.
Once you have as many solution-based ideas down as possible, go back to your list to identify the best, most feasible solutions for iteration. Iteration, or prototyping, is when you and your team test out some ideas to see what has impact. It may be that some of the solutions are still not fully thought out, and that’s ok. Repeat the process of prototyping your solution, testing, and getting user feedback until you know the design is right. Only through repeated testing will you be sure you have the right possible path forward.
Implementation is the stage in which business owners spend the most time, money, and energy. However, if you followed the rest of the steps correctly, this is also the phase where you will start to see business results impact your bottom line. Congratulations!
How can small business owners use design thinking?
If all of this feels somewhat academic, it can actually have a big impact on how your team works. One of the big advantages of design thinking is that it helps businesses of all sizes break out of unproductive cycles and “business as usual” ways of thinking. Here are a few examples of where you might use design-based thinking in your small business.

Morale is low in a restaurant’s kitchen. The restaurant owner assumes this is related to hourly wages or benefits—two expenses he can’t afford to increase at the moment. However, the business owner uses design thinking and conducts interviews with the kitchen staff. He works a few shifts and realizes that morale is low in part because employees prepare the same dishes over and over, and in part because their uniforms are itchy and uncomfortable. The solution? New uniforms.
A coffee shop wants to build a lunch business after the AM rush. The coffee shop owner isn’t sure if this is a good idea or not; so, she puts herself in the shoes of the customer. She walks outside to see how close it would be for other working professionals to walk over for lunch. She does a sweep of the neighborhood to see what other cafes are offering on their menus, and what their price points are. When it’s clear that the closest offices are at least a drive away, she comes up with the idea of selling pre-packed lunches. Now, customers can pick up lunch with their morning coffee.
A retailer sees a lot of foot traffic that doesn’t result in sales. A retailer runs an online promo inviting people to take advantage of certain deals when they come by the store This generates a lot of foot traffic, but doesn’t result in a sales bump. He assumes this has to do with the deal itself, before following the customer journey. Then, the business owner realizes his store layout is making it difficult for a new customer to find the product offered in the deal. By making some changes to the front-of-house, the business owner capitalizes on the online to offline conversion.

But your growth trajectory can be stunted if you don’t have the cash on hand to make the investments that make growth sustainable, including hiring more staff, upgrading your equipment, purchasing more inventory or extending your hours.
Growth almost always requires access to capital. The good news: there are a plethora of options for small businesses that need financing. The tricky part is figuring out which type of financing is best for your business. Here are seven common financing options you might consider:
Apply for a traditional bank loan.
A term loan is a traditional bank loan. Much like a mortgage, if approved, the bank will give you a repayment period, an interest rate, and a monthly payment. In most cases, getting a loan from a bank will be one of your cheaper options, but it can also be a slow and paperwork-intensive process, and you’ll need to have good credit. Some online lenders also offer term loans, but make sure you check the fine print. Often, you pay for the convenience of getting your cash quickly with a very high interest rate.
Go for an SBA loan.
An SBA loan is a loan made by a bank that’s partially guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. That guarantee means banks can charge very low interest rates. Repayment terms also tend to be more favorable for this loan type. However, SBA loans generally take at least a few weeks to process, so if you need cash immediately, this type of loan may not be the best for you.
Secure a business line of credit.
A line of credit is one of the more flexible options for small businesses. Once approved by a bank or online lender, you have the option to draw up to the maximum limit set, and you pay interest on whatever amount you draw. Typically, a bank will review your financials every year in order to renew the line of credit. Much like a term loan, going through a traditional bank will cost less in terms of interest rates but generally take longer and have stricter requirements. By contrast, an online lender is generally more likely to approve you and lend quickly, but may charge you more for that privilege via higher interest rates.
Get a business credit card.
For some businesses, a credit card can work like a line of credit, but with even more flexibility. You’ll need to prove that your business is creditworthy, but there’s less paperwork required for a credit card than for a line of credit. This also makes the process of getting access to capital faster. Of course, just like with your personal credit card, using it responsibly will help you build a sound credit history, but if you’re not careful, you can rack up a lot of debt quickly and tank your business’s credit profile.
Seek equipment financing.
An equipment loan is a loan provided by a bank or other lender that’s specifically structured to allow you to buy new equipment crucial to your operations. With a loan like this, the equipment itself typically serves as collateral, so you’re able to borrow a significant portion of the cost of the purchase. And of course, as with a mortgage or a car loan, once you’ve paid off your equipment loan, you own the equipment.
Consider equity financing.
Equity financing means selling shares of your business. You can either sell to individuals (known as ‘angel investors’) or to venture capital firms, investment banks, or other companies that invest in startups and small businesses. In order to invest in a private company, individuals typically must be accredited investors, meaning they have to meet certain minimums for income or net worth. If done right, equity financing can be a great way to get not just cash but also outside expertise for your business. But because you’re giving up partial control of your business, you’ll want to make sure you’re very comfortable with anyone you take on as an investor. This also a much higher-consideration process. Be sure to consult with a lawyer and an accountant to structure this correctly and ensure you have the right paperwork in place.

Opt for a cash advance.
One of the fastest ways to get cash is through a cash advance. This is essentially financing secured by your future sales. For example, if you’re a Clover merchant, you can get working capital for your business based on your average credit card sales. Repayment is automatically pegged to your credit card receipts, so you won’t be stuck with an unsustainable loan payment on the heels of a slow week. And it’s fast–approved merchants typically receive their funds in five to seven business days.
—
Deciding that you’re ready to grow is an exciting milestone in your business journey. Don’t let a lack of cash keep your business from growing. Whatever your business needs, there are plenty of ways to get financing that can help you meet your goals.

For small retailers, gift cards are a potential Goliath-slayer that can help them compete for gift shopping dollars against both online and brick-and-mortar retail giants. But gift cards also give non-retail businesses an opportunity to put themselves in the gift-giving mix. If you are a restaurant or service-based small business, you too can capture gift sales by offering gift cards. To do this, you’ll first need to create physical or digital gift cards. If you’re a Clover customer, you can use Clover Gift Cards to easily set up either or both types of gift cards, complete with custom branding.
After you’ve created your gift cards, you need to be intentional about marketing them to customers ? a step that is crucial for success. To do this, send a series of emails to your customer list announcing the availability of gift cards and recommending them as a convenient and personal gift-giving option. Publish updates about your program on your social media accounts. Post signage inside your business, including your restaurant counter, host stations, bar and/or dining room tables, register area, waiting areas, and on your window. And train your staff to offer gift cards to patrons while they’re checking out or paying their bill. Up the ante with a prize to the highest-referring employees.
2. Have an in-store upselling strategy for gift card redemptions
You’ve sold gift cards and have the upfront revenue to show for it. It’s a great start, but the promise of gift cards for adding sales lift to your business doesn’t end there.
That’s because of the redemption process. When the gift card recipient comes to your business to make purchases, it offers your business an opportunity to earn even more revenue and attract more customers. First Data’s 2018 Prepaid Consumer Insights Study revealed, on average, that consumers spend $59 more than the original value of their gift card when they redeem it.
So roll out the red carpet when customers redeem their gift cards to further endear them to your business. Retail stores might consider keeping nicely-wrapped accessories behind the counter to add to their new customers’ purchases when those customers redeem their gift cards. This strategy can also work for appointment-based businesses: consider offering sample items that customers can use to extend the life of the service you have just provided. If you’re in the restaurant business, you can consider complimentary appetizers, desserts, or drink samples that are positioned as part of the gift redemption experience.
3. Intentionally promote repeat visits
Gift cards are a great opportunity to encourage repeat visits among new customers, and that increased lifetime value means a greater return on investment for your gift card program. Don’t leave this up to chance: here are specific actions you can take to increase the likelihood that gift card redeemers become loyal customers.
Leverage gift cards to build loyalty. First Data’s 2018 Prepaid Consumer Insights Study showed that 61 percent of consumers surveyed said they prefer to receive a gift card as a reward for loyalty over a coupon or bonus.
Since gift card recipients are already using a card to make their purchase, you’re in a great position to add them to your loyalty program upon redemption. For example, if you typically offer $5 dollars in store cash for every $100 spent, and your new customer has just used their $100 gift card, then add a $5 credit to the same card as a “sign up bonus” for your loyalty program. The nice thing about this tactic is that while it will feel like an additional bonus to the recipient, who didn’t pay for the card in the first place, it will be business as usual for you.
Sign them up for communications. Your staff can also encourage gift card users to sign up to receive texts, emails, and/or mail. You can then offer an exclusive deal or bonus points to shoppers who have enrolled for the first time. (If they’re already on your mailing list as a gift card user, you can set limitations, so certain deals do not apply).
There are two primary benefits to this tactic: 1) You’ll capture their contact information, which offers you an opportunity to reach them with new promotions over time; and 2) You will force them to sign up with you before offering additional perks, increasing the likelihood that any additional deal will promote higher lifetime value for that customer ? and a return on investment for your business.
4. Track your performance, adjust and repeat
Regular readers of the Clover blog know that we never like to miss a tracking opportunity. It’s a way to see how these tips and tactics work for your actual business, and to understand what adjustments you’ll need to make in order to improve the program over time. Remember: while the gift-giving occasions can offer a nice boost in gift card activity, gift cards are a great marketing and loyalty tool that you can implement on any day of the year.
Here are two gift card program numbers that you should track for starters:
Redemption percentage. What percentage of gift cards sold are being redeemed? Again, while gift card sales represent upfront revenue for your business, redemption is where the real action is, offering an opportunity for you to collect additional revenue. Remember: people usually spend more than the original value of their gift card.
Average ticket size for all customers vs. gift card customers. This number is a great metric for gauging how much spending differs between these two customer types. We have to talk about lifetime value again here: if spending is relatively low during the initial visit, but that new customer comes back and spends with your business again, that could mean in terms of lifetime value, your gift card program is well worth the investment.

Reward moms, dads, and grads with exactly what they want by capitalizing on Clover gift cards and app integrations.…",01-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/get-your-business-ready-for-moms-dads-grads-season/,"It can be a stretch to find reasons to celebrate from March through May: with no major national holidays, your spring marketing is competing for customers’ attention with great weather and other worthy distractions—family time, spring break, March Madness, baseball season.
But spring is also the perfect time to leverage gift giving for moms, dads, and grads. Spring-summer holiday gift giving can be a bit tricky for your marketing efforts, since these occasions don’t have dedicated days and can easily fall off of your radar. Plus, there’s no one-size-fits all when it comes to gift-giving for these uniquely personal events. Right?
Not exactly. If you offering the gift that our data tells us just about everyone wants, you can simplify gift giving and open up revenue potential for your business. Selling gift cards can boost your opportunities to capitalize on gift giving even if your business is in a category not normally associated with gifts. Here are some creative ways your business can get in on the gift-giving game.
1. Gift cards are king.
By some estimates, gift cards have been the most requested item on wish lists for 10 years in a row. Gift cards are flexible enough that a mom, dad, or grad can get what they want, but also show some knowledge of the recipient’s tastes and preferences. And a gift from your business is more personal than one from a big-box brick-and-mortar or digital behemoth like Amazon. As a small business owner, you also open your business up to a whole new way to accept payments. Use a Clover-friendly app like Gift Cards to offer cards that integrate directly into your POS system.
2. Do some gift matching.
Gift cards are great, but giving back is better. A study in AdWeek revealed that seven in ten Americans like brands that engage in cause-based marketing. Recent graduates and younger customers are especially receptive to companies who support local social issues. As a business owner, consider offering a gift card as fundraiser support, or do some gift card matching: one lucky gift card recipient will have a matching amount of their card value donated to a local cause, or each gift card purchase within a specific date range supports a micro-donation (say, a dollar per gift card) to a local organization up to a maximum amount set by you.
3. Give the gift that keeps on giving.
Mother’s Day and Father’s Day are awfully commercial holidays—why not celebrate mom and dad all year long? Deploy your rewards program to increase customer loyalty around these two holidays. A gift card can be used to reward customers for repeat visits or for spending a certain amount of money at your business. One study showed that 75% of customers spend $38 more on average than the value of their gift cards when they redeem them. When a customer redeems their card, hook them on your loyalty rewards program to keep them coming back.
4. Jazz up your program
Gift cards don’t have to be boring. Moms, dads, and grads deserve a little fun, and there are some creative options out there for customers who want to give cash. Add an app like Scratch Card Wali to your gift card experience: when a customer checks out using a gift card, this app gives them a scratch-off surprise (a free dessert or coffee next time they come back, for example).
Think outside the box—literally—when it comes to reaching new and loyal customers this spring. Never miss an opportunity to let your customers share your name around town with Clover apps and gift cards.

news_481,news,5 questions to ask: Are you ready for the next live event near you?,"Small businesses don’t need to spend millions of dollars to capitalize on high-visibility events like the Super Bowl. Before the next live event in your community, prepare to see a bump in business by asking these five questions and using Clover Flex. 
…",02-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-are-you-ready-for-the-next-live-event-near-you/,"In 2018, brands spent an estimated $480 million on advertising during the Super Bowl. A 30-second TV spot cost $5.24 million alone—but with nearly 100 million viewers, many companies are willing to fork over the big bucks to be featured in high profile events.
Most businesses don’t have a cool five million dollars to spend on one event. But, for small businesses, high profile events can still bring in a significant business bump. Whether it’s the Super Bowl, Coachella, March Madness, or a big business conference, small businesses located near such events can profit from their proximity. All it takes is a little strategy and preparation for merchants to bring in more foot traffic, visibility, and buzz around their brand. Here are five questions merchants should ask to get ready for the next big event in their community.
1. How will you stand out?
Out-of-towners present a big opportunity for some new business: as long as they know you exist. How are new customers visiting for a short time going to hear about your business? Do a little “lightning marketing”—short term, highly targeted advertising—separate from your traditional marketing to spread the word about your business. Look for ways to partner with event organizers to be featured in event programs, online, or somewhere at the event site.
Likewise, you should have a strategy for capitalizing on the buzz you build during this short time. Ask for reviews on your platform of choice. Be prepared for an influx of online reviews via Google Business or Yelp—and have a strategy to respond to feedback, both good and bad.
2. Who are your new customers?
The first step to capitalizing on a live event is being able to tailor your offering to the attendees. A business conference is going to have a very different set of consumers than a music festival. Talk to the event organizers to find out how many tickets are being sold, what the event schedule is, and who the main event attendees will be. This can help you tailor your offering, plan for dips and peaks in foot traffic, and be strategic in how many “special promotions” you give out.
For example, a restaurant may offer a 2-for-1 lunch deal to business conference attendees looking to do some networking between conference sessions; at an all-day music festival, it might be a better strategy to box up some lunches that people can buy with their morning coffee. Know who is coming, and when, to make sure your business is ready to go.
3. Should you provide a limited-time offer or special promotion?
Some businesses use a live event as an opportunity to test a new product or service, packaging it as a limited-time offer or special promotion. Try a new marketing message, mix up your menu, or bundle products together in a new way to see how visiting consumers will respond. This is a good opportunity to get data points quickly—is this going to work for your existing customers? Is this menu item something that will bring in profit? Use the live event to test something without the risk of alienating your existing customer base.
A “special promotion” can also be a quick way to move inventory. Bundle deadstock with some of your best-selling items to cross sell or upsell to a completely new audience. Build a package that speaks directly to the consumer coming in from out of town, while also moving product your normal customers haven’t gone for in the past.
Alternately, high-visibility moments may not be the best time to try new things. If your goal is to capitalize on the increased demand, maybe you want to limit your offerings to those high-value items: best-sellers or high margin items that can reliably deliver a big profit. Limiting your offerings can also help speed up operations and optimize inventory management. Streamline your menu or offer a “game-day” special on those items you know people will go for.
4. What’s the ideal staffing for live event days?
During the Super Bowl, Pizza Hut sells an estimated 2 million pizzas in franchises around the US. That one night of frenzied dough-flipping actually takes days, if not weeks, to prepare. From folding pizza boxes to chopping ingredients, there’s a lesson there for any business expecting a big surge in business.
Staffing up for live events is a given, but it’s a little more complicated than just making sure your team is available. How much staff do you need a few days in advance to prepare? Break it down to a timetable, starting with an hour-by-hour approach to the live event day and working out. For example, if the game starts at 7:30PM, pre-drinks and early dinner may begin as soon as 5PM. Then it might be dead until the game lets out at 10PM. You’ll need a team in earlier in the day for ingredients prep, and a team after to help clean up. Optimize your hourly crew based on these anticipated ebbs and peaks.
5. Are you (physically) ready for the foot traffic?
Is your store ready to bring in new customers? Consider your front-of-house experience, and how customers will be drawn into your location. You should also think about crowd control: if you’re a bar right next to a stadium, you’re the obvious spot for pre-game drinks. But you might also be the nearest overflow bathroom when the stadium’s are crowded. How is your team going to handle the influx of people? A tool like Clover Flex provides merchants with maximum flexibility to unchain themselves from the counter and take orders wherever the customer happens to be. Get ready to meet your new customers, close the sale, and capture the event bump to its fullest potential.

news_482,news,Design for better business: Launching your restaurant right,"You’ve spent months of your life, and thousands of dollars, working towards this moment: it’s time to launch your restaurant. The right launch strategy can help set you up for long-lasting success. Here are 5 tips for launching your restaurant right.
…",03-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/design-for-better-business-launching-your-restaurant-right/,"You’ve raised the money, hired the staff, and planned the menu. You’ve spent months of your life and thousands of dollars working towards this moment: it’s time to launch your restaurant. You’re bound to be nervous—you’re about to find out if all your hard work is going to pay off. But the right launch strategy can help set you up for long-lasting success. Here are 5 tips for launching your restaurant right:
1. Create a consistent brand identity.
Your launch strategy actually starts well before your launch. If you haven’t already written a mission statement for your restaurant or come up with a clear idea of your brand identity, make this part of your pre-launch planning. If you’ve already got your space set up and your menu planned, jot down some key words and phrases that describe the look and feel of your restaurant—and then make sure that your website, your social media accounts, and your promotional materials are all telling the same story.
Learn from the best—look at how successful restaurants and chains design their online and social media presence as an extension of the story they’re telling IRL. Sweetgreen, for example, has created an iconic brand by focusing on core values like sustainability. Take a look at their Instagram feed to see how they translate that clean, positive aesthetic into social content:


2. Start your marketing long before your opening.
Speaking of social media, start getting social early. Invite your audience along for the journey as you get ready for your launch. Share images of the decor as the space comes together, share images of the recipes you’re testing or the menu design you’re working on—give people a chance to get to know you before you even open your doors. Instagram is great for sharing images that give people a glimpse behind the scenes, and creating a Facebook page is a great way to get the basic info on your restaurant out there and answer questions from potential customers.


Make sure you have a mobile-optimized website for your restaurant well in advance of your launch, and make sure you’re listed on places like TripAdvisor, Yelp, and OpenTable so potential customers will find you when they’re looking for a place to eat nearby.
3. Consider a soft opening.
A grand opening can be a great way to get press attention and draw in potential customers with a special event that makes them feel like insiders. But a soft launch, where you invite a gradually expanding group of friends and neighbors to dine with you over the course of a few days, has a lot of advantages, too.
You can start with a fixed, limited menu and a few trusted friends. Offer the food for free and ask for feedback. A second or third event might invite some neighbors, or front-of-house staff’s friends and families, and offer meals at a discount or on a pay-what-you-wish system. Send out invitations to make these meals feel like special occasions.

4. Reach out to your community.
Cast a broad net when you’re inviting folks to come to your soft opening or grand opening events. You’ll want to invite local media, of course, but don’t forget local politicians, bloggers, and online influencers. Inviting your vendors is a great way to thank them for all their help getting the restaurant ready—and enlist them to help build positive word of mouth.
Make sure you reach out to your neighbors. If you’re in a mixed or residential area, those people could become your new regulars, so make sure you identify them as VIPs to staff. If you’re in a business district, reach out to the office managers at nearby firms, the owners and managers of retail stores, or the concierge at a nearby hotel. Recommendations from people in the area can drive a lot of foot traffic your way.
Consider donating part of your profits to charity on your opening day or at your grand or soft opening events. Don’t forget branding here, either—choose a charity that helps you tell the story you want to tell, whether that’s about sustainability and organic food, a warm family atmosphere, or giving back to your community.



5. Create ‘bounce back’ potential.
At your opening events, give out coupons that are good for just a month or two, to encourage your (hopefully) happy new customers to come back again soon. A bounce back promotion could offer something like a free appetizer, a discount or a free drink at happy hour, or even a buy-one-get-one deal. Ideally, it should expire fairly quickly, to create a sense of urgency that encourages the customer to follow through and come back.

One creative idea is to create a kind of mystery gift—give guests a sealed envelope, so they don’t know what their reward will be until they come back. Or tie the promotion to a holiday, like this restaurant that created red envelopes containing discount offers for a Chinese New Year promotion.

Whether you choose to do a soft opening over several days or a big, splashy grand opening event, launching your restaurant is a make-or-break moment, so you want to make sure you get all the details right—including the design. Make sure all your promotional materials, invitations, and social media posts are telling the same story. Hopefully, it’s a story your customers will want to be a part of.

news_483,news,Merchant talkback: What’s your best advice for achieving work-life balance?,"Running a small business can be all-consuming. Being passionate about your work can give you the drive you need to succeed, but that passion also has a dark side—burnout. 
…",04-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/merchant-talkback-whats-your-best-advice-for-achieving-work-life-balance/,"Running a small business can be all-consuming. Especially if you founded your own company, chances are good that you’re the first person called in any crisis and the last person to leave at night. Being passionate about your work can give you the drive you need to succeed, but that passion also has a dark side—burnout.
In one recent survey, 25% of entrepreneurs reported feeling ‘moderately’ burned out. Researchers also found that entrepreneurs were much more likely to report burnout if they were focused on money, status, and success. People who were passionate about their work but focused mostly on the memorable experiences it gave them were much less stressed, and much more able to take breaks and achieve a better work-life balance.
Here are four tips from other small business owners for balancing your business and your life:
1. Think of self-care as a way to support your business.
“I like to think of my mental energy as a health bar from a video game. Everything I do—writing sales pages, checking and double-checking our funnels, talking to customers, even thinking about work, etc.—will steal a little chunk from that bar until it gets completely depleted, at which point it’s ‘game over.’ So rather than looking at self-care as this optional luxury that makes you think ‘it’s nice to have but not now, thanks,’ think of it as the magic potion that helps replenish your health bar and gear you up for the emotional and mental strain of sustaining your chaotic entrepreneur life over the long run,” says Stephanie Lee, who writes about how to build a healthy life while following your passion at TheFYSlife.com.

TIP: It’s easy to put self-care last on your list, but you should actually make even more time for breaks when you’re feeling busy or overwhelmed. You’ll be more productive if you step away every now and then.

“Different kinds of self-care should address the different parts of ourselves; mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical…Taking into account our whole selves is key to taking care of us, just like recognizing a child has to eat, has to go to school, has to learn spiritual concepts, and has to play,” says Rabbi Jacob Rupp, the founder of San Diego-based Lift Your Legacy.

TIP: Remember that self-care doesn’t have to cost money, and it doesn’t have to be Instagrammable. Check out this list of simple self-care techniques for ideas, including snuggling with your pets, cleaning out your junk drawer, and journaling.

2. Prioritize family or personal time so it doesn’t get lost in the shuffle.
“I will unplug when I get home. Family and home come first before any business. It’s fleeting, so don’t miss all the little things! And then good doughnuts help a lot too!” tweets Charlotte, N.C.-based Magnolia Emporium.

TIP: Take a moment to center yourself before you walk through the door, so your family always has your full attention when you’re at home.

“I try to cut all waste out of my life, and the commute is a waste…Entripy and home can never be far apart,” says Jas Brar, the CEO of Oakville, Ontario-based Entripy Custom Clothing.

TIP: Cutting your commute, including the time you spend driving to school or daycare, can free up a lot more time to spend with your family.

“By…prioritizing my relationship with my family, I am constantly demonstrating that I will always show up no matter what. I have built a reputation with my wife and son as always being there, supporting and being a pillar for the family. I do this by over-communicating every day, listening intently and being fully present with them when I’m around. By putting the happiness of your family first, you will find it benefits you in every other part of your life,” says Gordon Light, founder of Plymouth, M.A.-based SOBAM Gear Co.

TIP: Set clear limits—create a schedule, stick to it, and try not to take work home.

3. Take care of your body to avoid burnout.
“The advice I would give a founder that is on the edge of burning out is to immediately step away from work for a bit. Over-working will only make productivity diminish and could have detrimental longer term results to the business,” says David Reischer, CEO of LegalAdvice.com.

TIP: Make sure you’re getting enough sleep, and give yourself some screen-free time before bed.

“One trick I use is to make going outside an actual routine every morning. I’m still learning how to incorporate this comfortably into my routine, because I hate going outside unless I’m perfectly kempt and my hair and makeup look acceptable for public consumption. But, instead of putting on real clothes, I’ll step outside in my leggings and t-shirt, put on some sunglasses if I have to, and take a quick walk to a coffee shop or walk around the block. One other way to assure you get outside in the morning is by walking to the gym, or taking your morning phone calls while taking a walk,” writes Alisha Ramos, the founder of Girls’ Night In.

TIP: Getting outside—and even better, getting out in nature—can actually boost your productivity, and exercise can reduce stress. Even a few minutes a day can help.

4. Be gentle with yourself.
“Say things to yourself like, ‘I acknowledge that I am behind on a million things, but I am only human. What I am doing is difficult. I am doing my best, and I feel great about that. Worst case scenario, someone will have to wait several days to hear back from me, but that’s okay,’” writes Ramos.

TIP: Start small when you’re trying to create healthy habits. Give yourself some easy wins and then build from there.

Managing your finances, inventory, staff, and customer experience can keep you on your toes day and night.These smart tools can streamline your business and give you an edge over your competition.…",09-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/4-awesome-apps-full-service-restaurants-need-now/,"When you run a restaurant, you need to bring your A-game. Managing your finances, inventory, staff, and customer experience can keep you on your toes day and night. But it doesn’t have to be a grind. These smart tools can streamline your business and give you an edge over your competition.
The following apps for restaurant owners are specifically designed for those who want an innovative approach to doing business better. With a few clicks, you’ll be on your way to improving your online ordering process, simplifying tip pooling among staff, managing inventory more transparently, and easing communications between servers and the kitchen staff. This list of best restaurant apps will be a game changer.
Menufy Online Ordering
This restaurant management app uses your menu in Clover to automatically generate a website for online ordering. It charges only $1.50 per order, which you can absorb or pass along to the customer. This single low charge per order is cheaper than signing up with multiple online ordering providers who all take a big cut. Also, the multiple-provider route creates multiple generic online menus, which can confuse customers. With Menufy, customers know they’re ordering from the right place. Plus, the easy customer experience—no login or account creation required, multiple payment options, simple checkout—drives orders and repeat business.
Tip Pooling
If you’re a restaurant that pools tips, you recognize that everyone on staff—not just the servers—plays an essential role in making customers happy. But collecting, tracking and distributing tips among servers, bartenders, bussers and other staff can get cumbersome. Tip Pooling does all that heavy lifting right within the Clover ecosystem. Using previously inputted data, the app manages tip pooling, revenue sharing with employees, and peer-to peer distributions. Managers or bookkeepers receive automatic revenue reports by employee on a daily or weekly basis. It even splits tips among order takers when you have a single cashier, so even if an order taker doesn’t close the order, they still get their tip. It’s the app that benefits that everyone from the hostess to the owner.
MarketMan Restaurant Inventory
MarketMan will get your purchasing and inventory management under control. This single app allows you to track the cost of goods sold, monitor inventory in real time and place orders to suppliers without picking up the phone. It helps restaurants big and small, allowing teams to manage inventory and place orders precisely when needed, which leads to less waste and huge savings in time and money. As a cloud-based system, it also sends real time reports and alerts, like when inventory is low or when a menu item becomes less profitable. MarketMan is a powerhouse in restaurant apps.
ChefTab KDS Interface
Save time and supplies by communicating orders directly to your kitchen through a kitchen display. The ChefTab KDS Interface includes touch screen and bump bar functionality, making it a tough performer even in the harshest kitchen environments. This tool is so easy to learn, it won’t require training; your staff will be happy to ditch the old school ticket wheel for this high tech upgrade. Subscription costs are the same no matter how many displays you use, so if you have a large kitchen, it will work just as well!

news_485,news,Business accelerators: Making seasonal planning events work for you,"Black Friday and Small Business Saturday are two marquee events that many merchants prepare for—but what about seasonal events like back-to-school or the start of spring? Capitalize on seasonal trends to boost sales and increase foot traffic. 
…",10-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-making-seasonal-planning-events-work-for-you/,"Black Friday and Small Business Saturday are two marquee events that many merchants prepare for months in advance. Small Business Saturday alone can generate up to 166% more revenue for merchants in just one day. It’s not hard to anticipate the uptick in sales and prepare your inventory accordingly for those two major small business holidays. But, what about those seasonal events—times like back-to-school—when consumers tend to purchase products en masse?
Planning for events when foot traffic will spike and customers will demand specific offerings can boost business, create opportunities to connect to your customers, and establish yourself as an expert in the field. Merchant planning to increase foot traffic and capitalize on seasonal purchasing patterns will accelerate business growth. Here are some ways to anticipate seasonal trends to increase your sales.
Get creative with your planning.
What are some unexpected ways your business can participate in big-ticket seasonal events? Find ways to be creative in your promotions. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

Gyms: launch a winter beach-body class series after the holidays to get New Year’s resolution setters in the door and ahead of the curve(s).
Cooking: offer special holiday prep workshops around Thanksgiving, Christmas, Passover and Easter, or grilling workshops in the summer.
Gardening centers: offer spring cleaning tips for sprucing up the garden and getting your front lawn ready for the season.
Auto repair: host a back-to-school car wash to celebrate seniors and teachers or to benefit the local public schools.

A seasonal event may not seem like it fits with your specific vertical, but small businesses are the backbone of the community. How can you creatively participate in events with the rest of your neighborhood?
Cross-promote with other merchants.
Some businesses have found ways to expand their marketing during seasonal events by teaming up with businesses in other verticals. For example, a gardening store and a book store might cross promote their products, offering Gardening for Dummies at check-out of the plant center or some seed packets at the register of the book store. Pick a merchant who is in a complementary, rather than competitive, market and who can help you reach a new customer base.
Run a targeted marketing campaign.
Back-to-school is a big seasonal marketing opportunity—and not just for merchants selling school supplies. Other businesses can capitalize on student shopping season with targeted promotions to parents and teachers. For example, salons and massage parlors can offer discounts for stressed parents or teachers prepping to meet their new class. Cafes can offer discounted “happy hour” lattes for parents after they drop off their kids. Seasonal merchants who think outside their own “season” can increase foot traffic and reach new customers by expanding their seasonal planning scope.
Reward loyal customers.
Many merchants are already familiar with the 80/20 rule—and that it’s critically important to keep your regulars coming back time and time again. For some customers, loyalty may only come once a year during these critical selling seasons. Look at your historic sales data to see if there are some types of products that customers are purchasing regularly, but infrequently. Can you increase their basket size by cross-selling and bundling other products with that one item they keep coming back for? Can a loyalty program increase their purchasing frequency? Try hosting a VIP event to reconnect with your customers and reaffirm their commitment to shopping at your business.
Train your staff.
Seasonal events can demand a lot of your staff. Set them up for success by providing training and education around your products or menu so they are equipped to handle questions as they come in. If you are adding seasonal staff members, make sure they are familiar with your business and equipped to represent you well. According to experts, businesses that invest in employee training have a 24% higher profit margin than those who do not. Your employees can help position your business as helpful, expert, and friendly; but only if you give them the tools to do so.
Proactively manage your inventory.
Look through historic sales data to know how much, and of what product, you can expect to move. Dead stock doesn’t just cost a business the amount spent to procure the inventory. There are hidden costs, including the opportunity cost, distribution costs, employee wages to stock and manage the inventory, and more. Clover’s POS can help with inventory management, and it’s important to recognize when a product that you may only sell once a year is becoming obsolete or in need of a refresh. Retailers focusing on back-to-school or holiday shopping trends should read up on industry reports to make sure they have the item that people will be searching for.
Seasonal peaks and valleys are to be expected, and with a little planning, staff training, and creative marketing, your business can make the most of the calendar year to accelerate business growth.

news_486,news,5 reasons restaurants fail & how to avoid them,"If you’re in the restaurant business, somebody’s probably told you that most restaurants fail. You don’t want your restaurant to become a grim statistic. Here are 5 reasons restaurants fail—and how to avoid them.…",11-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-reasons-restaurants-fail-how-to-avoid-them/,"If you’re in the restaurant business, somebody’s probably told you that most restaurants fail. Alarming statistics float around online: 60% of restaurants fail within a year, 80% within five years. But the research doesn’t quite bear this fatalism out. One study done in 2014 found that only 17% of restaurants fail in their first year—which is actually slightly lower than the 19% failure rate for other service businesses. The smallest restaurants were the riskiest, however. Restaurants with five or fewer employees tend to fail a little more often than other very small startups.
Whatever the research shows, you don’t want your restaurant to become a grim statistic. Here are 5 reasons restaurants fail—and how to avoid them:
1. They chose the wrong location.
Location can make or break any small business, and restaurants are no exception. You need a steady stream of foot traffic, but you also need a rent payment you can manage every month.

Think like a customer when scouting locations. What are the natural routes through the area? Where will people park?
Understand the neighborhood you’re looking at. Is it active during the day? In the evenings? Research shows that areas with more renters than homeowners may be better for restaurants.
Prepare for a negotiation when you’re ready to sign a lease. You can and should counter-offer—but do your homework first.
If you’re stuck in a sub-par location, look for ways to work around the problems. Can you use signage to draw the eye to an out-of-the-way storefront? Can heavy curtains and carpets help dampen the noise from the nightclub next door?

2. They don’t manage staff well.
Poor customer service can tank your restaurant, especially these days, when your reputation can so easily be damaged by even one bad review online. So you’re going for great customer service—and that starts with the way you manage and train your staff.

For front-of-house roles, hire more for attitude than for experience. It’s easier to train someone to use a POS system than to turn a grouch into a great host.
The turnover rate in the restaurant business is over 70%. Hiring and training new staff is a huge expense—avoid it by creating a workplace people will love.
Consider eliminating tipping and offering benefits so you’re offering a career, not just a job.
Managers make all the difference in whether employees are happy and productive—or disengaged. Great managers give people autonomy and create a team spirit.

3. They didn’t make a business plan.
You don’t have to have an MBA to run a small business, but you do need to take some time to plan for the future. And yes, there will be math on this exam.

What sets your restaurant apart from the crowd? A compelling brand identity can help build customer loyalty.
Do a break-even analysis. This planning tool helps you understand how long it will take your restaurant to become profitable.
Secure the right type of financing to help carry you through the startup phase.
Price your menu carefully to set yourself up for success.

4. They don’t manage money well.
A restaurant could be packed every night and still lose money—if the food isn’t priced right, or it’s overstaffed, or any of a number of other cash-flow issues crop up. Dig into the numbers to make sure that your business is sustainable for the long haul.

Get a handle on your cash flow—starting with the literal cash coming through your doors.
Know what numbers to track to understand the health of your business.
Minimize mistakes by setting up clear, easy-to-use systems for things like putting in orders, clocking employees in and out, and managing reservations.
Automate as much as possible to maximize your productivity.

5. The food wasn’t great.
Don’t forget the basics! In a world where any food a customer craves can be at their door in under an hour, you’ve got to provide a great dining experience to keep people coming back.

Make sure you’re training your staff well so that they feel like they own their station, and can fill in on other stations if needed.
Get both front and back of house staff unified around the menu, quality control, and the overall vision for your restaurant.
Do regular tastings to make sure that quality isn’t slipping.

news_487,news,6 Tax Day GIFs for small businesses,"Tax season is tough, but Clover is here to make it a little more fun to meet your filing deadline with these six GIFs. …",15-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/6-tax-day-gifs-for-small-businesses/,"Unless you’re an accountant or a CPA, tax season is the worst season. It’s that time of year when business owners have to hand over their hard-earned dollars to the government. One of the hardest parts is simply figuring out how much you owe and understanding the IRS form instructions. But, hopefully at the end of the month, you’ll be rewarded by a big tax return for growing and running a successful small business.
To make tax season a little less painful, enjoy these GIFs that speak to the trials and tribulations of filing your tax return.
When someone asks if your taxes are ready…

Filing your taxes late comes with steep penalties. Luckily, if you’re way behind schedule, you can ask for an extension until October.
When you try to figure out which tax forms you need to file…

There are so. many. tax forms. Depending on where your business is located and the type of entity you are, there are different forms you will need to file. Here’s a quick guide to help you out:

Sole proprietors and single-member LLCs: Schedule C, part of your regular Form 1040.
Partnerships and multi-member LLCs: Form 1065 and each partner needs to fill out a Schedule K-1 form.
S-Corporations: Form 1120 S and a Schedule K-1 form.

When you try to read the instructions on the tax form…

The 1040EZ has 33 pages of instructions. Try using a tax software instead to make it easier to claim your expenses and deductions. The Clover App Market can help make tax time easier by syncing with your tax software and automatically applying tax rates to each transaction.
When you start claiming business write-offs…

This year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have an impact on your tax return. There are some itemized job expenses that have been repealed for the 2018 tax year, including the unreimbursed job expenses deduction. There are other deductions that you can still take advantage of, including tax preparation fees and volunteer work donations. Check out this list from Entrepreneur for some possible tax deductions you may be able to claim.
When your employees ask for their 1099s…

What’s a 1099, you ask? According to Quickbooks, “if you employ contractors and paid them more than $600 in business-related payments, then you will need to prepare and issue an IRS Form 1099-MISC.” You guessed it: if you don’t send out the 1099s, there is a penalty.
When you realize your return is big…

Of course, some small merchants put that money right back into their business. But congratulations: you made it through another tax season and another year of successful operations! Take some time to treat yourself to something special. You’ve earned it.

news_490,news,How to leverage the power of micro-influencers to increase sales,"If you’re just starting out, we’re here to guide you on one very practical and important way to build your community while growing your business at the same time. Leverage the power of micro-influencer to increase sales and broaden your reach with these practical tips.
…",23-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-to-leverage-the-power-of-micro-influencers-to-increase-sales/,"For many small businesses, dedicating a large budget to marketing is in most cases impossible. Traditional forms of marketing like billboards, commercials, and newspaper ads are reserved for brands with money to spare. However, if you’re just starting out, we’re here to guide you on one very practical and important way to build your community while growing your business at the same time.
You’ve probably heard of influences on social media, but what about micro-influences? Micro-influencers have 1,000 – 100,000 followers and can help take your brand to the next level. They often speak to a niche audience ensuring you the reach the people you desire with profitable, guaranteed returns. Most micro-influencers cost less than traditional influencers, and depending on your vertical, can sometimes get you better results. Finding micro-influencers doesn’t have to be challenging and we’re here to show you how to leverage them to increase your sales.
Finding Micro-influencers
When looking for micro-influencers, you don’t have to look too far. These people are your followers, customers, and live in the hashtags you already use to promote your brand. To identify your ideal influencer, comb through your hashtags and see who is engaged. It won’t be hard to recruit since people are already expressing an interest. Your customers already believe in your product and are able speak to your brand in a very authentic way.
Create a Mutually Beneficial Relationship
After identifying the best micro-influencers to represent your brand, establish a mutually beneficial relationship. You want to make your influencers feel special and proud to be representing your brand. You can do this by offering discounts, free products, and exclusive offers. If you can’t offer to pay a fee, these are great alternatives, especially if they’re already customers!
Encourage influencers to convert friends
Influencers need to do more than just post images of your product. Have a discussion with them about a Call To Action (CTA)—something that encourages their followers not just to observe your products, but engage with them directly. Offer friends and family discounts and encourage them to share with their followers with added incentives for doing so. This creates a broader reach.
Create a Community
Use your micro-influencers to create a community. Encourage your influencers to host their own meetups in their regions. That way your brand is spread far and wide without you having to necessarily be there. This could be virtually or in person. It’s important to test multiple scenarios to see what sticks. Use your micro-influencers to do just that.
Brand Storytellers
Your goal is to turn your micro-influencers into brand evangelists that can tell your story as well as you can. You want them to speak from a place of knowing and love for your brand. Consumers can spot messages or promotional posts that are inauthentic, and it is extremely important to choose influencers that are earnestly committed to your brand’s overall growth. Storytelling is an art form, and with the right influencers it can take your brand and the sales of your product to the next level.

But how much do you actually know about the basic types of loyalty programs? While there are more than a handful of types when it comes to loyalty programs, most programs fall into one of the following three buckets in one way or another.
So which type is right for your store? Below we’ve outlined the pros and cons behind the three main types of loyalty programs so you can decide which is best for you.
Type 1: Frequency Program – Classic Punch Card
Everyone knows about this one right? It’s your classic buy 9, get the 10th free punch card scheme that businesses have been using since the beginning of time to encourage patrons to visit—and buy—more frequently. And there are good reasons that it’s so popular.
Pros:

It’s simple—customers can’t help but understand how it works.
It’s incredibly low cost to run. A few printed cards and you’re off and running.
It’s easy to set up tiers that reward for ever-increasing levels of purchase behavior.

Cons:

It relies on customers to bring a physical thing with them to the store—sometimes that’s a lot of responsibility for customers.
It’s really easy for customers to cheat the system—a custom whole punch or stamp is very necessary.
Its simplicity is its downfall—you don’t collect any information about customers, or about complimentary purchases, barring any further marketing efforts based on what you learn.

Type 2: Points Program
The second most popular type of loyalty program is a points program (think your airline miles credit card). In this type of program, points are allocated to the customer based on spending behavior.
Pros:

Like the frequency program, it’s also simple to understand for customers—buy X get Y points.
Also easily tiered for customers to achieve even greater rewards for greater purchases.
It’s consistent—there’s no change in rewards for sales. What you spend equals the points you get.

Cons:

This type, more than others, usually makes users have to wait the longest to collect—there’s no instant gratification.
Maintaining the program takes more effort—you have to keep track for customers, and then remind them of where they’re at.

Type 3: Cash Back Program
Another very popular type of loyalty program is the cash back or rebate program. In this type, users earn money back from previous purchase behavior that they can then spend on future purchases, effectively discounting the future purchase.
Pros:

Customers love cash, and accruing cash back is a great way to make a customer feel good about frequenting your business.
Requiring users to spend the reward in your store drives users back for additional visits—always a good thing for a business owner.
It’s simple to understand for customers—spend X, get Y back.

Cons:

Users have to wait to redeem their reward. Cash back rates are usually low so it takes a couple visits for users to build a reward worth spending.
It can be expensive to build rewards since, again, usually the rewards are so low.
If customers come to your store infrequently, this type of program may have less appeal to them.

Believe it or not, it happens. But there are ways to protect yourself. We have a few bulletproof tips to prevent determined fraudsters from working your program’s loopholes to score free stuff.
1.     Avoid “visits-based” programs.
The #1 way to keep program fraud low is to choose a partner whose loyalty program validates actual purchases, not “visits.” Require customers to check in with their real name at the register in order to receive points or punches based on a purchase they ring up on the spot.
In contrast, “visits-based” programs allow customers to validate themselves independent of any purchase. To game this system, a fraudster can simply “check in” with their device to earn points. Rinse. Repeat. No validation is just begging for fraud.
Of course, tying your loyalty data to purchases makes sense for reasons beyond fraud. By connecting the dots between check-ins and purchases, you’re able to know your customers’ buying habits better, enabling you to make smarter marketing choices for loyal customers.
2.     Establish a benchmark.
There are friendly employees. And then there are employees who are overly generous awarding points or punches. To reduce this source of soft fraud, establish a benchmark for how many program participants you have and how often they make purchases. Determine your usual “run rate” in a given week. Then, if you notice deviations from that benchmark, you might be dealing with a less-than-honest cashier who’s rewarding their friends. And it never hurts to let employees know you’re watching how they dole out rewards.
3.     Watch your daily stats.
Stay attuned to your loyalty program’s daily stats, too. In the unlikely-but-unfortunate event that you hire a bad apple, you might discover this person has awarded lots of perks to friends on their way out the door. A spike like this won’t show up in weekly benchmark checks, but a quick daily review will reveal the problem immediately.
Again, watching your daily loyalty stats makes sense on multiple levels. You’ll be able to use your program to get a feel for your regulars, their “usual” order, and when they like to stop in. Why not use this info to train your staff, too? Make a point to check-in to your loyalty program as part of your workday. It only takes a few seconds and it can go a long way in reducing fraud.
4.     Always give customers the benefit of the doubt.
Imagine your #1 customer drops by for their AM coffee and leaves their phone at home. You’d never deny a great customer points on a technicality, right? Make sure you have enough flexibility in your system to award points or purchases post-purchase, so you can cut a loyal customer some slack if you choose. (You can reserve this feature for management only, too, so those less-than-honest cashiers described above can’t exploit this feature.)
Loyalty marketing is all about establishing strong, lasting customer relationships. Ideally, your loyalty program attunes you and your staff to your best customers as your business and your team grows. Act in a generous, relationship-building spirit, and your customers will respond in kind.
The good news is two-fold: first, loyalty program fraud is easy to control. Second, taking these simple steps will not only help you reduce fraud, it’ll help you maximize the overall value of your program.
Why not cultivate the right habits from the start?

news_493,news,Crowd pleasers: Launch a VIP customer rewards program,"Today, thanks to the robust yet easy-to-use analytics packages rolled into today’s better point of sale systems, it’s never been easier to know who are your best customers—which is why right now is the perfect time launch a VIP customer rewards program.
…",29-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-launch-vip-customer-awards-program/,"It’s never been easier to know which customers are your most valuable. Businesses of all sizes can access useful sales data through robust, yet easy-to-use analytics packages rolled into point-of-sale systems. But what do you do with the information you discover? Reward your biggest spenders and most loyal customers with special VIP perks.
A lot of businesses understand how to launch a loyalty program. But identifying and rewarding your most valuable customers has never been more important.
The Pareto principle has been, more or less, accurately describing customer value generation (80% of value being generated by 20% of customers) for the last century. In the age of social media and viral news stories, however, businesses have really doubled down on identifying and rewarding their best customers while delivering next-level customer service.
Businesses like Nordstrom and LL Bean have made excellent customer service, like liberal return policies, part of their business model, rolling the cost of treating the customer like a king or queen into regular business expenses over the decades. And they’ve been rewarded handsomely for it from a loyal customer base during that time.
But for small businesses, the cost of providing high-end perks for your top-shelf customers on a well-drink budget can be a considerable challenge.
Fortunately, it doesn’t have to cost a lot to show your top customers you care about them and their business.
Here are some ways businesses might be able to show the top customers that their loyalty is appreciated.

Cafes can offer free refills to regulars. Keeping a customer’s cup of joe hot has long been a staple of great American customer service. Also, offering discounts during off hours or give-aways on fresh baked goods at the end of the day are great ways to get regular customers back in your store for a second time in a day.
Novelty and gift shops do some of their most brisk business during the holidays, with many offering free gift wrapping and bows to entice customers in the doors during this high-competition time of year. So why not offer this same service year round?
Restaurants have been known to comp diners when things go bad, but why should that be the only time you’re looking to send a customer away smiling? Sending a surprise free appetizer or dessert over to a table of neighborhood regulars lets them know you care, creating the basis for a relationship that could last years.
Spas are truly about the experience, so finding creative ways to level-up the service for VIPs without breaking the bank can be a challenge. For timed services, letting a regular know you’re going to throw in a free 15 minutes of massage can go a long way. Or find a way to improve the experience with manicures/pedicures by offering a free coat or passing along manufacturer samples.
Retail clothing and accessories shops have price points that make giving merchandise away to great customers difficult, which is why these outlets should be looking to experiences to reward great customers. Offer guest list to VIP-only fashion shows, personal shoppers/styling, or early/exclusive access to new merchandise.

Whether you’re able to give something away to say “thank you” to your best customers, or you choose to reward them by letting them into the exclusive club of your business, make sure that it’s meaningful.
Awarding your best customers with exclusive perks can help to establish a bond between customer and merchant, where over time they cease to be customers and become ‘friends of the business.’
The little give and take of the relationship between regular and customer creates a familiarity that will ensure that every birthday dinner, anniversary, graduation, and every promotion gets celebrated at your place of business. This is why it’s so important to make sure your best customers know how much you value them each and every time they walk through your door.

news_494,news,How to give your team a winning pep talk to start a new day or shift,"With quit rates approaching 30 percent, business owners need tactics for keeping employees informed and engaged. One simple, no-cost idea is the quick daily meeting. Learn six rules for starting each shift with a boost to performance and morale. 
…",30-04-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-to-give-your-team-a-winning-pep-talk-to-start-a-new-day-or-shift/,"Need a simple way to help staff feel valued and motivated to do their best? Try a quick team meeting every day. Done right, meetings can boost performance and morale—especially important with turnover at a 10-year high.
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 27 percent of employees quit their jobs in 2018. The hospitality industry faces the highest turnover rate, at almost 32 percent. Encouraging employees to stay is far cheaper than replacing people who have bolted.
Daily meetings can keep the team enthusiastic and in the loop. Here are six rules to get you started.
1. Make it snappy.
With a small business to run, sitting around a conference table with bagels and coffee is an impossible dream. People have shifts to get to and tasks to complete.
That means meetings need to run 15 minutes or less, hitting key points and infusing energy into the team. And here’s the catch: Short meetings can actually be harder to run than longer ones.
Come prepared. Most leaders need to write down notes, practice their delivery, and learn to become attuned to the audience. Commit to gathering the team each day and your skills and spontaneity will steadily grow.
2. Set realistic goals.
Everyone wants more customers, better reviews, and bigger profits. But if you throw a lot of lofty goals at the staff, you probably won’t reach them. To get results, the staff needs reasonable goals and a roadmap for reaching them through incremental steps.
Use daily gatherings to focus the team on small goals. Follow up with feedback on how they’re doing and what needs work. Be sure to link all the small changes into the larger picture of how the business is faring—and celebrate each success on the path to excellence.
3. Troubleshoot problems and share ideas.
Doing anything well requires constant evaluation and improvement. Use quick daily meetings to talk about issues and ideas. Are the lines too long? Are customers asking for products you don’t carry? Are special orders coming out of the kitchen too slowly?
Use meetings to gather observations from the staff, roll out better procedures, and introduce new products. You can also use them to brainstorm new specials. For inspiration, check out Clover’s monthly promotions calendar for amusing, off-the-radar holidays.
By keeping employees informed, you let them know they’re valued members of the team. By gathering their input and tapping their ideas, they know you appreciate their professionalism.
4. Ask people to contribute.
As the boss, you set the direction and the tone. But remember, your people are on the frontlines turning that vision into reality. Even the newest hire might have insights to share, while seasoned employees can be reservoirs of knowledge.
Call on people to share their ideas, even the quiet ones on the team. Has the bartender introduced a new cocktail? Ask her to tell everyone how it’s made and what selling points the table staff might use. Do you have an employee who consistently moves more merchandise? Enlist his help in explaining how he does it.
Business owners might even bring in guest speakers to talk about their areas of expertise—analyzing sales data, social media marketing, customer service pro tips, or more. A fresh outside perspective can liven up the meeting.
5. Listen well.
While it’s your job to lead meetings, you don’t want to be the only voice in the room. Instead, listening effectively lets others be heard, promoting them to feel more deeply connected to the business.
So what does listening well really mean? According to a recent survey, the best listeners aren’t just silent. They ask questions that open up a two-way dialogue. Active listening also involves letting the speaker know they’re supported and providing positive feedback.
Of course, leaders shouldn’t let the meeting veer off-topic or become a free-for-all. But even thought tangents or complaints can be channeled in productive directions. Sum up what you’re hearing, focus the team on the day’s agenda, and revisit contentious topics the following day, offering potential solutions.
6. Give targeted praise.
Burnout is a big problem today, with many hourly employees working irregular shifts, taking classes, caring for families, and commuting long distances. People often feel overburdened and underappreciated.
Shower them with praise. For the best results, keep it focused on actual performance. Does an employee always greet customers promptly? Did she do a great job tidying up the stockroom or increasing ticket orders? Let people know you notice and appreciate good work.
In fact, praising employees in a public forum, pointing out their actions and strengths, is far more motivating than doling out vague compliments.
By making short meetings a daily habit, business owners let employees understand what’s happening and what’s expected. More importantly, they create a venue for sharing ideas and expertise, and letting employees know they matter.
With replacement costs equaling 20 percent of a worker’s annual salary, bringing people inside the fold is the best way to keep them there.

A loyalty/rewards program should build long-term loyalty and increase both the total amount customers spend and the number of times they visit.
But is there any proof that’s actually true?
The answer is yes.
A recent study by researchers at Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center looked at the behavior of consumers enrolled in a Canadian air miles reward program. This program had been running for a long time with a standard delayed-gratification model, where customers save up their miles for big rewards. Now the program was beginning to experiment with instant cash-back rewards, and the researchers wanted to know how these different types of rewards affected customer behavior.
Here’s what the researchers learned:

Customers sharply increase spending when they have the chance to earn rewards right away. Customers who opted in to the “Instant Cash” program spent 68% more in the next two weeks than customers who weren’t getting those instant rewards. “Clearly,” the researchers write, “the ability to receive rewards on-the-spot appealed to many consumers and motivated them increase their purchase behavior, so marketers should review their loyalty programs to reward customers at the point of purchase.”
Over the long term, customers who save up for bigger rewards end up spending the most. This rewards program allowed customers to choose how to divide their rewards points between the instant cash back and ‘Dream Rewards’ options. Customers who chose to save up half of their rewards points for a bigger goal ended up spending more than those who took all of their rewards right away.
The opportunity to earn rewards motivates lower-spending customers even more than higher-spending customers. “Increased purchase behavior was strongest for the lowest spending customers and weakest for the highest spending customers,” the researchers write. They note that higher-spending customers may already be close to their “ceiling” for spending with a company, but rewards programs prove to be a great way to turn occasional shoppers into loyal repeat customers.

Ultimately, the study shows that a mix of instant and long-term rewards works to build loyalty and create those dream customers who both increase their spending and keep coming back again and again.
How to Maximize the Impact of Your Clover Rewards Program
How can you get the most bang out of your customer loyalty program? The Spiegel study provides a few smart tips:

Give customers a reward right away. Many merchants launch their Clover Rewards program with a signup special: get a small freebie just for signing up. Immediate gratification doesn’t have to cost much, but if it gives your customers the glow of achievement, it can accelerate their purchase frequency and amounts.
Remind customers that they’re ‘saving’ for a bigger, longer-term reward. Here’s where Clover Rewards mobile offers shine compared to paper punch cards. You may not dig out that wrinkled, torn punch card to check your progress, but a well-timed ping on your mobile phone may prompt you to head back to a store you like but haven’t visited lately. Consider bundling bonus points with a Clover Rewards special offer: you’ll not only drive in-store traffic, you’ll also reignite a customer’s motivation to keep working towards that next reward.
Even less-motivated customers can be goosed into action. Not every customer will be raring to participate in a loyalty program. But if you’ve managed to sign them up at all, you’ve already won. According to the Spiegel study, rewards programs motivate your lower-spending customers even more than those who are already regulars.

news_496,news,Should your business go cashless? Pros & Cons,"Going cashless is not a decision an owner should take lightly. Here we explore the pros and cons of no longer accepting cash, along with the best practices for making such a transition smooth for folks on both sides of the register.…",01-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/should-your-business-go-cashless-pros-cons/,"If you’re a small business owner contemplating going cashless, consider this: An increasing number of Americans no longer use cash in their weekly purchases, according to new research. Today, 29 percent of U.S. Americans have bid farewell to cash, an uptick from 24 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, the cashless store trend has gained attention for the policy’s many advantages: saved time, increased sales, simpler transactions. But the upsides also come with downsides: transaction fees, legislative action, and lost customers. Going cashless is not a decision an owner should take lightly. Here we explore the pros and cons of no longer accepting cash, along with the best practices for making such a transition smooth for folks on both sides of the register.
PROS
1. It saves time
Time is a scarce resource. For merchants racing from task to task, the opportunity to save a significant portion of time would not only give you some breathing room, it could take your business to the next level.
Cash transactions are slower. Going cashless would eliminate the time spent replenishing cash flow, tallying totals and reconciling amounts to ensure proper change was tendered. By eliminating these activities, you now have time to focus on other business tasks and priorities.
2. It increases sales
Cash-related activities lead to slower checkout times and, as a result, reduced volume sold. When all your staff has to do is swivel around a tablet to receive payment, checkout times become faster. If you operate a cafe or fast-casual restaurant, going cashless will keep your lines moving during the morning or lunchtime rush, helping you process more customer sales in a shorter amount of time.
3. It makes work easier for employees
Employees generally love going cashless because it simplifies their work. No more counting coins, replenishing cash, or reconciling totals at the end of the day. Putting all of your transactions on a POS system leaves less room for human error.
4. It encourages higher spending
Customers tend to spend more when they’re not paying with cash. Paying with a credit card or phone is easier; you don’t need to come prepared to a restaurant or shopping excursion with the right amount of cash. It also feels less real. When you pay with cash, you see your money leave your hands. But when you pay with a credit card, the impact is delayed since you won’t be asked to pay your bill for a few weeks. Also, cards with rewards incentivize more spending.
5. It deters theft
Cash is easily stolen. Protecting your cash requires increased security, monitoring and time. Employees facing hard times might dip into the petty cash fund, which owners have on hand to replenish cash registers. Not only is it difficult to track its movement, once cash is gone, there is no way to recoup it. Running a cash business can also make you a target for robberies. For owners, managers, staff and customers, this is no small thing. Going cashless deters thieves and makes your store a more secure place.
CONS
1. It comes with transaction fees
When many merchants consider eliminating cash from their business, they worry about the transaction fees associated with cashless payments. Will the savings in time and the potential increased volume outweigh the increased transaction fees? That’s a legitimate question. After all, with cash, you get the money immediately and you don’t pay a fee. The good news is businesses with higher volume transactions can negotiate lower fees.
2. It excludes certain customers
Going cashless may turn away certain customer segments. If your business serves the older, younger, or low-income people, think twice about this decision, as such a move can exclude customers for whom cash is the only option. For example, if you own a cupcake store, would you want to turn away kids who had saved up to buy themselves a treat? If you own a cafe, are you comfortable excluding homeless people who come in to get a bite to eat with cash in hand? Some owners have faced customer backlash in the form of online complaints and social media boycotts.
3. It is being banned in some places
There are certain places pushing to ban cashless policies. In July 2019, Philadelphia will lead the way by becoming the first major U.S. city to pass a ban on cashless stores, with New York City, D.C. and the state of New Jersey following by considering similar policies. Proponents of these laws say they prevent discrimination against customers who don’t have access a bank account or credit card.
BEST PRACTICES
Use data-centric technology so you can analyze if the transition is worth it. Before making any decision, it’s important to understand your clientele. Your Clover dashboard Transactions tab can give you insight into this. Track the volume and value of transactions that are paid with cash as a percentage of total sales of a month. Look at the patterns of your customers’ cash payments and ask yourself the following questions.

Which demographics pay cash?
Does these clients make up the base of your business?
Do they have alternative forms of payment and could they transition away from cash easily?
Would a cashless policy be seamless or a burden to the majority of your customers?
Can you afford to lose clients? Be real about who you are willing to give up.

Talk to customers. Move beyond the data and talk to customers directly to see if they are ready for such a transition.
Negotiate fees. Make sure the cost savings of going cashless outweighs the increased transaction costs.
Make the transition gradual. Both you staff and customers need time to adjust. During that time, allow for leeway in your policy. That may mean keeping cash on hand or allowing employees to give the occasional freebie to a customer who only has cash. Your goal is to retain customers, and offering such an accommodation will help breed good will and loyalty.
Communicate thoroughly. Make sure your customers get the message and have plenty of time to process it. Post regularly about it over social media. Place signage in the store. Let your customers know at the point of sale.

news_497,news,How top food trucks pick the best spots,"Few businesses depend on location for their success as much as food trucks do. Competition, parking regulations, and customer loyalty all play a role in where a food truck should set up shop. Here’s how to scout out the best place to park your business. …",02-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-top-food-trucks-pick-the-best-spots/,"Food trucks are one of the few businesses where location is absolutely critical to success. For merchants selling meals on wheels, it really is all about location, location, location. While food trucks have the freedom to go wherever hungry customers are, sometimes that’s easier said than done.
Food truck sales can fluctuate wildly depending on a number of factors, most of which are contingent on location. Analysis by CARTO of food trucks in New York City discovered that trucks that set up in the West Village made $5,234 in average revenue per week—while trucks in Corona Park, Queens made $6,128 in average revenue per week. The 10 miles between neighborhoods in the same city can make a nearly $1,000 difference in revenue. In an industry with slim margins, that number can make or break your business.
Where a food truck sets up for the day influences their foot traffic, their competition, their inventory management, and their customer loyalty. Whether you are a brand-new food truck business seeking to build a following, an established food truck looking to expand your fleet, or a restaurant launching a food-truck version of your menu, here are the factors to consider when selecting a location.
Learn about permits, zoning, and parking fees
First and foremost, find out if you’re allowed to park in a certain area. Some cities and towns restrict food trucks to certain zones, or have limits for how long you can park in one place. Chicago, for instance, prohibits food trucks to park within 200 feet of a restaurant. In Washington DC, food trucks are banned from parking before 9:30AM, and may not remain in the same spot for more than two hours (even if they pay at the meter). Those who disobey parking regulations face fees that quickly add up.
Some cities will also require food truck vendors to get certain permits. Of course, as a small business, you will need an EIN and a business license. In addition, food trucks need a vehicle license, a food handler’s permit, a seller’s permit, and fire certificates to operate in certain areas. Check this list for all the zoning and permitting regulations related to your city.
Figure out where the foot traffic is
“Go where the people” are sounds straightforward, but it often isn’t so simple. Head downtown to a financial district and you may find yourself competing with other food trucks for parking and hungry customers. Find space too far away from the lunch crowds and you may lose out on the lunch rush altogether. How do you find the perfect sweet spot where you can capitalize on foot traffic without having to duke it out with other food trucks?
One tool many merchants use is Clover Insights. This app gives business owners actionable insights to manage their food trucks more intelligently. Using Clover Insights, you can see how your business compares to similar businesses in your neighborhood, check out foot traffic patterns in different locations, and more.
There are other key metrics that can give you insight into where to station yourself during lunch. CARTO’s analysis showed that census data, like population, and median rent prices aren’t reliable predictors of sales. Instead, use a tool like like LocationGenius which gives you a good estimate of foot traffic using a mix of cell phone signal and physical sensors. You can also base yourself near a popular attraction and use Google Maps’ live update tool to see when foot traffic dips and peaks throughout the day.
Establish a schedule to boost customer loyalty
It’s difficult to build consistent sales and customer loyalty when a food truck moves to a new location every day. Establishing a regular schedule gives customers the opportunity to plan ahead and anticipate your arrival. It also gives you as a food truck owner some level of risk management; if the new spot you try on Monday’s is a bust, you have four other locations lined up where you can reliably depend on customers to turn up. Having a location schedule can help with inventory management, give you the chance to partner with other truck, and build customer loyalty. Clover Rewards is a good way to reward your regulars and build a long-lasting, profitable customer base no matter where you park.
Partner with special events
Farmer’s markets, festivals, and other events are a great opportunity for new food trucks or restaurants testing a food truck concept to get immediate feedback. Foot traffic at music festivals, sporting events, and seasonal markets is all but guaranteed. Though some events charge steep fees for parking onsite, try to find space leading to and from the venue where you can still catch a lot of foot traffic. If you’re worried about competition from other trucks, start to tease a promo in the days leading up to the event to generate excitement. Clover Promos is a good tool that gives food trucks the ability to send spontaneous promotions to their customers’ phones, driving food traffic in real-time. Launch a promo to get the word out, and see how long it takes you to sell out your whole menu.
Go off-script with your scheduling
Sometimes, the best location isn’t the most obvious one. Many food trucks flock to food truck parks, farmers markets, and business districts. But those who think outside the box may be able to capitalize on a previously untapped market. One entrepreneurial college student in Massachusetts parked his food truck right outside the college bar when it closed at 2AM—and sold out of tacos nearly every Friday and Saturday night. Gas stations can be other unexpectedly lucrative places to set up shop. Here, you can take advantage of workers on the go (think construction workers, law enforcement, or salespeople who travel frequently) who end up purchasing a sad hot dog from the gas station while filling up their tank. Clover Flex is a great way to accept payments at all times—the charge lasts 8 hours, and it even works when you’re offline. No matter whether it’s 2AM outside a nightclub, or 3PM near a rest stop, you can keep on serving up delicious food to hungry people.

…",07-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-before-you-open-a-salon/,"Chances are good that you got into the beauty business because you’re creative and passionate about helping your clients look and feel their best. But when it comes to opening up your own salon, you’ve got to balance that passion with practicality. As with any business, you’re going to need to cover the basics: make a business plan, secure financing, hire employees, and so on. But there are some questions and challenges that are unique to salons. Here are five questions to ask before you open your own salon:
1. Who will your customers be?
Do you have an established set of loyal clients you can bring along to your new venture? Keep in mind that if you have been working at a salon before striking out on your own, your former employer also has an established relationship with your clients. And remember, it’s ultimately the individual client’s decision—even if they like you and your work, they may choose to stick with the salon for a number of reasons, like convenience of location.
2. What sets you apart?
There are more than 1 million salons and spas in the U.S. Why should customers choose you? What makes you different from other salons in the area? Paradoxically, you’ll likely attract more customers by specializing a little bit. Of course, you’ll want to offer a complete range of common services, but think about what you want the brand promise of your salon to be. Are you all about self-care for busy women? Are you all-natural and organic? Think about how every aspect of your salon, from the design of the space, to the stylists and technicians you hire, to the products you sell, reinforces your brand identity.
3. How long will it take you to break even?
A break-even analysis is a great tool for any new business. Crunching the numbers on your expected costs and projected revenue can help you understand how much financing you’ll need to get you through the startup period. In the salon business, pricing is fairly standardized—it will be hard to attract clients if you’re charging significantly more than other salons in the area of common services. So attracting new clients and figuring out how to move retail product is key to hitting your revenue projections.
4. What paperwork do you need?
Like any business, your salon will need a general business license, insurance, and an Employer Identification Number. In addition, to run a salon, you’ll need a cosmetology license. Most, though not all, employees you later hire to work in your salon will also need licenses. Requirements vary by state, so make sure you understand your state’s regulations.
5. What are you looking for in new hires?
As a new salon owner, your first question is, when you’re looking for stylists, are you actually hiring employees, or are you looking for freelancers to partner with? In other words, do you want to operate on a commission or chair-rental model? Either way, you have to think about your style, their style, and the creative fit between the two. Some salon owners find that hiring people with a lot of experience can backfire, if those people have a strong style of their own and aren’t willing to work with your overall vision. When you’re hiring or approaching stylists to rent space in your salon, think about whether you’re looking for artists or pros who always put the customer first.

news_500,news,Win the waiting game: How to keep customers from leaving when tables are full – Part 1,"Want your restaurant’s popularity to last? There is a right and wrong way to keep people waiting during busy times. With insights and advice from top experts, this article covers the best techniques and tools for making sure customers hang in there when your tables are full. 
…",08-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/win-the-waiting-game-how-to-keep-customers-from-leaving-when-tables-are-full-part-1/,"On the one hand, it’s an enviable problem. If your restaurant is operating at capacity with people waiting to get in, business can’t be bad. As a bonus, those lingering crowds or lines are serving as an organic marketing campaign, broadcasting to passersby that you’ve got the right stuff. After all, most folks—frequent diners especially—tend to covet a table that’s hard to get.
Until they’re the ones stuck waiting to get it. (And waiting. And still waiting.)
That’s when the situation can swing the other way for those customers and your business—with more money walking out the door than in, especially with younger diners. They’ve been raised on a level of convenience and rapid consumer gratification entirely inconceivable prior to the digital revolution. And with more competition for their entertainment dollar, they are less likely to live with long waits.
So how do you keep guests hanging in there instead of taking their business elsewhere? What are reliable policies to follow and basic mistakes to avoid? When do you comp drinks or food? What are some helpful tech solutions?
Last but definitely not least: how do you identify and address the inefficiencies causing jammed-up wait times in the first place?
With key insights from leading industry experts, this article will guide you to best practices for better outcomes whenever your tables are full.
First impressions matter.
‘You never get a second chance to make a first impression’ is an adage that carries extra weight in the hospitality business. And the customer’s experience with your restaurant begins well before they take a seat and are handed a menu. Especially if it’s their first visit.
So let’s paint a scene we’ve all experienced…
The energy and atmosphere of a lively crowd hits you upon entering. It’s exciting, enticing. This place is hopping. But it’s also concerning. You can feel the tension of people waiting, an elixir of anxiety and envy. Eyes track your approach to the maitre’d or hostess. Time slows as you prepare to declare yourself and your intentions. Will the seas part for your party? Or will they dash your hopes on the rocks.
Suddenly, you feel the weight of awkward invisibility. The host or hostess is buried in their reservation book or phone. You finally summon the nerve to audibly request the attention your presence has failed to earn when they curtly cut you off at the pass.
“Thirty to forty minutes. Name?”
There goes your appetite.
“That’s the worst wrong answer,” notes leading hospitality consultant and nationally-recognized restaurant expert Beatrice Stein, who does “a lot of training with front-of-the-house staffers around this very issue.”
“You don’t want to lose them. Yes, it’s usually a busy time when all this happens, so reflexively everybody just wants to give the quick, short answer. But it’s really about spending a few minutes and communicating.”
Lead with a positive attitude and options.
With over 18 years of training and development experience, Beatrice has developed a unique brand of “restaurant therapy” focused on sustaining a deeper level of attention to detail in service and customer care for clients including major names like Carmine’s and Virgil’s.
Kindness, a welcoming attitude, a smile—all that matters. But overall, she insists: “The most important thing is to give the customer options. Don’t just say ‘I can add you to the waitlist’.”
Can you start them with appetizers at the bar? Clover Dining facilitates easy pre-authorizations, letting you invite customers to order some drinks and/or snacks while waiting then seamlessly transfer that tab to their table once it’s ready.
If you don’t have those resources, can you recommend something close by to pass the time until you can text or call them, like a nearby wine bar or art gallery?
Even limited options will feel better to a customer than a take-it-or-leave-it binary.
Take a bonding approach before taking their name.
Hand-holding is part of hospitality. And people can tell the difference between authentic and perfunctory attention. Shape the narrative and you shape the relationship. Confide and clarify from the perspective that you’re in this together.
That mindset shift is key: it’s not the customer’s problem and you’re not the gatekeeper. Instead, approach the delay like a shared challenge you’re bonding over.
Even to the point of oversharing.
“I always tell people to be really honest and communicate really clearly, and really well,” Stein explains. Tell the customer their place in line, tell them how things have been moving, tell them that two parties on the waitlist earlier didn’t come, so things could potentially move faster.
“Give them all the information so they understand.” Fundamentally, by giving them your time and attention, you’re communicating that they matter. That you see them. That you appreciate them.
That way, if they don’t wait this night, you’re increasing the odds that they will return another night.
Ask questions and learn how to read the customer.
Of course, communication is a two-way street.
Ideally, the customer will follow your lead in the forthcoming department—letting you know, for example, if they have a movie to catch or a babysitter to relieve. But it doesn’t hurt to ask. Try to have a real conversation in order to make a real connection.
Your positive attitude will hopefully be infectious. But if not, it’s important that you look for and learn to recognize the signs of a customer unwilling or unable to meet you at least halfway for a rendezvous on flexibility island.
You will still want to remain positive and convey a desire to have them as a guest. But every so often, the situation, whether because of circumstantial or personality factors, will have it better to let a customer gently go.

There is a right and wrong way to keep people waiting during busy times. With insights and advice from top experts, this article covers the best techniques and tools for making sure customers hang in there when your tables are full. 
…",09-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/win-the-waiting-game-how-to-keep-customers-from-leaving-when-tables-are-full-part-2/,"In Part 1 of this article, we covered some of the basics of connecting with customers when asking them to wait before service. Today we continue with more solutions to keep your customers happy and loyal.
Leave yourself room to avoid over-promising and under-delivering.
“I always say quote a time range,” says leading hospitality expert Beatrice Stein. “When you give a range for how long you expect a table to be ready, you give yourself flexibility.”
And from experience, Stein has observed that “30 minutes is typically the point where people start to decide whether the wait is too long or not.”
When a customer elects to hang in there for 30 minutes or longer, you really have to honor that leap of faith by committing to continued attention and communication. (A challenge that can fortunately be supported by automated technology these days. More on that further down in this piece.)
To comp or not to comp.
In Stein’s experience with comping, there is no prevailing standard. “Every restaurant does whatever they want.” The only time she thinks it’s absolutely necessary is when a restaurant has clearly missed their mark.
“If you’re running late on a reservation, after fifteen minutes you should be buying them either a drink or sending out something to snack on,” she insists. Given that the customer was offered and confirmed a set time, that’s a clear case of “not following through on your end of the bargain.”
“But with the walk-in-and-quote situation, unless you’re really off your quote, you don’t need to buy anything,” she adds. “That said, if you quoted twenty minutes and now it’s been thirty, you need to buy them something.”
Douglas Robert Brown, author of the seminal and enduring industry best-seller The Restaurant Manager’s Handbook, recognizes that there’s a trend away from comping these days, but finds that policy shortsighted in terms of building customer loyalty. Especially when you’re asking guests to wait.
A specific tactic he recommends is to print branded “dessert vouchers” for managers and/or hosts to give guests. “You can say to the customer, ‘I’m sorry about the wait. It’ll be worth it. And here’s a voucher for complimentary dessert after your meal.’” This approach incentivizes the customer to stay while consuming no time in the moment since nothing has to be prepared and served until later.
Overall, the critical calculation for comping is all about “perceived value versus actual value.”
For example, with many restaurants charging over $10 for a glass of house wine, the perceived value to the customer of a complimentary chardonnay is high, “but what does that glass of wine actually cost the restaurant? Very little.”
And the return in goodwill and customer loyalty will almost invariably be much higher.
Take reservations—and learn from them.
Understand the demand. “Taking reservations is critical to understanding the flow of customers,” Brown insists. “Use a good reservation software application, one that can help you manage the restaurant, where the app shows all the tables and chairs, numbered.”
Clover Dining will cover those bases and then some, including the ability to customize floor plans and create visual table layouts on your screen. By facilitating better communication between your front- and back-of-house, the app also supports orders get fired faster, which will streamline your food service and boost your turn-over rate.
Once walk-in guests have decided to stay despite a delay, the challenge becomes about managing the expectations of your entire waitlist. Time is money on both ends. For your customers’ satisfaction as well as general efficiency, it is critically important to stay seamlessly connected.
Tap technology for managing your waitlist.
Waitlist Me is an easy-to-use waitlist management application for restaurants and other businesses that uses text and phone call notifications to alert customers when it is their turn.
And Beatrice Stein feels strongly that today’s customer prefers being contacted through their phone rather than handheld buzzer devices.
“The phone or text message is more personalized than some beeper you have to hold.” Even better, the Waitlist Me integration for Clover is free and can be used on multiple Clover devices — as well as on iPads, iPhones, Android tablets and phones, and computer browsers.
Another popular, comparable solution Clover offers is Clavo Waitlist. With this Clavo app, you can enter your customer’s information and assign a predefined wait time, setup their mobile number for SMS notification, display a list of all customers along with their current wait time, customize the notifications, and more. You can also integrate Clavo Waitlist with Clavo Tables for a powerful combination of table and waitlist management.
For additional supportive resources, Clover Dining facilitates easy pre-authorizations, so customers can order some drinks and or snacks while they wait to be seated, then transfer the tab seamlessly to their table once it’s ready. It also facilitates seating parties at tables and communications between front- and back-of-house, which means orders get fired faster, streamlining food service generally.
After all, as Douglas Robert Brown emphasizes, “I think the best thing a restaurant can do is try not to get into that situation in the first place.”
Find the inefficiencies slowing down successful experiences and profitable progress.
To that critical end, here’s a primary checklist:

Are you properly staffed for busier periods? (Are you properly staffed period?) You’re not saving money having fewer people on the floor and/or in the kitchen if it means you’re leaving money on the table in the form of lost seatings. 7shifts is a powerful platform for restaurant owners and managers to schedule staff that integrates with your Clover POS to build more successful staff schedules and higher table turns.
Have you provided your staff with sufficient training? Well-organized, ego-free teamwork is the key to grace and speed under high-traffic pressure. Training also builds the sort of confidence that customers can sense and appreciate.
Are checks being dropped fast enough and credit-debit picked up fast enough? Clover Flex is a powerfully agile mobile asset for accelerating service while maintaining accuracy, making tableside ordering and payment nearly effortless.

Then there’s a logistic low-hanging fruit that Douglas Robert Brown says a lot of restaurants are missing. In the years when he was an active consultant, he often advised clients considering complicated solutions for boosting their capacity to “really look at the layout of the restaurant first. Is there a better way to use the space?”
For one example, a country club that sought Brown’s opinion on an expensive dining room expansion was, he noticed, using exceptionally large chairs. Simply by adjusting the floor’s layout around smaller chairs, he was able to add 65 seats “without weeks of renovation costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.”
Once again, popular demand is great. Letting it come between a customer’s positive experience and your bottom line is not.
Winning the Waiting Game 6-step strategy recap:

Take time to connect, communicate, and always give options.
Quote a time range.
Comp to reward patience.
Take reservations and learn from them.
Leverage smart tech for better a better waiting experience.
Identify and address the inefficiencies slowing your service down.

news_504,news,Business scenario: Managing your overhead costs,"Managing your overhead costs can make or break your business. If your fixed costs are too high, you may struggle to make a profit, or find yourself scrambling to make payroll during a slow season. If your fixed costs are low, it’s much easier to ride out a downturn. 
…",16-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-managing-your-overhead-costs/,"Managing your overhead costs can make or break your business. If your fixed costs are too high, you may struggle to make a profit, or find yourself scrambling to make payroll during a slow season. If your fixed costs are low, it’s much easier to ride out a downturn.
So what is overhead, and how do you reduce your overhead costs? Basically, overhead costs are the costs of running your business even if you don’t make any product. Your overhead includes rent, utilities, salaries, insurance, advertising, and any other costs that you have to pay before a single customer walks through your doors. Overhead does not include the cost of raw materials or ingredients that go into your product.
Calculating your overhead costs
The first step to managing overhead is, of course, understanding what your current costs are. If you have a year’s worth of actual expenses to review, start there. Add up the total amount you spent on costs like rent, taxes and licensing fees, advertising, and equipment repair. If you own a building, vehicles, or equipment, include the amount of depreciation you’ve claimed as a business expense on your tax return. Don’t forget extras like cleaning supplies or printer paper that aren’t part of making your product.
If you’re starting a new business and you don’t have your own historical data to use, you can look at public company records to see what typical overhead expenses are in your industry. As you do more research about what your rent, insurance, and other expenses will be, you can refine your calculations.
Overhead as a percentage of sales
Once you know your overhead, you can determine how reasonable those costs are. Most companies look at monthly overhead costs as a percentage of monthly sales, but you can also calculate what your overhead costs per week or even per hour are. The key is to see how your overhead relates to your revenue—basically, you want to see how much of what you’re earning is going to the basic costs of running your business.
Typical overhead ratios will vary significantly from industry to industry. For restaurants, for example, overhead should be about 35% of sales. In retail, typical overhead ratios are more like 20-25%, while professional services firms may have overhead costs as high as 50% of sales. Clover Insights can help you compare your overhead costs to other businesses in your area. For a new business, comparative data like this can help you see what to expect as you build your business, and can provide a reality check if you’re worried that you’re overpaying for a specific expense.
Reducing overhead
If your overhead ratio is high for your industry or your area, you’ll want to look for ways to reduce those fixed costs. Reducing overhead is particularly important in a downturn or a slow season when revenue is low, because these are the bills you have to pay even if you’re not making any money. Of course, you’ll be better off if you can cut costs before you really need to. Keeping your business lean will boost your profits and ensure you’re prepared for good times and bad.
Here are some tips for reducing common overhead costs:

Rent: Can you renegotiate your lease? If you can’t get a rent reduction, see if you can get your landlord to foot the bill for repairs. Fixing drafty windows, for example, could cut your utility bills.
Colocation: Can your business share space with a complementary business? For example, some restaurants rent out their kitchens to catering businesses during off-hours. A retailer might host a pop-up ice cream shop during the summer to draw in foot traffic.
Utilities: Going green can save you money.
Insurance: You should reevaluate your insurance policies every year. You may be able to save money by buying several policies from the same carrier, or installing some simple safety features.
Marketing: Make sure you’re stretching your marketing dollars as far as you can and taking advantage of free promotional opportunities. Word-of-mouth marketing can be a highly effective—and inexpensive—way to promote your business.
Staffing: Look for ways to reduce your staffing costs without actually cutting staff. Make sure you’re scheduling your staff efficiently based on your slow and busy hours.

Get financing in a pinch
If your revenue has dropped suddenly, or you’re experiencing an unexpected slow season, cutting your expenses will help in the long term, but you may also need short-term financing. Consider some fast-cash options like Rapid Deposit, which can get you cash in a day for a simple 1% fee, or Clover Capital, which can give you a cash advance on future credit card sales, so you’re not stuck with a loan you can’t repay.

I’m sure you know, and I’m sure it took you a whole lot less than half a minute to think of it. But do you know why this item is your top-seller? Do you know how to get your other menu items to sell as well as your big money maker? You might have some ideas, but these are trickier questions to answer.
We all have ideas about why products do well and turn a good profit, but to really start boosting your profits you need to get down in the weeds, figure out what’s working, and try to replicate it across the board.
That means looking at customer demand, costs, and pricing. But it also means looking closer at your staff behavior. How do the staff sell your best-sellers? Are they trying to cross-sell or upsell those same customers into complementary products?
There’s often a combination of factors that make your best-selling products a success, and chances are you can take those successes and apply them to your other menu items to see a boost in your profits.
Here are three ways to figure out that winning formula and use it to sell more of all your products.
Calculate the total cost of your high-performer
Work out the exact cost—including the stuff we’d all normally take for granted—that goes into your top-selling products. Shipping costs, storage costs, preparation, time spent—all of this needs to be added up to figure out how much your best-seller actually costs you. You may find that while you sell a ton of this one item, it might actually not be the money maker you thought it was. That’s ok as long as you’re aware of it. Performing this exercise has several concrete benefits:

You may find ways to cut costs (and improve your profits).
You may notice other products that, while they don’t sell as many units, are more profitable and therefore worth another look.
You’ll start to get a sense of what types of things make a product profitable (instead of just a best-seller).

Measure and analyze your results
Once you’ve figured out your costs, you need to take some action. Data collection alone won’t change your restaurant’s profitability, but the actions you take based on that data will. Ask yourself:
1. Can I find a cheaper supplier? Or negotiate better prices on my best-sellers?
2. Is there a way to make the items faster or get customers out the door faster so you can sell more?
3. Does one particular employee sell the heck out of a product? If that’s the case, find out how that employee is presenting the menu item to customers and see how it differs from other employees. You may be able to take that behavior and train your staff to sell menu items the same way, which could lead to higher sales across the board.
4. Are my most valuable customers aware of this product? If your research revealed a sleeper product that brings you high profits, try asking some of your regular customers if they’ve ever tried it. (And if not, why not a free sampler as a thank-you for their loyal patronage?)
5. Would marketing this product bring me more sales? For example, if your soups are extremely profitable, but no one tries them, does it make sense to offer a small cup of soup with every entrée for a month so more people taste your mother’s Minestrone recipe?
6. Are there times of the day when sales are low? If so, are there new markets who could re-energize the sales during these slow periods like early morning construction crews, senior citizens, the after-school crowd, or late-night revelers?
7. Are there times of the day when there’s a lot of foot traffic outside your restaurant, but few people coming in? Would offering a free sample entice more visitors during these periods?
8. What products could be sold together? Is there a natural complement to your most profitable items? Will taking a loss on one by bundling them together lead to higher profits?
9. How can you capitalize on the popularity of best-sellers to spread the word? Can you create a word-of-mouth campaign via social media that would increase sales?
10. Can you sell your best-sellers in a new way that will increase sales, for example on the sidewalk during peak hours, as takeout, or delivery?
11. Can you sell through partners? For example, if your muffins are killer, can you sell to local schools as part of a school breakfast program or to other restaurants/cafes outside of your local area?
12. Can you sell more efficiently? For example, if 10 people in the same office order lunch from you, would offering them a discount to have them ordered (and delivered) at the same time improve your profitability?
13. Do promotions increase sales or just take away from profitability?
14. Are people only buying your best-seller, or are they also buying other items while they’re in your shop? How can you get them to buy more? Would the smell of freshly baked bread or cookies tempt people in line to buy more than just a cup of coffee?
15. Do you have enticing products around the register to promote impulse buys?
16. Does the cashier automatically ask if they want a hot cinnamon bun with icing to go with their coffee? Note that this is more effective than simply asking if they want anything else. The more descriptive (and tempting) the question is, the harder it is to turn down.
Replicate, replicate, replicate
You’re armed with data and you’re ready to act —the next step is to replicate your positive findings throughout your restaurant. This could involve training staff, pairing foods with a particular side dish, making your more profitable items more visible on the menu or changing up your operations. But whatever it is, you’ll want to make sure it’s being done uniformly throughout your restaurant to achieve the best results possible. Want to make this whole process a little easier?

news_507,news,7 best practices to get your business paid on time,"Small businesses lose out on $285 billion every year due to unpaid invoices, causing many to close their doors. Find out how you can avoid this fate with these seven best practices to get your invoices paid on time.
…",22-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/7-best-practices-to-get-your-business-paid-on-time/,"One of the biggest problems that faces any company, large or small, is getting paid. The U.S. Bank reports that 82% of small business failures are due to cash flow problems, while Entrepreneur.com estimates that small businesses in the U.S. are owed a staggering $825 billion in unpaid invoices. Businesses obviously need cash to continue running, but a quick look at the data shows you just can’t count on every invoice being paid, much less being paid on time.
All businesses are subject to patrons skipping out on a bill, fraud, or simple non-payment. The struggle is real for small businesses that send out invoices, which often go ignored for long periods. For these businesses, debt collection is a last resort, but it’s a complicated and expensive process that doesn’t always guarantee results. That’s why many companies decide to write off the loss before it even gets to the point of working with a debt collector.
But why just accept a loss of money you earned for services you provided for a customer? This can cause a domino effect, negatively affecting your cash flow and impacting your ability to make strategic financial plans.
Here are some best practices to help you get paid on time and improve your cash flow.
1. Encourage pre-paying
Don’t want to wait for your money? Get paid up front. Here are a few simple ways to ask for money in advance.

Pay at check-in. Offering a pre-fixe menu? Why not have them pre-pay? With many services like manicures, it just makes sense to pay up front.
Pre-paid cards. Entice customers into buying pre-paid cards for faster service. Or incentivize gift cards…they get $110 for every $100 they put on a gift card. This allows you to get paid before they use it.
Bundle offers. Offer a slight discount for pre-purchasing 10 lunch specials or 10 massages.
Require a deposit. If you’re taking a dinner reservation, catering order, reserving a party at your restaurant or closing your salon to care for a bridal party, there’s no reason not to take a deposit. Even making copies at a copy machine requires a pre-approval deposit on a credit card these days…hop on the trend.
Have them open a tab. Take a credit card and “open a tab” to prevent customers from walking out without paying.
Offer incentives for paying up front. If you’re offering a service that typically would allow a 30 day payment window, offer a 5% discount to customers who pay immediately.
Offer layaway plans. It may sound old fashioned, but a lot of big stores are coming back to this classic offering.

2. Offer simple payment options
You can offer your customers as many different payment options as you’d like, but the bottom line is that you’ll get paid much faster if you have convenient payment options, like paying right at the table. Clover makes it easy to accept payment anywhere, anytime, including cash, checks, swipes, chip cards, and mobile payment. But most importantly, all of these formats are configured in the most convenient way for your customers to ensure that you get paid on time and both you and your customer are satisfied with the process.
3. Avoid cash flow issues
Even if you start getting most of your payments on time, you still have to consider that not all your customers will pay you when it’s due—or at all. If you haven’t budgeted correctly, you may not have money available for payroll, taxes, or operating costs. This is why you need to keep a tight control on your cash flow and identify any areas that could cause problems if you don’t get paid on time. Anticipating these issues can go a long way to helping you operate in lean times and get away from a “paycheck-to-paycheck” mentality that hampers many small businesses.
Also consider getting a loan to cover short-term cash flow issues. Clover Capital helps merchants get working capital to grow and enables them to easily pay their loan back. Learn more about making the most out of your future credit card sales and rapidly growing your business.
4. Get paid faster
Worried about cash flow and want to get your money faster? Rapid Deposit is a new Clover product that allows merchants to get their funds receivable within minutes—24/7, weekends and holidays—for small, 1% fee. Read more about Rapid Deposit and how you can start getting your money faster.

5. Spell out your cancelation fees and penalties
Your bill should not include any surprises, and that includes any fees or penalties you want to assess. All of these fees should be clearly spelled out in the initial discussions with your client. For example, if you charge a cancelation or no-show fee, explain that when you take a reservation and take their credit card information. If you provide services, include this information in your contracts and on the invoice itself. Customers will be a lot less likely to give you repeat business, or in some cases even pay, if they feel they were taken advantage of by “hidden fees.”
6. Stay on top of billing
The businesses that get paid on time keep their accounts payable organized and held to a strict schedule. While everyone has a system that works for them, you need to be sure that your system does what you need—and what you need is to get paid. Keep track of all your open invoices and have a schedule of when reminders get sent out so you don’t let too much time go between the sale and payment. For example, if you’re running a pub and typically have patrons stay for long periods of time, have them settle up every few hours or at the end of the happy hour period. Don’t let it go too long or they may forget what they ordered.
7. Deliver clear bills
Your customers will be a lot less likely to pay an invoice if they don’t understand it. While you may not want to go in very fine detail on your invoices, you should make them clear to understand and difficult to argue with. Depending on your business, you’ll want to list the items they purchased. If you own a service business, you’ll want to itemize services performed, how much time was spent on each service, and how much each service costs individually.
BONUS: Understand your customers and the issues they may pose
There’s no formula to follow for this bonus best practice—it relies on you knowing as much about your customer as possible and the potential pitfalls that may arise when you bill them. If you have regulars who like to run up a bill until payday, stay in tune with their pay cycle…and don’t let them get too far ahead of their ability to pay.
Some customers are prompt in paying their bills, others are not. Some expect itemized invoices, while others will take a general bill. Many customers accept invoices sent over email, but some still want a hardcopy. By understanding your customers’ habits, you put yourself in a strong position to make sure you paid. While this process can’t be easily automated and will take some manual administrative work to get going, you’ll find that this tailored approach brings you the money you need, when you need it.

news_508,news,Merchant talkback: What’s your biggest business challenge and how are you handling it?,"Wondering how neighboring business get through their biggest challenges? Here’s how they’re overcoming some of the most common small business obstacles.
…",23-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/merchant-talkback-whats-your-biggest-business-challenge-and-how-are-you-handling-it/,"How can merchants take on the challenges of owning a small business—staffing problems, cash flow issues, getting their name in front of customers—and still get ahead? We asked them what their biggest challenges were and how they were tackling them. Here’s what they said.
Problem: Getting (and keeping) the right employees
“Staffing is a challenge,” says Andy Mullins, head of Nobletree Coffee. A company growing quickly needs to stay proactive.”
And the battle isn’t over once you’ve landed the right candidate—in fact, you could say it’s just begun. Employee retention is a problem for many small businesses, but there are also opportunities to turn perceived weaknesses into strengths.
Solution: Nate Masterson, an HR manager for natural beauty product firm Maple Holistics, said that larger companies have “so many people doing your job,” which creates more competition when roles become available. Smaller firms present a different playing field, Masterson said, because “if you’re good at what you do and show talent and skill, you’ll be given new responsibilities [and] taught new skills and groomed, making you that much more valuable to the market.”
Emphasizing the opportunities for growth, being part of the community, and the passion for what they do helps small businesses stand out as wonderful places to work.
Problem: Managing your cash flow
Most owners start their businesses because they have a passion for what they do. Hair stylists love beauty, barkeeps open pubs to build community, and chefs open restaurants because they love to cook. But rarely does anyone open a business because they love business.
When business or finance isn’t a business owner’s first language, they can struggle to succeed. “I really wish I would have understood business better when I started rather than just having industry-specific knowledge,” says Dennis Gullo, a spa owner in New Jersey. “I was an education junkie but only in the salon business.”
Philip Campbell, a CPA and former chief financial officer in several companies, says “poor cash-flow management is causing more business failures today than ever before.”
Solution: It can be tough to track money coming in and going out of a business. This is why business owners should turn to new technology like Clover Rapid Deposit, which allows merchants to get their funds receivable next-day and frees them up to do what they do best.
But not all cash flow problems are related to a lack of know-how. In fact, some issues are caused by experiencing too much success. “Growing your business puts a huge strain on cash,” Campbell said, also stating that you often have to make investments long before you’re able to see a return on that money. Whether it’s investing in inventory or opening a new location, business growth requires money up front.
Again, working with new technology may be the key to overcoming this problem. Clover Capital allows small business owners to get working capital through a loan to help expand their businesses, then repay that loan through future credit card sales.

Problem: Finding (and using) the right technology
Keeping up with new technology—or the feeling of having to keep up with new technology—can be a difficult struggle for small business owners.
Justin & Brie Henshaw, owners of Fuse Frozen Yogurt, discovered first-hand that robust is not always best when it comes to business technology. “We used to have a very in-depth, very complicated, very expensive [point-of-sale] system that we used to use, and I wanted to find a better way,” said Justin.
Solution: The Henshaw’s discovered that enterprise-scale technology that has all the bells and whistles is probably not the best choice to serve a small business’ needs. Instead, they opted for a Clover POS system, which allowed them to focus on the features that truly made a difference in their business, which in turn allowed them to focus on other areas of the business. That simplification was what allowed their business to grow.
Problem: Getting the word out
Some small businesses struggle with how to stand out in the crowd. They don’t always have the budget for national, or even regional ad campaigns like their bigger contemporaries, so they must turn to different marketing and branding sources.
Solution: Tower Paddle Boards and Beardbrand are two small businesses that both turned to digital content marketing as they worked to gain market share. “Figure out what people are searching on and provide that content,” said Stephan Aarstol of Tower. “It’s as simple as what questions are people asking and answer those questions and answer them well.”
“If you want to create a brand, you have to provide value to the life of the consumer beyond just the products,” added Eric Bandholz of Beardbrand. “So much of that is the content, whether it be education or entertainment.”
Other ways small businesses can market their brands is by offering unique customer experiences that set them apart from big-box stores. “People’s palates have become more sophisticated, with the Food Network and foodie culture,” says Daniel Sterling, the CEO of Seattle donut startup FROST. “We try to make coming to FROST a fun experience for everyone that comes in.”
FROST rotated flavors several times per week shortly after they opened to see which donuts sold the most. As time went on, that variety and novelty became a part of their brand. Sterling said that the unique flavors are “the number one reason people come to FROST. People are used to getting interesting products from us, not your typical things.”
Problem: Minimum wage hikes
One of the biggest challenges small business owners face is the rising minimum wage which is seen in progressive cities and states throughout the country. While these rising wages are theoretically good for workers, they present several problems for small business owners, not the least of which the fact that many report cutting hours or staff due to the higher wages.
“It’s not like I’m taking home so much that I can take it out of my pocket,” Alli O’Neill, owner of a bakery in New Jersey says. “I wish I could. I think there are big businesses out there that can do that. But the small businesses can’t.”
Solution: Some companies, like Protein for Pets, look to replace workers with automated and outsourced technology as they grow, eliminating the problem wage hikes present. “We are actively planning for an increase over the next three years,” says Marco Giannini, the CEO of Protein for Pets. “Companies should look to outsourcing more technology and services.” Small businesses can now look to apps that integrate with the Clover POS that can handle scheduling and accounting concerns, which frees the owners to hire more customer-facing employees, which in turn will help the business grow.
Other small businesses are looking outside the box for incentives that could take the place of rising wages. “If the rise in minimum wage had a ripple effect that ended up pushing our hourly employees to ask for more money,” said Andrew Schiller, the CEO of Location. He suggests promoting peripheral benefits employees can access: “flexibility in scheduling, frequent free lunches, casual environment and more.”
Problem: Customers abusing return policies
A constant problem for any business is returns, however enterprise-level businesses can eat the cost of a return a lot easier than a small business. That’s why small business owners must decide on the right return policy for them and their customers.
For Vladimir Gendelman, the founder and CEO of Printwand, a custom printing and promotional-item business, it’s important to keep the return and refund policies simple. “Customers do not want to jump through hoops if something doesn’t work out for them,” says Gendelman.
Solution: The customer experience drives return policies for other small businesses as well, albeit in different ways. While your official policy may be 30 days or to charge a restocking fee, that might not be the best way to go according to Brad Schweig of Sunnyland Patio Furniture. “In practice, we’ll take things back pretty much whenever as long as it is sellable and current. It is not worth the bad vibe with the customer to play games with the return policy, and it provides peace of mind with them if they don’t like their selection.”
Others, though, take a completely different tack when it comes to returns. Magnolia Emporium, a curated home decor, gift, art, and gourmet shop does not have a return policy. “We actually solved that [problem of designing a good return policy] by not offering any returns. [We] have tried many options over the last several decades and this is the only thing that works correctly.”
Whatever your return or refund policy is, it’s important to make sure your customers are aware of it to avoid any confusion. For some, this means hanging up signs around their cash registers with their policies clearly written out. Magnolia Emporium, on the other hand, has their Clover POS system print their return policy right on the customer’s receipt.
Whatever challenges your small business faces right now, there are solutions out there to help overcome them and turn your business into a success.

This year’s highlights suggest restauranteurs are focusing on personalization, innovative products to meet evolving customer tastes and desires, and improving operational efficiency. Let’s take a spin.
We loved the Ripple Beverage Printer, which brings “signature drinks” to a whole new level. This product can print anything from logos to selfies on beverages ranging from beer and cocktails to cappuccino.

Standout new products we tasted included Trident Seafood’s protein noodles. This “pasta” checks all the right boxes for the modern consumer: it’s low in carbs, high in protein, low-fat, sustainable and tastes great.
We couldn’t get enough of Jimmy Dean’s new Stuffed Sausage & Gravy Hash Browns. Think giant, stuffed tater-tots – so good, so crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and so portable. Yum!

Operational efficiency was perhaps the most pervasive trend in the 2019 NRA show. Restauranteurs are keen to optimize operations in every corner of their business – from the hostess stand upfront to sparkling-clean restrooms in back.
Starting in the kitchen, H-eats Lava Gel, promises to revolutionize catering and large-scale events when kitchens struggle to prepare a big meal without overcooking it. Flame-free heat from this handy gel keeps food warm and service-ready for two hours after leaving the kitchen.

Bear Robotics promises to improve guest experience and the bottom line at restaurants with an automated food runner. Similar to a Roomba, these robots use AI to navigate a busy floor carrying food and drinks to tables. It even busses the dirty dishes after the meal.

The Giddel Toilet Cleaning Robot is self-explanatory. Who wouldn’t want it to do your restaurant’s dirtiest work?

Allied to this efficiency theme was a greater emphasis on digitization – ditching paper-and-pen in favor of integrated digital systems accessible anywhere, a concept Clover understands very well.
We talked to many restaurant owners about the value of automation to reduce labor, enable smarter decisions and delight the guest – goals we saw repeatedly addressed across the show floor. We’re excited to get back to Clover and keep helping merchants realize their goals.

news_510,news,4 cash flow management strategies for bars,"For bar owners, managing cash flow is key to keeping the business afloat. These strategies and tools can help merchants understand the inner workings of their business, plan accordingly, plug cash leaks and save money daily. 
…",29-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/4-cash-flow-management-strategies-for-bars/,"Owning a bar comes with a lot of responsibilities. You’re managing staff, inventory, expenses, and more, all while trying to keep the party vibes going. It’s a lot to handle, and the failure rate is high. One key to making a vibrant space succeed in the long term: managing cash flow.
What is cash flow? It’s simply the movement of money in and out of your bar. As any good business owner knows, you want more green coming in than out. Accomplishing that requires a solid grasp of the inner workings of your business and using the right tools to keep the reins tight.
For many owners, the non-stop demands of running a bar leave little time for analyzing business activity in a meaningful way. Things slip through the cracks. Mistakes at the cash register. Expired inventory. These small errors add up, and when you’re operating on razor-thin margins, this could mean the difference between keeping the good times going and shutting your doors for good.
Read on for strategies to keep your bar’s cash flow management in tip top shape.
1. Know your business.
Having a solid grasp on your business’ daily ebb and flow—from a bird’s eye view all the way down to the nitty gritty—is crucial for every bar owner. Here’s how.
Maintain a daily business review, which is simply a record of each day’s business activities. Consider this your bar’s financial Instagram. You can scroll back in time to see a snapshot of your business at any point, use the data to spot trends in sales and anticipate future demand. Overtime you can analyze customer flow, seasonal activity and payroll costs, giving you the insight to plan for the future. Let’s say customer traffic surged last summer because of the draw of your popular beer garden and you were short staffed. Now you know to hire a few extra hands once the weather warms up. Or if a certain menu item isn’t selling well, it may be worth nixing it for something more popular and profitable.
Clover apps such as Insights and Cash Log will help you see the big picture and zero in on the details of where your cash is going.
Check in on your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These measurements help you monitor your business’ financial health. Start with these nine numbers to quickly assess where things stand — and where things need to improve. When it comes to evaluating your cash flow situation, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio is your friend. It simply measures cash in against cash out by dividing your net operating income (EBITDA, or “earnings before interest taxes, depreciation, and amortization”) by your yearly debt payments.
DSCR = EBITDA / Annual Debt Payments
This would come in handy if you were considering taking out a loan. If you calculated a DSCR of 1, you’re breaking even and not in the best position to borrow money. A DSCR of more than 1 means that there’s more cash flowing in than out; the higher the number, the better situated you are to meet upcoming loan payments.
2. Know how to plan.
There are the regular expenses you can easily predict—rent, for example—and then there are the surprises, like when the air conditioner dies in the middle of the summer. To protect your cash flow, you need to plan for both.
When you budget for upcoming expenses like rent, utilities, payroll, inventory, and so on, your business is prepared for this regular outflow of cash and you know this money is already tied up. You know the minimum cash you need coming in to cover these expenses. A savings club is an annual savings tool that automatically collects funds every day and returns them to you in December to cover year-end expenses. There’s also Sweep and Save, which takes a percentage of daily sales and gives it back to you the first of the month to cover monthly expenses.
Of course, you’ll need much more if you want to turn a profit and have the extra financial cushion to cover unexpected problems. Here are ways you can plan ahead to curb overspending and bring in more cash.
Manage your staff to ensure you have just the right amount of workers on hand. When you over staff, everyone loses. Your payroll expenses go up and your staff makes less on tips. Of course, when you under staff, customer turnover takes longer, hurting sales, and you end the day with a burnt-out staff. Lean on your daily business reviews from the past so you have a better sense of customer demand and the times of the year that require staff adjustments.
Pay cash upfront if it helps you save money. Many beverage and food distributors offer a discount to clients who pay right away. If prompt payments translate to trimmed costs, these savings will add up over time and give a boost to your cash flow.
Plan ahead for surprises. When you set small amounts aside regularly, you eventually save a lump sum that can cover surprise costs, like replacing the air conditioner, which ultimately protects your cash flow.
Create a gift card program. Not only does this encourage customer loyalty and offer another way to patronize your bar, but it helps you lock in customer payments upfront. And getting cash in the door quickly is a key factor in the cash flow management game, especially in the bar industry where cash flow is tight.
In the spirit of speeding up the inflow of cash, consolidating your financial activity with one bank cuts down on processing time and gets money deposited into your account faster. Another way to hasten cash your way is to adjust your official day end time. Clover’s default closing time is 1:00 a.m. for merchants, but if you close up even a few hours before that, you could be looking at a faster turnaround of when the money reaches your account. Reach out to Clover support if you want to make any adjustments.
Tighten up your invoice system. Say you rent your bar as an event space or provide another service that requires invoicing. If you want your funds fast, make it easy for clients to pay you. Create an invoicing schedule so you invoice on time, make sure you have correct customer contact names and addresses, provide clear explanations of charges, clearly define late payment terms and offer simple payment options.
Borrow wisely. If your bar needs a loan and is in a good position to borrow money, you’ll need to carefully consider your options. Bank loans are cheaper, but the application process takes longer. Clover Capital can get cash in your hands in as little as 3-5 business days. The model is rather innovative: Clover Capital can automatically withhold a small percentage of your daily credit card sales to repay your cash advance.
Get your funds faster. Any merchant knows that if you have a big day of sales one day, it take a while for that money to find its way to your account. With Clover Rapid Deposit, you can access your funds faster, whenever you need them. You can get your funds receivable as fast as the next day, which can come in handy if you are short on cash and payroll is due, or another big-ticket expense is looming.
3. Know how cash is being handled…and mishandled.
Taking a deep look at the movement of your cash can help you uncover leaks in the system. Unfortunately, these problems can crop up at various places throughout a business, sometimes by mistake, sometimes as theft. Fortunately, a variety of tools can help you find and fix these issues swiftly.
Monitor in real time the cash out to employees or registers with Cash Track. When a shift end, you can reconcile an employee’s final tally to yours, which can highlight any irregularities. The app provides daily shift reports and can also help calculate tips. This app, along with Ping Me If, will send alerts when certain events happen, such as when an order is deleted, a payment, refund, tip, or discount exceeds a specified amount, and more.
Track your inventory closely. As a bar owner, you know how easy (and expensive) alcohol theft can be. Using the Clover POS inventory tracking system can help you stop this behavior in its tracks. Bottle Keeper helps you track your liquid stock to address waste, theft and basic inventory management.
4. Know how to save money daily.
Since stemming the flow of outbound money is your ultimate goal, it’s important to identify ways to save money daily along different points of the process.
Going green helps you build savings into your everyday operations. When it’s time to buy or upgrade appliances, invest in energy efficient products. Even smaller changes such as installing LED light bulbs and low-flow faucets can cut your expenses.
DAVO Sales Tax automatically sets aside your sales tax on a daily basis, then files and pays it in full when it’s due. This saves you from encountering unexpected tax bills or late fees.
Update your menu. When you keep an unpopular drink or dish on the menu, it cuts into your profits. Get rid of items that don’t sell and replace them with something crowd pleasing.
Don’t let your perishables go to waste. Tossing inventory is like flushing cash down the toilet. Stay on top of things with Recipe Keeper, which tracks what you have on hand for your menu items and monitors your stock as you sell. This helps you reduce waste.

news_511,news,Happy hour overhaul: Rethinking your drink special (Part 1),"Ready to upgrade your Happy Hour? We asked top-shelf industry experts to serve up their latest insights and tips for drawing new customers, delighting regulars, and driving sales. Learn what trends are working right now, and how to translate them to your bar or restaurant. …",30-05-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/happy-hour-overhaul-rethinking-your-drink-special-part-1/,"The Happy Hour concept sells itself. As Tony Abou-Ganim, author of The Modern Mixologist: Contemporary Classic Cocktails, sums up: “Happy Hour is a great way to expand your clientele by getting them to experience your bar or restaurant at a reduced cost to them.” A win-win for consumers and proprietors alike.
The challenge is selling your Happy Hour.
How can that venerable tradition be successfully refreshed for your bar or restaurant? To learn more, we tapped some top-shelf industry experts, experienced both behind the bar and with boosting the bottom line, for a look at today’s best trends. Read on for our first 5 tips, and be sure to check out Part 2 of this article next week for 5 more.
1. Start with a goal, then work backwards to target your audience.
Experts agree that your Happy Hour strategy should always begin with a primary business objective.
Are you a restaurant aiming to draw the after-work drinks crowd and have them stay for dinner? Are you a new venue trying to attract a specific clientele? Are you an established bar trying to improve a slow weeknight or stimulate greater sales from your regulars?
Identifying that main goal should steer your focus to a target audience: the accessible customer segment most likely to deliver those results. Maybe it’s upscale professionals. Maybe it’s college students on a budget. That target audience might vary significantly depending on the day or night of the week, or even the time of year in some cases. (For example, a pub could have a college-heavy crowd September through May then need to pivot to a more family- and vacationer-oriented clientele for the summer months.)
One steadfast principle to live by: “Know your neighborhood,” advises Sam Barron, co-owner of the award-winning bars The Emerson and Suzume in Brooklyn.
Like politics, all Happy Hours are local. And hosting a successful one is fundamentally a community-building proposition.
2. More than a good deal, a Happy Hour has to deliver a great experience.
So how do you stand out and get noticed in your neighborhood?
Overall, it’s fair to say that a few standard drink specials are probably not special enough for today’s consumer—particularly millennials who, research shows, spend more time going out, and a larger percentage of their disposable income doing so, than any other demographic.
Think of Happy Hours like the trailer for a movie. The idea is to give the customer a tightly-edited but exciting taste of the bigger picture that is your bar or restaurant’s brand, a taste designed to leave them wanting more.
Elements that are unique and compelling about your place should be distilled into crafting a unique and compelling Happy Hour. As much as possible, aim to inject the personality and values of your place into the effort. Consider the very definition of special: “better, greater, or otherwise different from what is usual.” Well, if you survey the competition, discounting a few drinks is probably as common as it gets, and even less exciting.
So let’s sample some fresh trends worth making your own.
3. Get seasonal to save money and build buzz.
Abou-Ganim, a three-time Iron Chef America winner who currently operates his own beverage consulting firm for bar staff training, product education, and cocktail development, isn’t a fan of the standard 2-for-1 model.
Anything that might encourage “binge drinking as a way to build business” isn’t going to be worth it in the long-run, he feels. (Not to mention, in some parts of the country having 2-for-1 drink specials, or “stacking” drinks, is illegal. Consult your local Liquor Authority for applicable regulations.)
Instead, the renowned cocktail veteran recommends promoting quality over quantity, suggesting a standout opportunity for taking a seasonal approach to designing Happy Hour drink specials that’s still economically sensible.
“I love to work with the chef on ingredients,” he explains. “By sharing seasonal ingredients with the kitchen we can run special seasonal cocktails and utilize ingredients the chef may also be featuring, saving on waste.”
Then, for even more savings, he advocates incorporating dead stock (product taking over six months to deplete) into those featured seasonal Happy Hour drinks.
Crafting a unique cocktail experience that changes with the seasons, he contends, will ultimately yield a better, more lasting form of buzz. “Give your regular clientele another reason to experience something different at your establishment and make it a draw for them to share with friends.”
And that sharing should include social media—so plan to make hashtags an extra ingredient.
4. Try translating an old European tradition to today’s taste.
Particularly with young millennials and discriminating professionals, lighter and low-proof cocktails matched with complimentary small bites is a hot Happy Hour trend that CBL Liquid Consulting’s Claire Bertin-Lang refers to as “Aperitif Hour.”
The James Beard Award-winning online magazine PUNCH credits the phenomenon to “worldly, taste-making bartenders who have made it a point to expand upon the concept of the aperitif in ways consumers can access and enjoy”:
In structure, “the aperitif is pretty straightforward, honest and clean,” says Alex Day, David’s partner at Nitecap, who owns several other bars around the country. As such, it’s the ideal canvas for like-minded bartenders to “articulate happy hour in a more adult manner” by subtly shifting the emphasis away from draining glasses toward appreciating who you’re with, shepherded by what you’re sipping.
Call it the smart sips-and-nips approach. And those complimentary small bites can be translated far beyond the high end. Ever eaten a few French fries before dinner and not suddenly needed a whole order? Serve five piping-hot fries on a small plate with toothpicks and a dollop of chipotle ketchup or some aïoli mayo gratis and voilà—a more savory beer-and-shot special people will crave.
Another relatively low-cost idea that consistently wins big in driving thirst: organic popcorn with just a dash of truffle oil.
5. Mini-size them and deliver more with less.
Travelling the country for events and consulting projects, Bertin-Lang, who started behind the bar at 19 and now also serves as the Beverage Director for Eat Drink SF, has also noticed a lot of venues finding Happy Hour success with smaller versions of popular drinks—“like at Dante in NYC, with their $5 mini-martini”—and appetizer portions of “food items that management is hoping to showcase so people will later want to order full portions at full price.”
Another less-is-more trend that Claire sees working well these days is “the spirit-specific happy hour.” In Los Angeles, for example, hotspot Harvard & Stone does $6 one-ounce pours of any Mezcal they carry, including Del Maguey Pechuga, every day from when they open at 8pm until 9:30pm.
For even more examples of successful Happy Hour approaches, leading industry publication Nightclub & Bar has compiled this inspiring list.
Be sure to read Part 2 of this series to learn 5 more steps to making sure your happy hour stands out from the crowd.

Last week we published our first 5 tips in Part 1 of this article, and today we’ve got 5 more to keep you thinking.
6. Pack a creative punch—then pair it with oysters or other premium appetizer specials.
Having previously been illegal, Happy Hours are still pretty new to the Chicago area, notes Liz Pearce, owner and operator of acclaimed cocktail lounge The Drifter, located in a former basement speakeasy. (Illinois’ 25-year ban ended in 2015.) And unlike other parts of the country where she’s worked, Chicago still has a lingering aversion to 2-for-1 drink specials, which means that food rules the hour.
“Around here the main the trend I’m seeing is a focus on specials like cheap oysters, pintxos, and things like that,” says Pearce. The most interesting Happy Hour drink trend she’s noticed locally is offering “a cheap punch deal. Broken Shaker always has a punch of the day.”
Given that, in drinking culture overall, Pearce sees popular tastes shifting towards lighter drinks and more adventurous flavors, a good punch can cover both bases—and even better, it’s easy to serve a large volume quickly.
One solid strategy would be incorporating the seasonal ingredients approach into fun, inventive punch options paired with small bites—ideally along a theme. Change things up to keep people interested in sampling what’s new.
Even better if you can add some wit and creativity to naming each punch. Again, think social media and make hashtags an extra ingredient.
7. Think outside the after-work box: Happy Hour can be any hour (or hours).
One of the best ways to stand out from the local competition is to break the mold. Today, more bars and restaurants are extending the boundaries of what a Happy Hour can be, and when it can occur.
Late night is a prime target.
Research conducted by the National Restaurant Association found more than 50% of consumers under 35 make numerous late-night restaurant visits monthly while only about 25% of older consumers are that active. Additionally, “41 percent of consumers aged 21-34” report that drink specials “are very important to their decision” when it comes to patronizing a late-night restaurant.
8. Measuring Happy Hour success is not an exact science.
One critical question that planning successful Happy Hours invites is how to evaluate the economics. For example, is it ever worth taking a loss?
In her experience spanning dive bars to high-end cocktail lounges, Liz Pearce has encountered a range of Happy Hour approaches and mindsets. “It really depends on the kind of business owner you are, and how you arrange your budget.”
“I have definitely worked for people who said they needed to make their margins on everything, every time. But I’ve also worked for people who viewed it more as marketing dollars in order to bring people in.”
“Personally, I fall somewhere in between,” Pearce explains. “To make your numbers, I find that small snacks during Happy Hour will lead people to drink more full priced drinks or menu items later on.”
Take a more holistic approach to Happy Hours. Are they achieving that macro objective? You might not see your return on a Monday night Happy Hour until Sunday brunch, for example, but the “trailer” principle is about converting drop-ins to regulars by highling the best of your brand.
Says Pearce: “I guess it’s less of a practical science, and more of a social science.”
9. Maximize your entertainment value.
Truly impactful Happy Hours, as previously noted, deliver a great experience. Essentially, you’re hosting a party—and doing so should naturally include creating an entertaining atmosphere.
Start with your target audience then reverse-engineer the best music and lighting to support the atmosphere that suits their preferences. Remember: Happy Hours are always a work in progress. You’re trying to build an audience week after week, and should always be adjusting and experimenting, listening and observing, refining your formula.
Technology now also allows you to make the music experience interactive with digital jukebox platforms like Rockbot. Designed with bars in mind, their service includes Rockbot Request, letting “you create an experience that keeps people in the bar longer and makes them want to tell their friends about you.”
Sam Barron has noticed a lot bars having success by incorporating trivia contests, bingo, board games, and shuffleboard into their Happy Hours—tactics that really engage as well as entertain customers. “Happy Hour is when the conversation happen,” he explains. “You’re mixing the regular booze hounds with the after-work crowd, so it’s great to have activities that people can connect around.”
That said, the tactic isn’t as simple or easy as just buying a few games. As with any other customer-touching aspect of your business, it needs to be thoughtfully managed into an experience.
10. Shift slow nights into the fast lane by outsourcing the fun to experts.
Broadly Entertaining, headed up by Giana DeGeiso and Jamie Rosler, serves a range of private and corporate clients, offering them over three decades of combined experience in performance, hosting, and event management. And one their leading specialties has become “bar entertainment”.
Working with multiple independent bars, DeGeiso and Rosler have developed a loyal following for their signature “Drunken Jenga” nights among similarly whimsical, humor-driven takes on bingo and trivia contests, all hosted by an experienced team of performers adept at working a crowd—and building one over time.
One inherent advantage to working with an experienced independent events company is that you immediately benefit from their marketing resources. Also, while you may be fortunate to already have staff who are natural entertainers, it’s likely better if your employees can focus on serving while your events team manages the entertainment side of engaging guests.
Many bars these days hire Broadly Entertaining to “grab that Happy Hour crowd and extend it for longer,” explains DeGeiso. Sizing up works best for the challenge “varies from bar to bar, and from neighborhood to neighborhood,” Rosler emphasizes. “Every client has different needs.” But the key factor is atmosphere.
“It’s about facilitating a hang with an atmosphere you want to be in,” explains DeGeiso. “And you get that from people, from relationships, so it’s important that your staff is also having a good time to foster that welcoming vibe. If your staff isn’t happy to be there, your customers won’t be either.”
Find an events team with bar experience to help you turn a consistently slow time into a destination time for a desired audience. Just make sure you shop around for an entertainment sensibility that suits your brand.
And, as with anything else, evaluate what works, listen to your customers, and calibrate accordingly.
“With Broadly Entertaining, you get all the materials needed for an event along with professional entertainers as the hosts,” says DeGeiso, highlighting the value of people adept at working a room. “Our team features experienced actors, stand-up comics, and improvisers who know how to be on a microphone and entertain a group effectively.”
The bottoms-up bottom line:
Surprise. Delight. Refine. Repeat.
And remember, as The Emerson’s Sam Barron emphatically declares: “Happy Hour works. Forever and always.”
Here’s wishing you many Happy Hour returns.

How can restaurants compete for more guests? By creating an unbeatable in-restaurant experience. Here are four tips that can help.…",04-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-how-to-make-an-unbeatable-in-restaurant-experience/,"In this digital era of IWWIWWIWI (I want what I want when I want it), one of the toughest challenges restaurant owners face is pulling guests off their phones, through the restaurant doors, and up to a table—and then getting them to do it again and again. Today, consumers have more options than ever for dining in, take out, on-the-go ordering, and at-your-door delivery, so how can restaurants compete? By creating an unbeatable in-restaurant experience.
Experience drives the numbers
More companies are realizing that providing standout service and a memorable experience makes great business sense. In fact, this AmEx survey reports that seven in 10 U.S. consumers say they’ve spent more money with businesses that deliver great service. And in a textual analysis of almost 332,000 online restaurant reviews for 1,300+ restaurant locations, “service” was the keyword mentioned most.
What’s more, it turns out that just one negative experience can have a significant impact on business. NewVoiceMedia reported that businesses lost $75+ billion in 2018 due to poor customer service—a $13 billion increase since 2016. On the flip side, this report suggests that even a moderate increase in customer experience can generate a revenue increase, averaging a gain of up to $775 million over 3 years for companies with $1 billion in annual revenues.
Realistically, most restaurants don’t generate $1 billion annually in revenue, but this principle holds true: improving the customer’s experience, even a little, can mean more in-restaurant guests and an increase to the bottom line.
What guests want
This restaurant customer experience survey found that guests want five things from restaurants: to engage, empower, hear, delight, and know them. But how can restaurants forge a meaningful customer experience? They can start with four simple ideas that offer guests what they want and create an engaging experience that keeps them coming back.

Embrace your brand story and make guests a part of it. To stand out in a crowd of restaurants, figure out what makes your brand story unique, and share it with guests. Make them a part of it. Not sure how? Check out these tips on how to create a compelling brand story and design your front-of-house for a customer experience that reflects your brand.
Know your customers by listening. How can you know what guests are thinking? By listening. Listen to guests as they express requests, needs, and challenges, and address them quickly to create memorable experiences that bring guests back. Take time to get to know your best customers. Learn what they like and what they don’t. And take time to learn their names. In fact, one survey reported that their names and their favorite drinks are among the most important things diners say they want restaurants to know and remember. Hospitality, attentiveness, and anticipation are basal ingredients to creating a locale guests want to patron. Remember, too, that your staff are your front-line listeners, so hire well, teach them strong customer service skills, and train them to listen to guests. Make sure your front- and back-of-house are communicating effectively. For a bit of a refresher, peruse these six ideas for standout customer service.
Create a mood and environment that delights. The places we choose to return to create an atmosphere, evoke a mood, or conjure memories that we like and want to live with while there. Restaurants are places where aesthetics matter. From the murals on the walls, the furniture in the room, or the dishes cradling delicacies, each specific touch generates an environment that can attract or detract customers. What’s one of the most significant detractors? Dirt. Maybe you’ve been in a diner somewhere where the food was good, but the seats were torn, the windowsills sprinkled with dried food, and a weird stain lurked on the carpet. If you chose not to return, you’re not alone. 75% of U.S. consumers said they won’t patronize a restaurant with negative reviews about its cleanliness. Conversely, cleanliness, complimentary extras, and offering seating preferences go a long way to increase the number of repeat guests. For more inspiration, see how these restaurants create unique experiences.
Be socially engaging. Think food critics alone determine whether guests visit your restaurant? Think again. As early as 2015, more people reported turning to consumer reviews on sites like OpenTable, Yelp, and TripAdvisor than relying on reviews by professional food critics, and 60+% read guest reviews before going out for a meal. One Harvard Business School researcher even found that a one-star increase in a restaurant’s Yelp rating led to a 5-9% increase in revenue. Since 100M+ visitors turn to Yelp for information, ratings, and reviews on businesses of all kinds, especially restaurants, it’s important to make time to manage online reviews—reviews that can make or break a reputation. Fortunately, Yelp for Business Owners makes it easy to connect with guests, respond to reviews and complaints, and manage your Yelp page to help garner great Yelp reviews. Not convinced it’s important to manage online complaints? Check out this infographic to understand more about who complains, why, and how to embrace complaints.

As restaurateur and tech company co-founder David Joseph shared: “A restaurateur once said to me, ‘The most expensive seat in a restaurant is the empty one, because it’s costing you’.”
How can restaurants fill empty seats? By creating an in-restaurant experience that gives guests what they want—a culinary experience that’s simply unforgettable.

news_514,news,How smart restaurants deal with rising labor costs,"Hourly wages in the restaurant industry are on the rise. For merchants already running a tight profit margin, it can be tricky to balance higher wages with the increased burden on your budget. Here’s how smart restaurant owners are navigating this challenge.…",05-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-smart-restaurants-deal-with-rising-labor-costs/,"Good news for the economy: hourly wages are up by more than 3% for the ninth straight month, according to the US Department of Labor. And, in the restaurant industry, job growth is booming.
Wage growth and employment following the 2008 recession have been slow to recover. The restaurant industry is one of the few sectors where more workers are getting hired, as well as taking home bigger paychecks. According to Federal data, “restaurants added 317,700 jobs over the past year, and the industry now employs nearly 12.2 million people. The 2.7% increase in industry jobs is higher than the 1.7% increase for the broader economy.”
Higher hourly wages and more workers are both good things. Restaurant industry employees are some of the hardest working people out there—they deserve so much more than minimum wage. But, in an industry where the profit margins are notoriously tight, higher wages can make running a small business more complicated. Many restaurant owners report that labor costs are already accounting for 25% – 35% of their overall operating budget.
How can you continue to support your team with fair wages while still running a profitable business? Here’s what some restaurants are doing to deal with rising labor costs.
Increase efficiency with technology
IT solutions, like smart-POS systems, can help a restaurant increase efficiency, thereby increasing revenue. More revenue means a healthier profit margin, and therefore less stress over rising labor costs. Plus, labor efficiencies allow restaurant owners to shift investment into service-oriented tasks that customers can appreciate.
Integrate apps into your Clover POS system to streamline your business and give you an edge over your competition. Try one (or all!) of these restaurant apps to get started:

MarketMan: this app gives you the ability to track the cost of goods sold, monitor inventory in real time, and place orders to suppliers at the touch of a button. It helps teams to manage inventory and re-stock precisely when needed, resulting in less waste and saving time and money.
Time Clock by Homebase: stay ahead of the lunch rush by giving your staff the ability to swap shifts, get reminders before shifts, and more. When you need help quick, send a message out through the app offering bonus shifts for available staffers.
Commerce Sync: save your managers time by automatically syncing daily sales from your Clover POS with accounting software like Xero and Quickbooks. The app has saved customers an average of 300 hours per year!
SimpleOrder: this real-time inventory management app shows you low performing menu items, giving you the chance to replace them with better dishes (and save money in the process).
BottleKeeper: input your cocktail recipes, as well as your starting inventory, and let the app track how much is left in each bottle. Get insight into how quickly your components are consumed and order ingredients at the right time.

None of these apps will replace the great customer service your team brings to the table (pun definitely intended). However, along with your POS dashboard, these tools can supercharge your operational efficiency and make sure all the restaurant’s moving parts synchronize perfectly.
Check your ingredient costs regularly
Food costs are on the rise. According to a 2018 report, food costs increased by 7.7% over the last two years. For many restaurants, more than 30% of the operating budget goes toward purchasing food and beverage ingredients. If your labor costs and food costs are starting to compete, the better option is to revisit your ingredients to find out where you’ve gone astray. Variances due to inconsistent portions, theft, or market price fluctuations are much easier to resolve than having to fire a great team member.
Experts recommend keeping a close eye on the costs supporting your menu, starting with your most-used kitchen and bar ingredients. You should also go through this actual cost v. ideal cost exercise to make sure your prices, portions, and other factors are giving you the best profitability possible.
Personalize your guest experience
Cities across the US are raising the minimum wage for hourly workers. Some restaurants have even begun to do away with tipping, instead paying servers a higher salary to close the wage gap between the front and back of house. Whether you choose to raise the hourly wage to meet a city’s minimum requirement, or if you wish to go gratuity-free, it’s still important to empower your servers to deliver a great customer experience. Without diners, there can be no servers.
Restaurants win by providing personalized service to each and every customer. Smart tools, like Clover’s POS system, can keep track of guests’ allergies or other preferences. Keep track of customer behavior, order history, and personal details like their birthday or anniversary. Each time a customer returns, your team has a new opportunity to surprise and delight your guests. All this data can help your servers make better tips, and keep loyal customers coming back for seconds and thirds.
Decrease staff turnover
One of the biggest labor costs, outside of payroll, is staff turnover. The turnover rate in the restaurant business is over 70%; Gallup estimates the average cost of turnover per manager for restaurants to be $13,867. It takes a fair amount of time to find, hire, and train a new team member—especially at this moment of record unemployment. Industry data collected in 2018 found that three-quarters of restaurants experienced more difficulty recruiting hourly employees than in years past.
Once you find great staff, make them want to stick around by building a great work environment, offering more long-term career prospects, and breaking down barriers between the front and back-of-house. Explore some of the ways communication can improve the server and kitchen experience with this free webinar. Proactively empower your staff to do their jobs well, and they’ll stay engaged—and employed—for much longer.
Decide if delivery is worth it
Some restaurant owners turn to delivery or takeaway as a potential separate revenue stream with lower overhead. The thought behind this? Delivery may have a higher profit margin, as labor costs, such as server time, aren’t relevant. Delivery apps like Foodora and GrubHub can bring in new customers, provide marketing support, and do the work of getting food from you to the customer. By some projections, food delivery in the US could reach $200 billion in sales over the next four years. It’s an enticing prospect for restaurants looking to add revenue.
However, there are some costs associated with delivery that may outweigh the benefits. Packaging costs can quickly add up, and service fees on these apps can reach over 30% of final customer checks, eating into your profit margin. Before diving into the world of delivery, check out some of these Clover-integrating apps and analyze your business numbers to see if the investment is worthwhile.

news_515,news,The quick & dirty guide to SEO for your small business,"You need to be visible online to get more customers. That all starts with a strong “SEO” strategy to truly start growing and differentiate from your competitors. Learn what you need to get started in this quick and dirty guide to SEO for your small business.
…",06-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/the-quick-dirty-guide-to-seo-for-your-small-business/,"When you started out running your business, you probably conducted as much guerilla marketing as you could—stuff like social media posts to drum up interest or old fashioned word-of-mouth campaigns. While you probably put up a website too, you may not have given it much thought, but a really strong website is crucial to attracting new customers and convincing them to stop by your storefront. The key to that is search engine optimization (SEO). The better your “SEO,” the more easily new customers will find you.
It’s a fact: if your business is going to succeed, you need to be online. Not only do 72 percent of people prefer to find information about local business through an internet search, but a staggering 98 percent of those web searchers will choose a business that appears on the first page of their Google search.
In the world of SEO, content is king
Above all else, Google ranks relevant content as the most important factor for a good SEO score. In years past, companies used to game the system by writing for search engines—this meant cramming a bunch of keywords into a blog post as many times as possible to rank highly for those keywords. It would look like this:
“When choosing a hardware store in Los Angeles, you need to know what makes one Los Angeles hardware store different from other Los Angeles hardware stores.”
Thankfully, Google recognized this practice and made a shift towards favoring readability and helpfulness over keyword cramming. This means instead of thinking like a search engine, you need to think like your customers, and provide answers to the questions they’re asking.
Clover Insights can be really helpful in this area, since it gives you a clear idea of your customers’ preferences and buying patterns. You can use this insight to create blog posts and hone your website content to ensure you’re putting out the information your potential customers want to know about.
For example, if you run a hardware store, you might see that power drills are big sellers. You can then write a few different blog posts on the topic, like “Choosing the right power drill,” “5 things you should know when buying a power drill,” or “When is it time to replace my power drill?” This type of content answers the questions your customers search for and can help you rank higher in the search engines.
Get the link juice flowing
One more consideration that impacts your SEO ranking is link authority—in other words, the amount of websites that link back to your site and your blog posts. Think of this like your reputation. If a lot of other quality websites trust your content, then that means Google is more likely to trust your content as well. When a website with a high ranking, like the New York Times or other news sites, cites a link to one of your posts in an article, then your link authority will go up. These are called backlinks, and when you start linking back and forth between websites it gets the link juice flowing.
Great backlinks for your store can come from setting up a Google My Business page, from local directory listings, local papers (who review your store), or from social media and review sites. You can also get backlinks to your blog posts or other killer content.
It’s pretty difficult to game this system. You’re only getting a link to another website if you put out quality content that they find valuable. You’re not going to see spammy, keyword-loaded blog posts linked in a news article—it’s going to be a post that provides useful information and comes from a place of authority.
The back of your house must be in order
Unfortunately, great content and a lot of backlinks aren’t going to be worth anything if you don’t have the right engine to promote them. Your website design needs to be optimized for your SEO content, otherwise it will just go nowhere. Your metadata, description tags, content headers, and even images all need to be aligned to get the most SEO value out of your content.
For instance, we know Google can’t quite tell (yet) if the image you chose for your post goes along with your content or not. Using the accessibility features like alt text can help. Alt text is a small caption to the backend of your post that describes the image. If you don’t have alt text on the images on your website and blog posts, you’re missing a big opportunity to help your SEO rankings.
While getting your website’s backend into order may seem like a daunting task, you don’t have to be a computer hacker to figure it out. There are a lot of resources out there for you to find—coincidentally, by performing a Google search like “how to get your website seo in order”—that will help answer your questions and give you the tools you need to get SEO working for your business. There are also plugins (like Yoast) and even tools on Clover’s app marketplace like Build Me a Website.

How do you know if, when, and how to take your show off the road? What are the right questions? Where are the best answers found? What can experienced food truck veterans turned successful restaurateurs tell us?
Drawn from an excellent range of sources, the following stockpile of information is ready to guide the way.
Road-tested brands can be built upon
One point made clear in recent years is that stepping up from a truck to a restaurant need not be an either/or proposition.
After launching with a single vehicle, some of the most successful food truck entrepreneurs now operate mini empires of trucks and brick-and-mortar locations, finding great promotional synergy in the combination. What they fine-tuned in a mobile lab now works well enough to have customers waiting when they open a restaurant. Meanwhile, the trucks keep performing and boosting their brand’s profile.

6 reasons to start a food truck before opening a restaurant

Thanks in part to some game-changing social media promotion, Chef Roy Choi and his Los Angeles hybrid of Korean-style meat served in Mexican tacos is frequently credited with putting the food truck phenomenon on the culinary-cool map back in 2008. From a single Kogi Korean BBQ truck launched that November, his operation has grown to four trucks, plus a full catering operation, a taqueria, a bar (Alibi Room), and a sister restaurant (Chego!) that specializes in rice bowls.
In and around Boston, The Chicken and Rice Guys have expanded their popular halal offerings from a single truck in 2012 to three restaurants and at least as many trucks, plus a thriving catering business. One bottom-line reason they keep their trucks running: profitability, with truck-based margins at 20%-25% compared with 8%-12% for their restaurants.
As for when to consider the move, long lines are obviously a good sign. Needing more kitchen space to meet demand is another. Here’s some advice from a few who have timed their expansion well:

A critical ingredient: location, location, location
The golden rule of real estate is even more indispensable when it comes to launching a viable restaurant—especially a new concept from a first-time owner. If you’re thinking about making the investment or raising the capital for a brick-and-mortar spot, the importance of finding the right location and negotiating a favorable lease simply cannot be overstated.
Some would even argue that until the perfect location at the right price is within your sights, your keys should remain in the ignition.
One great way for testing out a locale: park your food truck there, or close by, and sample the setting.

Key pros, cons, and contrasts between the streets and a street address
Industry experts agree that a food truck is a smart way to test out and introduce a dining concept and brand. If you have created a successful food truck, you’ve accomplished a lot. The odds your venture had to overcome are formidable, and the costs, while lower than with a restaurant, are still substantial.

A detailed look at restaurant vs. food truck start up costs

Beyond the financial investment, there are numerous challenges to translating your food truck’s unique alchemy to a sit-down experience. There are operational logistics including customer service and staffing issues. Some aspects of the learning curve will necessitate trial and error, but knowing more about what to expect and what to avoid will fortify your game plan considerably.

Whipping up a new food business? Here’s the dish on going mobile vs. starting a brick and mortar restaurant
The main difference between food trucks and sit-down restaurants

Diversify to transcend trends and consumer whims
Last year, Matt Coen, CEO of Off the Grid, who works with hundreds of food trucks in the Bay Area, released a “Mobile Food Trends Report” that found immigrants, women, and LGBTQ entrepreneurs own food trucks in surprising numbers. This diversity is a win for the economy, and definitely a win for consumers.
While there’s no doubt that food trucks have been a great entryway into the food and beverage business—particularly in the wake of 2008’s recession—success has also brought intensified competition. Accordingly, it’s a good idea for food truck owners to protect their business gains by diversifying into brick-and-mortar locations, as well as into catering and events if possible.
Ultimately, when it comes to any new direction, your customers will be the best guides. Stay focused on where their preferences lead you—and take inspiration from how far you can travel.

These great restaurants started as food trucks

Leverage your leg up
At the end of the day, starting a new restaurant comes with a pile of headaches along with the opportunities. But if you have a successful food truck, you’ll already have experience crafting your product and connecting with your customers. With greater space, however, comes greater responsibility. Managing staff, larger inventory, and more bills can take a lot out of anyone.

news_517,news,Crowd pleasers: Make “Kids Eat Free” work for your restaurant,"Kids-eat-free is seductive, family-forward, and a no-brainer for parents. Making it work for restaurants isn’t easy. With a few tips and tools, restaurants can introduce a children-eat-free policy that’s attractive to families, manageable for staff, and profitable. …",12-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-make-kids-eat-free-work-for-your-restaurant/,"“Free is magic,” as one psychology professor said. It’s seductive. It’s family-forward. It’s a no-brainer, for parents, anyway. What work-weary, wallet-conscious parent wouldn’t drift into a restaurant that offers to feed their kids—for free—just for buying a meal?
But making freebies work efficiently and effectively for restaurants isn’t easy. Do parents have to purchase two or more entrees to qualify? What if they share an entrée? Which menu items are eligible? How can restaurants make sure they’re not cheapening their product? How can they keep ingredient costs in check? All importantly, how can they track whether the “freebie” policy is actually paying off?
With a few tips and the right tools, restaurants can introduce a children-eat-free policy that’s attractive to families, manageable for their staff, and profitable. Here are 5 tips to manage free meals.
1. Make it special.
Create a special event for your freebie. Make it a limited-time offer for a day, week, or a month. This can serve to try it out before instituting it as a permanent policy. Or, you could consider offering it a specific day of the week, like these restaurants, or during specific business hours—think your slow times—to pull in more foot traffic. Even American diner franchise IHOP tested kids-eat-free meals during specific hours on specific days of specific seasons.
2. Keep it simple and social.
All things being equal, keep the freebie simple. Take the story of 110 Grill in Rochester, New Hampshire, for example. An upscale New England restaurant group, 110 Grill decided to lean into the local Rochester, NH market, ripe with schools and children, and set a goal to pull more families through the doors. They started by introducing a simple meal policy for a month: for every adult entrée purchased, a family could have a free child’s meal. How did they market the promo? Through Facebook, garnering over 30k views that month. The result? Sales ticked up a few thousand dollars per week and they saw more families with children visiting the grill.
3. Do it family style.
Two challenges of offering freebies, discounts, and promos are managing coupons (and coupon clippers) and possibly devaluing your product. One way to side-step both is to offer family-style meals. For parents, these kinds of meals can take the stress out of ordering individual meals for picky young palettes and help them minimize wasted food that little eaters may leave behind. Another upside? Family-style meals just might encourage the no-kid diner to order an extra dish, side, or even an entire meal to take home for the next day. And if you do decide you’d like to try your hand at coupons, be sure to check out Clover’s free app, Promos.
4. Experiment creatively.
Making kids-eat-free work for your restaurant means experimenting. One marketing principle to keep in mind? Test and learn creatively. Experiment to see what offering creates the greatest yield for the restaurant. If it fails, try another offer, try another day, or try a completely different idea. By testing and learning, you may uncover some golden nuggets—and yummy morsels—that your guests love and that pull in more foot traffic than you anticipated. For testing and learning, it pays to get creative with food promos.
5. Pick a tool.
One of the toughest parts of running a kitchen is staying on top of the inventory—how much inventory to stock, product to make, or when to make it—especially if you’re giving product away. That’s where Clover Insights can help. A tracking and inventory app, Insights gathers intel on what’s selling, what’s being ordered for free, and when. And it’s the only tool that pulls back the curtain on the competition—the dollars and customers they’re bringing in. What’s even better? The Service Plan is free, and Insights Standard is only $9.99 a month. Or, take these tools for a spin to help manage inventory:

MarketMan is a cloud-based inventory management and purchasing tool that streamlines procurement, delivery, and accounting for food and beverage businesses.
Recipe Keeper tracks on-hand stock for various dishes or recipes.
Bottle Keeper helps you determine exactly how much liquid stock you have on-hand.

Then check out this read on why focusing on kids can increase profits and how to appeal to the traveling parent. And if you need help tracking data or inventory to make a child-friendly policy work, visit Clover’s App Market for a wealth of apps that work with your Clover POS device and make inventory tracking easier.

news_518,news,5 questions to ask before working a wedding,"In 2018, the average wedding in the U.S. cost $44,000. Weddings can be lucrative—and stressful. Bridezillas aside, here’s how to determine whether your small business should say yes to working a wedding. …",13-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-before-working-a-wedding/,"In 2018, the average wedding in the U.S. cost $44,000, according to Brides.com. The wedding industry is a nearly $60 billion market, and small business vendors often play an integral role in orchestrating every fairytale ending.
Weddings can be a lucrative market for florists, caterers, event planners, venue managers, photographers, and bands. But, these events come with a lot of pressure and high expectations. The stakes are high—and the many moving parts and demanding couples can lead to stress and expense on the part of small business owners. So, what should merchants know before they say “I do?” to working a wedding? Ask these five questions before saying yes to the dress.
1. Is your wedding agreement ironclad?
The biggest mission when it comes to working a wedding is getting the agreement in place to protect you from disaster. It goes without saying, but get everything in writing, including and especially any modifications to your original agreement. Good contracts will be specific, detailed, and protect all parties involved. Include these sections:

Cost of services
Description of services
Deposit, final payment, and the payment schedule
Add-on fees, including travel and out-of-pocket expenses
Authority for contingency plans and substitutions that may affect the cost
Cancellation at the client’s or vendor’s request, as well as a contingency for unforeseen circumstances (like a health issue or extreme weather)
Clauses specifically for: amendment of the agreement, limitation of liability, governing law, and indemnification
Intellectual property

Be very precise in your description of services. For example, florists and brides might have different definitions of what constitutes delivery of “white flowers.” A merchant may assume something like baby’s breath; meanwhile, the bride is envisioning white lilies. Attach images, sketches, or link to specific Pinterest posts to make sure everyone is on the same page!
2. What are the timeline limitations?
The fact that many couples begin to plan their wedding up to two years in advance does not actually make the entire process less stressful for you, the vendor. A longer lead time can increase the chance that the client ghosts you, or that there will need to be changes to the original contract (again, get them in writing!). Statistics show that couples with a two-year engagement might spend a year looking for the perfect vendor, so it’s not personal if someone bails after the initial pitch.
Likewise, the opposite issue can be true: there’s too little time for you to properly prepare for the wedding demands. Due to the seasonal nature of weddings, vendors may often be asked to do a ton of work in a short space. Make sure you have the time available to handle the requests. For florists and caterers, this should include thinking about what will be possible. Some flowers may not be in bloom, or some ingredients may not be in season. Consider the timeline and the time of year carefully when designing the scope of work.
3. Is there a contractor you can partner with?
Some small businesses resist working weddings because of the burden the event places on the rest of their operations. Florists, caterers, and event planners can take advantage of independent contractors to outsource some of the on-site tasks of running the event. A contractor might be a good fit to handle consultations, wedding marketing, pre-wedding day prep, logistics and ordering of supplies, setting up on the day, or managing staff schedules. Think of them as a dedicated resource to keep an eye on the wedding while you handle the rest of your business.
4. What flexibility is there?
Inevitably, something will change as the couple gets closer to the wedding date. It could be the number of guests, it could be that the wedding gets moved inside, or it could be something bigger. Determine ahead of time where there is flexibility: what is the absolute budget limit? What are the “nice to have” services that the couple is willing to compromise on, versus the “must have” items? There are often many cooks in the kitchen when it comes to planning weddings. Getting the couple’s hard and fast limits when others are coming to you with ideas or changes can help you stick to the contract and ensure happy clients.
5. How will a wedding impact your cash flow?
For event planners especially, managing cash flow can be one of the most complicated parts of putting on a wedding. From payroll and supplier agreements to floral arrangements and caterers, there are a lot of moving parts with separate payment schedules and deadlines. Plus, budgets are notoriously tight when it comes to planning a wedding. If you go over the agreed amount, that means money out of pocket for your business. Don’t let a wedding drain your operating budget: plan a payment schedule that allows for efficient budgeting ahead of time and adds a cushion for overages or changes. Use a POS-integration like Reporting to automatically track day-to-day payments received, discounts given, and taxes paid. Likewise, Cash Log is a free app that tracks cash transactions, including all cash drawer activities such as adding or removing bills and coins.

news_521,news,3 reasons vape shops fail & how to avoid them,"Opening up a vape shop could be your golden ticket, since the industry is expected to reach $61B by 2025. Learn how to navigate all the potential pitfalls so your vape shop becomes a success.
…",20-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/3-reasons-vape-shops-fail-how-to-avoid-them/,"Thinking about opening up a vape shop? You might be onto something. Nearly 5% of the U.S. population vapes, which accounts for about 10.8 million people, while a third of those vape daily. Additionally, some experts expect the vaping and e-cigarette industry to grow to more than $61 billion in the next decade as more and more people switch to this alternative to traditional cigarettes.
However, just like any business, there are certain pitfalls you need to avoid if you’re planning on opening a vape shop in the near future. Here are three reasons why vape shops typically close down shortly after they open, and what you can do to give your vaping business a healthy head start.
1. There’s not enough capital.
Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as just hanging up your shingle and selling vape products. Opening your own store could cost anywhere from $25,000 to $100,000, depending on whether or not you franchise, and there are always additional costs along the way. When you become a franchisee for a big vape company, you’re typically set up with everything you need to open your business, including licenses, inventory, and operating systems. Independent stores need to acquire all of that by themselves but can do so on their own terms.
Either way, there are a number of costs you should take into account when planning to start your new business. Rent for your store, accounting costs, marketing materials, point of sale (POS) systems, and training for your employees are necessary costs no matter what business you’re starting. The costs specific to your vape shop should include inventory like:

E-Cigarettes
E-liquids
Batteries
Battery chargers
Vape juice
Replacement coils

All of these costs can add up quickly, and let’s face it: most people don’t have a hundred grand—or even a quarter of that amount—lying around in a bank account. Small business loans are usually the way to go when starting up a new business, which is where a service like Clover Capital comes in. This innovative program allows you to turn future credit card sales into the capital you need to get started, which eliminates a lot of the headaches you’d normally run into with a traditional small business loan.
2. The local laws are unfriendly.
Local vape shop regulations can put a serious damper on your vape shop plans. States like California and Indiana are creating regulation after regulation regarding vaping and vape shops, so you should definitely do some research about your state’s stance on vaping—as well as the city or locale in which you intend to open your vape shop. Here are a few things you should keep in mind when navigating the tricky world of vaping regulations:

What kind of license is required to operate? Some locales require special use permits, while others consider vape shops the same as tobacco shops.
What are the zoning laws in your area? While you may plan to operate your shop in a business district zone, you could run into issues if it’s too close to a church or school.
Do you have to charge any special taxes? Some cities impose “sin” or “nuisance” taxes on things like tobacco and alcohol—and yes, e-cigarettes.
Are you able to sell cannabis? While still a federal offense, the sale of cannabis has been legalized in a number of states. This could be a lucrative item for your business but could also open up a lot of legal concerns.

In certain cases, you may need to get involved with your city council regarding vaping regulations. Your best opportunity is at a public meeting, so it’s important to make a great first impression—especially for those who may not have the most positive opinion about vaping. Come prepared, professional, and ready to make a valid argument in favor of your position on vaping.
3. Good employees are hard to find.
Businesses live or die by their staff, and this is doubly true for highly regulated industries like vaping. Not only does your staff have to be knowledgeable about your products, they also need to be dedicated to following the rules, like never, ever selling to minors—even it means checking the ID of every person who walks through the door, no matter how old they appear. There’s always someone watching, and one wrong move could cost you a ton of money in fines or worse, get your business shut down.
In addition to knowing and following the rules, your employees need the ability to speak about your products with every type of customer that walks through your door, from a first timer to the experienced aficionado. They should also do this in a friendly, yet professional manner, which requires a level of training to get right. Gusto is a Clover app that handles employee management, which includes everything from payroll and HR tasks to training and gathering feedback. Automating these employee management tasks can free you up to make sure your employees are equipped with everything they need to make your business a success.

news_522,news,5 things you can learn from Small Business Revolution,The online reality show Small Business Revolution - Main Street takes a look at the impact small businesses have on the community around them. Here are 5 lessons small business owners can learn from Small Business Revolution.…,25-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-things-you-can-learn-from-small-business-revolution/,"From Kitchen Confidential to Shark Tank to Silicon Valley, there’s no shortage of TV shows that focus on the hustle and struggle of entrepreneurs trying to make a small business work. The online reality show Small Business Revolution – Main Street takes a look at the impact small businesses have on the community around them. Each season, marketing and business experts visit one small town and work with six businesses to help make them more profitable—and hopefully, revitalize a whole town in the process. Read on for 5 lessons small business owners can learn from Small Business Revolution.
1. You have to invest in marketing.
Too often, marketing is the last thing on the list for busy business owners—but a business can’t survive without advertising. The marketing experts on the show typically start by creating a strong visual identity for the business. It may be worth working with a designer to create a modern logo as a starting place for your branding and marketing efforts.
2. A clean, inviting website is crucial to attracting new customers.
Many small businesses on the show haven’t claimed their listings on Google or Yelp, let alone set up their own mobile-friendly website. But you want your business to show up when people are searching for “restaurant” or “dog groomer,” so new customers can find you. The show’s experts often recommend using original photos that highlight your space, your products, or your customers. So you’re not duplicating work, set your website up to automatically draw in content from your social media feeds. If this all sounds overwhelming, don’t panic—there are plenty of tools available today to help you create an attractive and functional website.
3. There may be money hidden in your inventory data.
Good inventory management is crucial to running a successful business. But business owners on Small Business Revolution often confess they’re too busy to dig deep into the numbers—and many don’t really understand what those numbers are telling them. From the family restaurant whose cost of goods was way too high to the beauty supply store where 20% of the inventory just sat on the shelves, never selling, the experts on the show help many business owners improve profitability just by taking a closer look at their inventory data. A modern POS system should make it easy to find and understand data on what’s working—and what isn’t.
4. Don’t be embarrassed if you’re not confident about your money-management skills.
“I try to do a budget every week, but it goes out the window, because I have to buy more products.”
“Pricing is really a scary thing for us, because this is our only income, so we don’t want to price ourselves out of the market.”
“I have no clue how much money I make.”
Any of this sound familiar? The business owners on Small Business Revolution get really honest about how they sometimes struggle to even understand, let alone manage, their business budgets. If you relate to these struggles, the most important thing is to know that you’re not alone. But you do need to get a handle on this side of your business, or, like one struggling business owner on the show, you’ll be saying, “I don’t know if I’ll ever breathe easy.” The good news is, there are lots of resources out there to help you.
5. Know that you deserve to make a good living.
The business owners profiled on Small Business Revolution are passionate about what they do. But as one entrepreneur says, dog grooming “is fun, but it’s not my hobby.” Most small business owners work long hours, and many feel they can’t ever take a vacation. When their business struggles, many entrepreneurs on the show stop taking a salary for themselves. But these behaviors aren’t sustainable. Burnout is a real risk for small business owners. You deserve to pay yourself a good salary, take vacations, and save for retirement. Building a business that’s strong enough to support you in a healthy work-life balance starts is an achievable goal, and it starts with going back to the fundamentals: making a budget, managing your inventory, and marketing your business.

news_523,news,Enterprise behavior: How to increase ticket size at your restaurant,"Any successful restaurant owner knows that, in order to thrive, they need to keep their eyes on the bottom line. Here are some strategies on how to increase sales in your restaurant.
…",26-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-how-to-increase-ticket-size-at-your-restaurant/,"Any successful restaurant owner knows that, in order to thrive, they need to keep their eyes on the bottom line. One of the most important techniques for boosting profits is to increase the average order amount per customer. Every additional item they tag to the order—from a $1 upcharge for brown rice to an expensive bottle of wine—increases the ticket size and expands a restaurant’s margins. So how do you enhance the customer experience, train your staff and design your restaurant to drive bigger ticket sizes? Read on for strategies.
Dig into the data.
Start by crunching the numbers. Calculate your average sale. Let’s say on a typical day you bring in $1,000 from 40 customers. That means your average sale is $25. From here, you can determine a realistic goal—perhaps an average of $30 per customer over the next quarter—and make a concrete strategy to reach it.
Your Clover data will help you better understand customer behavior. For example, if you see a sales slump mid-week, experiment with a promotion on those days to see if that lifts sales. If your lunchtime crowd spends less per order, try increasing the average ticket price at your restaurant by offering a pre-fixe meal, group specials, ready-made lunches to go or create partnerships with local businesses to cater to their staff.
Your data analysis will also point to when your business performs the strongest. Capitalize on seasonal trends and other times when sales are on the rise. Plan ahead, cross-promote with other merchants, get micro-influencers to spread the word, reward your most loyal customers and run a targeted marketing campaign to make the most of those boom times.
Add premium products to the mix.
Offer higher-priced items to your menu, or the option to upgrade dishes with premium ingredients, and watch your bottom line grow. The latest research shows that, as customer eating habits change, they’re more inclined to fork over more cash for something better.
About a third of consumers say they are ordering healthy items more now than they were two years ago, according to Technomic’s Healthy Eating report. Health-conscious customers are more inclined toward menu items marked as natural, low in additives like sugar or salt, and boasting of ingredients that offer health benefits, such as high-fiber foods or probiotics. The report also shows that 40 percent of older millennials “consider health very important in their decision of which restaurant to visit,” and that about one third of respondents were willing to pay more for foods that are low sodium, low cholesterol, or contain superfoods.
In addition to healthy options, premium products such as specialty wines, craft beers, imported cheeses, branded goods, or even an entirely separate premium menu can entice diners to splurge.
Design your space to enhance the customer experience.
Happy customers tend to spend more, so stay tuned into what turns your customers on. When guests make reservations online, you gain a ton of insight into what they like and don’t like. For example, customers can specify their seating preferences; if the data reveals that most guests come to your restaurant for intimate dates, you’ll likely want to arrange most of your tables for pairs, as opposed to communal seating. You can also gain an understanding of the ambiance your customers most desire. Whether it’s a quiet space with outdoor seating to a party zone with live music, getting the atmosphere just right can go a long way toward putting your guests in the mood for a feast.
Design your menu to sell more.
Your point-of-sale system can highlight your best-selling dishes and help you identify menu duds worth cutting. Analyze which items were most frequently purchased together, like burgers and fries or salad and pasta, and from there you can create meal deals. Bundling dishes will encourage customers to buy more at each sitting. By strategically designing your menu, you can drive customers to add items to their order and increase the overall restaurant check average.
Upsell strategically.
You’ll need to train your staff to gently nudge customers to meal deals or to select add-ons to their meals. When your staff understands the menu and the best pairings, they’ll be better able to compel customers to top off their order with that special wine, extra avocado, or truffle fries.
Training must cover how to upsell without badgering. Teach them how to read nonverbal cues and upsell in a no-pressure way. Some helpful phrases include, “Our customers often like X with Y,” or “Our chef recommends pairing A with B.” Simple suggestions, such as pointing out the “value” of the larger size, mentioning add-on options or describing the specials in vivid detail, can increase sales nicely.
And waiters that can smoothly offer wine refills or entice customers with dessert later in the meal will be even more successful at raising that average ticket size.
Motivate your staff.
Every interaction with your staff can influence a customer’s buying pattern. A waiter can guide customer’s orders, coaxing them into that additional drink or that higher ticket item. Encourage them to upsell smartly, and let them know your goal of increasing order sizes.
Your point-of-sale system can also track the average order size per server, which will highlight who upsells successfully and who might need some nudging in the right direction. Average server order sizes can range widely, so if you can lift order sizes across your staff, especially among under performers, you’ll be well on your way to beefing up your profit margin.
Restaurants are known for running on tight margins, but data analysis, premium offerings, a smartly designed space and menu, and a staff trained to upsell well can go a long way in increasing ticket sizes and your profits.

news_524,news,Merchant talkback: Walk-ins or reservations—what’s the right mix for your restaurant?,"It’s one of the trickiest questions in the restaurant business: should you take reservations? Your answer can dramatically change the experience customers have and the impression people form of your business.
…",27-06-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/merchant-talkback-walk-ins-or-reservations-whats-the-right-mix-for-your-restaurant/,"It’s one of the trickiest questions in the restaurant business: should you take reservations? Your answer can dramatically change the experience customers have and the impression people form of your business. A reservation-only approach can create an air of exclusivity—as long as you’re booking up fast. A no-reservations policy may make for a more casual atmosphere—but if the wait is too long, you risk turning people away.
Pros and cons of reservations
Reservations can help restaurants plan ahead for purchasing and staffing. Particularly for a restaurant with higher price points, they can be essential to ensuring a profitable business. Customers are also more likely to expect to need to make a reservation in advance for a more expensive establishment.
“When you are in that $200 check average, you want all tables accounted for; it’s too costly to wait and see,” says Kate Edwards, a restaurant consultant who also previously hosted at exclusive New York restaurants Balthazar and Per Se.
“It used to be that people planned ahead, but now they just go on their app and look up what tables are available that night. If you don’t have inventory out there, then you can’t meet that demand,” says Bill Chait, the restaurateur behind LA’s Tesse.
You never want someone with a reservation to have to wait, so if you do fill most of your tables with reservations, be sure you don’t overbook. Even restaurants that are “reservation-only” may hold back a couple of tables for locals or friends, or to ensure they can work around a table that stays much longer than the average. On the other hand, given that as many as 10 to 20 percent of reservations may end up as no-shows, some restaurants will simply give those tables away to lucky walk-ins.
Some restaurants charge fees for no-shows, but this practice remains controversial. Many diners and restaurant owners argue that it starts the relationship with the guest off on the wrong foot. But some see it as a necessary evil.
Pros and cons of walk-ins
A no-reservations policy tends to be associated with a more casual dining experience. Depending on the atmosphere you’re trying to create, this can be a huge plus.
“By not taking reservations, there is a certain lack of pretension. It is saying that we just want people to eat something delicious. And that people aren’t there for the scene—or anything else but the food,” says Momofuku’s David Chang.
“When you don’t take reservations, people have to wait for a table; they go to the bar and hang out. As every restaurateur knows, you make much more money selling a drink than you do selling a plate of food,” says the Spotted Pig’s Ken Friedman.
Of course, if you don’t take reservations, you need to plan for what customers will do while they wait—will there be a line out the door? Will customers wait in the bar? How can you make the wait time a part of the enjoyable dining experience, or at least minimize the unpleasant aspects of waiting?
“If people are denied admission again and again, they just stop coming,” says Frank Christopher, an owner of New York’s Smoke Jazz and Supper Club.
Technology can help. Wait-list management apps like Waitlist Me, Clavo Waitlist, and HostBuddy allow staff to add customers to wait lists and take care of texting them when their table is ready. Some even allow customers to join the wait list themselves online.
Finding a more flexible policy
Some restaurants may find a mix of reservations and walk-ins works best. Some will vary their policy depending on the season, day of the week, or time of day.
“We used to leave room for many more walk-ins at lunch, but now we are booking with reservations and keeping a lower count for walk-ins because our clientele is corporate and wants to be in and out fast for lunch,” says Marianne Eriksen, general manager at Agern in Grand Central Station, New York City.
“It’s too cold in winter, people want to know they have a reservation,” says Akhtar Nawab, chef and owner of Alta Calidad in Brooklyn, New York.
Ultimately, finding the best mix of reservations and walk-ins is all about knowing your customer—how long are they willing to wait? Are they planners or impulse-diners? How much foot traffic do you get, and how much does that vary day to day? Older crowds may prefer to make a reservation in advance; young parents may balk at a long wait; an after-work or coupled-up crowd may be happy to spend an hour at the bar before dinner.
If you decide to go with a mix of reservations and walk-ins, an app like SeatOn can help by allowing customers to make reservations or join the waitlist online. But whatever you decide, the key is to make every customer feel welcomed from the first moment they interact with you, whether that’s online, on the phone, or at the door.

news_525,news,"Clover Cares, and that’s good for business","It’s no secret that community service is good for business. We practice what we preach, so this article shares the evolution of our service program, Clover Cares. Read on for ideas that might help your business, too.…",09-07-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/clover-cares-and-thats-good-for-business/,"It’s no secret that community service is good for business. Forbes reports that providing time for your staff to volunteer increases employee engagement and collaboration far more than endless staff meetings or trainings.
For small businesses, developing a reputation for community engagement can also boost loyalty significantly. Wouldn’t you rather patronize a business that gave back to the neighborhood?

What better way to demonstrate our commitment to these principles than to share stories of our own community service program? Clover Cares is the initiative that helps pair Clover employees with local service opportunities near their office.
Back in 2014, when Jacob Schuit was working for Perka (now Clover Rewards), he worked with other team members to launch Perka Cares.
“It started with an email to our entire Portland office. I invited anyone interested in giving back to our community to attend a meeting. With fantastic response, we soon had a committee to help plan and execute some events.”

Those first events included selling raffle tickets at a Portland Timbers soccer game to benefit Active Children Portland, participating in a race benefitting a local school that promotes entrepreneurial training for at-risk youth, and serving a lot of meals to the homeless and in-need at the Transitions project.
Now that Jacob works directly for Clover, he’s taken what he learned on Perka Cares to shape the current Clover Cares program. With offices in Sunnyvale, NYC, Atlanta, Colorado Springs, and Portland, there is more to coordinate, but the benefits are undeniable.
He saw a number of individuals engaged with volunteer work, but there was no corporate organization to it. Asking for volunteers, he soon had a committee comprised of members in each office that agreed to plan a quarterly event.

To identify community partners, any Clover employee can make suggestions, and committee members facilitate relationships with nearby organizations for service events. For each event, Clover recruits between 5 and 25 volunteers for a period of 2-5 hours to help with a specific project or task.
In the first quarter of Clover Cares activity, we were able to provide 44 volunteers to 5 organizations: over 100 service hours given back to our communities.

news_526,news,Enterprise behavior: The 2019 guide to back-to-school planning,"Back-to-school season is the second biggest shopping period of the year. Deploying smart strategies to take advantage of this burst in spending can provide a healthy head start on fourth quarter earnings. 
…",10-07-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-the-2019-guide-to-back-to-school-planning/,"Back-to-school season is the second biggest shopping period of the year. In 2018, 29 million households across the country planned to spend more than $27 billion to equip their kids for the upcoming school year. Deploying smart strategies to take advantage of this burst in spending can provide a healthy head start on fourth quarter earnings.
Spending starts earlier than many business owners may assume, and appealing to early shoppers pays off. Around two-thirds of back-to-school customers begin shopping before August, and spend an average $100 more than those who wait until class is nearly in session.
But back-to-school time can mean much, much more than just school supplies. Even as families make the most of summer vacation, anticipating their needs in advance can mean a sizable boost in profit for nearly any type of business. Since young people’s tastes constantly shift, early testing of salability can help inform business strategies as back-to-school season progresses. Read on for strategic tips.
Maximize visibility with smart placement.
Office supplies and paper goods are perennial purchases for most adult customers; kids only covet them once a year. Appeal to young shoppers with prominent visual placement of staple items like backpacks, binders, and art supplies. Keep track of what sells to ensure inventory matches demand with Clover app Shopventory, which can help streamline re-ordering popular items from suppliers.
Bundle goods together for convenience.
Most dorm rooms call for similar home goods—bedding, towels, hampers, clothing hangers—that efficiency-minded customers can buy all at once. Show adults that you value their time and money with easily bundled special promotions, and play into students’ college excitement with displays that help them imagine a fresh start.
Prepare your staff to consult.
Every student these days needs a computer among a variety of other discretionary electronics. But which model and for what purpose? Training staff to field such questions (from adults and kids) inspires assurance that families are making a smart purchase from a business that understands their needs and budgets.
Celebrate the end of summer.
Starting a new school year can inspire mixed emotions for all involved, but one thing it likely means is less family time. Encourage customers to take advantage of the end-of-summer countdown with specials for family dining, like offers for kids to eat free or discounted extras like dessert or themed cocktails for parents.
Package meals to-go.
Quick service vendors can extend back-to-school season with brown-bag meals that families can grab to-go throughout the year. Make ordering ahead easy with Clover’s Order & Pay to seamlessly fit into customers’ morning commute, encourage repeat purchases, and save parents’ time on packing lunch. (They might even pick one up for the office, too.)
Promote creatively around the theme.
Manicures, blowouts, massages, and other spa services may be in order for parents who’ve successfully made it through the season, college kids arriving back in town, or teachers heading back to work. Clover Promos can help target promotions to returning customers, offering special discounts and a fun, seasonally appropriate reason to walk through the door.
Remember to track what works this time around, so you can repeat and adjust strategically when back-to-school season returns next year. Clover and its supporting apps can help assemble a big picture to see which strategies reap the best rewards.

news_527,news,2FA: What it is & why it’s crucial for merchant security,"Small businesses are prime targets for average hackers looking to score valuable information. For those looking for a simple, effective solution, look no further than Clover’s two-factor authentication, a powerful protective tool accessible within a few clicks.…",11-07-2019,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/2fa-what-it-is-why-its-crucial-for-merchant-security/,"Small businesses are prime targets for average hackers looking to score valuable information. Think about it: these merchants possess customer credit card details, employee social security numbers, and even more private data. Even worse, unlike major corporations, they often lack the resources to protect this information from cyber attacks.
Every small business owner should prioritize data security, no matter how “under the radar” they may feel. In fact, the risks are higher than expected and the consequences of a breach could force a business to go belly up. Roughly three in four small businesses don’t think they will be hacked, but about two-thirds of small and medium sized businesses faced a data breach in 2018. And 60 percent of small businesses are shuttered within six months of a cyber attack.
For those looking for a simple, effective solution, look no further than Clover’s two-factor authentication, a powerful protective tool accessible with just a few clicks. Of course, merchants should use a variety of security measures, but starting with two-factor authentication creates a crucial safeguard against lurking cyber criminals.
Read on to see how taking this very simple step can go a long way toward protecting your company and customer data.
What is two-factor authentication?
Two-factor authentication is a security measure that requires accessing a code from another device to log into your web dashboard. First, enable it with your Clover account by following the instructions below. Once enabled, whenever you login, a code will be sent to your smartphone. Enter this authentication number to proceed to your web dashboard.
How does it beef up security?
As a small business owner, there are a number of factors that can make your business more susceptible to hackers: high employee turnover, a lack of IT support, remote employees and poor password protocol are just a few examples. These holes in the system can be easily plugged up with two-factor authentication.
This extra line of defense prevents hackers from logging into your dashboard and accessing a trove of highly sensitive data.
After all, cracking a password can be easy, but gaining access to a physical device that supplies the second code creates a major hurdle for hackers, which is what makes two-factor authentication so crucial and effective.
Will it make logging in easier?
The great thing about enabling two-factor authentication: you don’t need to reset your Clover password every 90 days. And it’s possible to enable a feature where you only need to enter a two-factor authentication code every 14 days.
How do I set it up?

Log into your Dashboard
Go to Account Settings by clicking on Set Up in the left nav bar
Scroll down to the Two-Factor Authentication section
Enable SMS Authentication by entering your mobile phone number
Or set up two-factor authentication by using an Authentication App
Encourage all your employees to set up 2FA for their Dashboard accounts as well!

For more information on setting this up via the app, SMS, and more, click here.
Two-factor authentication could mean the difference between protecting your customer and company data and shutting the whole thing down. While employing multiple security measures is always encouraged for the stronger protection, two-factor authentication remains an essential early step. This alone could prevent 80 percent of breaches, according to Symantec’s 2019 Internet Security Threat Report.
So take a minute to enable it for your Clover account, and rest assured that you’ve taken a critical step toward protecting your valuable business from hackers.

news_530,news,Crowd pleasers: How & why to offer a referral discount,"Referral programs that reward customers for bringing in new business can boost your profitability. Key to implementing a referral program is finding the right combination of low-cost incentives that motivate your fans. Here’s what to know about offering referral discounts.  
…",18-07-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-how-why-to-offer-a-referral-discount/,"Referral programs work as powerful word-of-mouth marketing tools. Asking your loyal customers to spread the love for your small business, in exchange for a discount or reward, can make a big difference for your bottom line. By some estimates, referral marketing can increase profits by 16%; and overall, 92% of customers ask for recommendations from people they know before they buy.
Not convinced that a referral program is for you? Consider these data points:

Customers who are referred to you are four times more likely to buy.
Referred customers are 18% more likely to stay with you over time.

Like any loyalty program, a referral program that incentivizes loyal customers to spread the word must balance discounts and rewards with profit. What can you offer your referral program to increase your foot traffic (with old and new customers) without devaluing your products or hurting your bottom line?
Here’s how to offer a referral reward program to maximize profit and gain new customers.
Determine the value of a new customer.
For any rewards program to be profitable, the discount or incentive you offer must be less than the value of a new customer to your business. For example, pretend you run a $5 off campaign, and earn $1,500 during the promotion. Add up the number of customers who redeemed their $5 off coupon. If only 30 people redeemed their $5 off offer, your cost for the campaign was $150. The ROI is $1,500 divided by 150, multiplied by 100: in this example, that’s an ROI of 1000%. When you factor in that referral customers are 18% more likely to become loyal customers, that return starts to look even better.
The best way to determine the value of a new customer is to use a code to “tag” new customers who come through a referral. This gives you the ability to see their lifetime value, as well as adjust your discounts if you see your program is losing you money.
Find a low-overhead way to keep track of referrals.
Referral programs work best when they don’t cost money to implement. Plastic loyalty cards or punch cards can drain your operating budget. If you’re implementing a referral discount that counts on bringing a certain number of people through the door, you will want to think through a budget-friendly way to keep track of your referrals.
An app like Clover Rewards can give you the ability to tailor your rewards to specific customers, thereby saving in ways that might not have high visibility to other customers. Alternately, a customer referral reward app such as BuyFi makes it easy to track and reward those who spread the word about your business. You simply collect your customer’s email address at the end of a purchase and the program will email the referral offer out for you. It’s an efficient process: the customer refers you to friends, and if the friends buy, they all get rewards.
Be creative with your rewards.
Referral rewards don’t need to be solely financial. Be creative about what the perks are for bringing in a friend or family member. Discounts or freebies are nice, but what about something more in-depth? Offer an exclusive experience that resonates with your brand, a service that doesn’t add to your costs…be creative! Non-cash incentives, like a session with an in-house stylist or an invitation to an exclusive event, tend to be more effective. A study by the University of Chicago found that non-cash incentives are 24% more effective at boosting performance than cash incentives.
Reward the new customer—not just the referrer.
If your budget can handle it, expand your referral program to reward not just the initial referrer, but also the referee (i.e., the new customer that visits on a recommendation of the other customer). Both Airbnb and Dropbox have set good examples of how to make this work. Airbnb’s referral model gives a $20 credit to the customer, and when the friend signs up, they get a credit toward their first trip. Dropbox offered additional free storage to any referrers whose network signs up as a result of their recommendation. When shopping at your store is a win-win for everyone, it makes it easy for customers to share their love for your business.
Monitor what works.
Many business owners feel awkward asking for referrals from their customers. If you’re hesitant to get started, start with a limited time referral offer to judge how the program performs. Use analytics to inspect performance, see who is using it, how, and learn how much your incentives really cost. If the program seems successful, it can always be extended. Broadcasting that this is a limited time offer has the added benefit of boosting activity up front; create a sense of urgency and see how your customers respond!

news_531,news,"Growing pains: Great buzz is bringing in the customers, but derailing the customer experience","We should all be so lucky to score great buzz. That is, until surging popularity overwhelms what drew people to your business in the first place. Don’t let good buzz go bad! Learn about protecting the customer experience when you’re suddenly red hot.
…",23-07-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/growing-pains-great-buzz-is-bringing-in-the-customers-but-derailing-the-customer-experience/,"Buzz is like rocket fuel for a business—powerful but dangerous. Few accelerants are better at boosting demand and building a brand, but the volatile nature of buzz can make it a challenge to control and direct.
Much worse, it can backfire when being suddenly busier than ever causes your performance to suffer.
To prepare your business, let’s dive into a few timeless principles and some very handy tools.
1. Assume you’re going to drop the ball and have a plan for picking it up.
Entrepreneurs rarely get far without some fear of failure. Anticipating and planning for slow starts, lean periods, and worst-case scenarios is a given. It’s actually a healthy fear of success that’s typically a blindspot.
Too much too soon can take can take down big, popular, seemingly secure companies. Small businesses with limited resources are even more vulnerable. Restaurants hitting their stride, for example, have to determine how they’re going to keep customers content (and sticking around) when tables are full. But the fundamental considerations apply to any business.
It’s all about balancing expectations and resources.
For example, surging demand can quickly have you low on inventory (or out of favorite items entirely). Plan to get out ahead of it on social media. When you do, don’t just inform your audience, charm them. Can you create a promotion to compensate? From there, definitely source a good inventory management app like Shopventory to improve your ordering and closely track usage for the future.
2. Buzz-proof your location.
You’ve already worked on making your establishment inviting from day one. But have you visualized it packed? Or backed up out the door? The last person in line is more important than the first given that the clock is ticking on their experience and it’s easiest for them to walk away.
Plan for those spillover scenarios in terms of your physical space, anticipating how to adjust beyond your foundational customer experience tactics. Imagine a beautiful, vintage-style ice cream shop the moment it opens. Now imagine it so crammed with people the display counter is out of sight and reach. Does the signage still work? How is the interaction between staff and customers suddenly impaired? Does the flow of people entering and departing still function? Without an orderly and welcoming line system ready for a crowd, what would the inevitable jockeying of customers communicate to people entering that environment?
That’s why you want to reevaluate every customer-touching piece of your location through that lens. For some businesses, the applicable customer experience terrain can stretch pretty far outside their doors—e.g. to sidewalk space for a long line or available parking. You certainly can’t overcome all your limitations but, at a minimum, let customers see that you care enough to work on mitigating their impact.
3. Buzz-proof your team.
Staffing levels and employee training will be even more critical than the optimization of your physical space, though all those elements need to work together. Work closely with your team to make sure they are prepared to adjust and absorb buzz-driven surges before they happen.
Can you arrange to have extra help available on short notice? Can you make sure staffers are comfortable switching roles when needed? Don’t wait until you’re overwhelmed to figure out the problem areas. That sort of scrambling will inevitably underwhelm customers.
Take advantage of staffing apps that work right from your smartphone, like Homebase’s Schedule and Time Clock, which both integrate seamlessly with Clover. Also, remember that using Clover Flex can allow your staff to process orders for people while they are waiting in line.
4. Use Clover Feedback for constructive customer conversations.
You’re never going to fix every mistake or satisfy every individual. But if you get a reliable feedback system in place and commit to course-correcting around the issues that surface, you’ll be far ahead in terms of diffusing any buzz backlash.
That’s what makes Clover Feedback such a powerful tool. This super-convenient, closed-loop resource lets you find out exactly what customers think about your business while helping to keep negative feedback off public review sites like Yelp or Google. Clover Feedback prints a unique link to your private feedback form on every receipt. From there, you can:

Automatically receive the feedback directly in your email inbox and reply when needed.
View all of your customer feedback from your Clover Web Dashboard, and connect every customer’s note to an order.
Make up for negative feedback with coupon offers.

And it’s worth remembering that outspoken, unfiltered customers are often some of the best business consultants anywhere—at a fraction of the fees.
5. Finally, remember that buzz is a phenomenon, not a strategy.
Fashions fade. Trends change. Buzz dissipates. That’s built into the formula. As consumers, we definitely recognize that the next-best-thing spotlight works better at stimulating curiosity than sustaining loyalty. So if your business hitches a ride on buzz without a plan to reach escape velocity, gravity waits.
What’s the remedy?
Stay focused on your core customer. What they keep returning for is the customer experience foundation you need to honor and amplify most for sustainable growth. Follow those targeting coordinates to your business’s optimum cruising altitude. From there, the sky’s the limit.

news_532,news,Merchant talkback: How to handle difficult customers effectively,"Whether it’s because someone on your staff made a mistake or because that customer just happens to be having a really bad day, your business needs a strategy for dealing with demanding, impatient, or cranky customers. …",24-07-2019,https://blog.clover.com/merchant-spotlight/merchant-talkback-how-to-handle-difficult-customers-effectively/,"Difficult customers are a fact of life for small business owners. You can’t please every customer every day. Even with great customer service staff, you’ll end up with a few dissatisfied customers. Whether it’s because someone on your staff made a mistake or because that customer just happens to be having a really bad day, your business needs a strategy for dealing with demanding, impatient, or cranky customers.
Here are 5 tips for dealing with difficult customers, from small business owners like you:
1. Set clear expectations.
Two-way communication is key in establishing a good relationship with a customer. Train your staff to listen for moments when customers are communicating their needs. If a couple walks into your restaurant and says they’ve got tickets to a movie later, your waitstaff should not be trying to upsell them into appetizers and dessert. At the same time, clear, up-front communication about your policies can go a long way towards preventing complaints after the fact.

“We do not consider any customers difficult. We try to find out what our customers’ final needs and wants are before we start a project so we can work back from that, and can begin on the correct path to achieve and exceed their expectations.”—John Stampone, Major Printing Company, Union, NJ
“We have been pretty lucky in the fact that we have some really awesome customers! On the rare occasion we do have someone who is rude, we still treat them with the same courtesy as we do with the other customers—and remind them there are no refunds and say have a lovely day…”—Magnolia Emporium, Charlotte, NC

2. Show empathy.
Often, a difficult customer just wants to be heard. Try to show them that you understand what’s bothering them. Use the reflective listening technique: If they say, “I’ve been waiting for twenty minutes just to take care of a simple return!” then you say, “I hear that you’re frustrated about how long you’ve been waiting.” Reflecting their concerns back to them makes them feel like you understand—the first step to establishing a better relationship. It also gives them a chance to correct you if you haven’t quite understood, helping you zero in on a solution that will work for them.

“I think of some of the worst days I’ve had and how small acts of kindness and understanding from an employee at a store made things feel a little better.”—David James, Pioneer Pet, Seattle, WA

3. Do whatever you can to make things right.
When something has gone wrong for a customer, or an employee has made a mistake, apologize. Even if you can’t fulfill their specific request—say, if they want to return an item that’s been damaged for a full refund—make an effort to make amends in some way. Maybe you can offer them a partial refund, or a discount on a future purchase. Remember you’re trying not just to defuse this specific situation, but ideally, to keep this person as a customer in the future.

“Apologize for and explain the situation, issue a refund (if applicable), and offer an additional benefit for sticking with you. Have a set strategy for specific problems, but personalize each response. Great customer service can turn unhappy customers into brand advocates; poor service does exactly the opposite.”—Carlo Cisco, FoodFan, New York, NY

4. Stay calm.
Never allow anyone on your staff to argue with an unhappy customer. If you see a member of your staff having a heated discussion, step in, send them away, and apologize for their behavior. The same goes for you, of course—if you’re called in to speak to a difficult customer, keep your voice calm and even. If you get a negative review online, do not respond right away! Give yourself time to cool down so you can simply apologize and reach out to offer a solution privately.

“Listen and put yourself in his or her shoes—it makes a difference. Most people want to react, but the most important thing is to fully understand the problem and see it from the customer’s point of view before reacting. It’s easy to truly care about them. And once you truly care about them, it’s a lot easier to solve their problem.”—Dan Price, Gravity Payments, Seattle, WA

5. Learn from the interaction.
Sometimes a customer complaint can clue you in to a real problem that needs to be resolved. Be open to hearing what even the most difficult customers have to say. Once you’ve dealt with the specific issue, see if any of your company policies need to be updated. Make sure you’re training customer-facing staff to be patient and take the initiative to solve customer problems before they escalate.

“Unhappy customers can be a goldmine for how you can improve your product or service. Listen to them, and see it as a gift.”—Suzanne Smith, Social Impact Architects, Dallas, TX

news_533,news,8 eye-opening stats about why customer rewards programs are crucial to the bottom line,Customer rewards programs are an easy way to boost loyalty—and sales—for your business. Find out how a rewards program can make a huge impact on your business with these 8 eye-opening statistics.…,25-07-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/8-eye-opening-stats-about-why-customer-rewards-programs-are-crucial-to-the-bottom-line/,"This sounds like a silly question, but ask yourself: how critical are your most loyal customers?
You’re probably laughing to yourself at how absurd that question is—of course your most loyal customers are extremely critical to your business. You couldn’t get by without them. It’s a no-brainer.
But go beyond that initial response for a minute and really think about what those customers bring to your business. Think about the customer who comes in regularly and buys the same thing, every time—and now imagine that person comes in on the weekend, or every weekday. How much of a lift does that give your business? One Portland, Oregon coffee shop figured that out with their “$5.35 guy,” and the answers were eye-opening: Even if he only came in once every weekday he’d be spending $1,337.50 a year!
One key to attracting and retaining more of these “$5.35 guys (or girls)” is to create a rewards program that keeps them coming back for more—more often. Here are some stats to consider about why a customer rewards program is crucial to your bottom line:
What do customers think about loyalty?

56% of customers are loyal to brands they feel a connection with, while 89% are loyal to brands they feel share their values.
69% of customers will shop at a retailer based on what they get from their rewards program.

The bottom line? Get to know your customers and understand your audience. A big city feel to your establishment might not work in a down home country setting, and vice versa. Once you understand your audience, you can tailor your rewards program to make sure your store is always their first choice.
What do customers expect from your rewards program?

54% of customers think they wait too long to earn a reward.
61% of customers expect to be rewarded simply for being a customer, while 75% expect rewards for doing things like taking surveys or participating in social media campaigns.

It might be time to start thinking outside the box for your rewards program. Make it easier for your customers to cash in rewards points—for example, instead of 10 visits to get a whole sub, maybe add an option get a half sub after 5 visits. And if your loyal customers can spread the word about your business online, make sure you give them an extra incentive to do so, like a free small cup of coffee every time they share a video on their social networks.
Why personalization is so important

Less than a quarter of customers are very satisfied with the personalization level of their rewards program.
The number of satisfied customers is 8x higher when a level of personalization is present in their rewards program.

Personalization ties into everything else mentioned. Customers want to be more than just a number—they want to feel like they’re valued by your store. Your rewards program should recognize their preferences, like their most common order from your store, and remember important events like their birthday. These are simple ways to make a rewards program feel customized for each and every customer.
The role of technology in customer rewards programs

Demand for customizable, digital rewards programs will push the market to $201 billion in less than 5 years.
15% of department stores, 6% of activewear stores, and 5% of specialty stores launched digital customer rewards programs in 2018 alone.

The days of a customer rewards card are coming to a close. Consumers expect their rewards program to be as easy and intuitive as possible, and that usually means an app that holds all their information and keeps them informed about special deals or sales happening in your store. Clover Rewards, a free app available to all Clover merchants, checks customers in whenever they enter your store over Bluetooth, sends rewards on their birthday, and allows you to customize perks and bonuses for your regular customers and VIPs.

news_534,news,Business scenario: Why are customers unsubscribing/unfollowing us?,"What happens when your loyal customer base stops following you? Find out how to prevent customers from unsubscribing from your emails and unfollowing your social media pages with these easy, actionable tips.
…",01-08-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-scenario-why-are-customers-unsubscribing-unfollowing-us/,"Like every small business owner, you know that a loyal, engaged customer base is the key to success. But what happens when your customer base seems to lose interest or no longer responds to your promotions? More specifically, what happens to your marketing efforts when your customers unfollow your social media and unsubscribe from your emails and notifications?
Obviously, there will be some attrition, and that’s to be expected. But when the number of your Instagram followers drops precipitously, or when your email lists shrinks by dozens of names each month, it’s a sure bet that there’s something seriously wrong.
Thankfully, though, there are ways to identify when you’re in danger of losing more followers than is healthy, and there are solutions you can employ to fix these problems.
Email Unsubscribes
Research shows the people get on average more than 80 emails a day, often for stuff they don’t want or don’t care about. Most will just delete a marketing email they don’t want or ignore it. But if you send too many emails they will go the extra step to unsubscribe from your list.
The key to making sure this doesn’t happen to you is to delight your customers with messages they enjoy receiving.
There are many ways to do this including:

Monitor your emails—which ones get responses, and which ones fall flat. Then figure out creative ways to re-boot the ones that worked and get a similar response.
Make sure your messages offer real value to the customer. The messages should be about them, not you.
Monitor the frequency and make sure you’re not sending them out too often.
Divide your email list into groups and only send relevant information to that group. This is called segmentation, and the better you are at it, the less unsubscribes you’ll get. You can divide your list by things like demographics (for example, don’t send an email announcing a sale on women’s shoes to men), interests, buying habits and more. Abreeze Link, which connects MailChimp to your Clover POS, gathers information based on customer purchases to help segment your lists quickly and easily.
Only send to people who are actively opening your emails. For those who aren’t, only send them the most irresistible messages.
Make your messages more personal. Use the customer’s name in your messages. Send virtual birthday cards. Be fun and funny. The more your messages feel like a relationship the less likely they are to treat you like spam.

For those email unsubscribes you just can’t avoid, you do have some options. Beyond just doing nothing (which isn’t always a bad thing), you can give your customers an option to choose what kind of communications they receive from you, especially if you send out different emails for newsletters, sales, or coupons. Basically, you give them the option to select their own segmented list to ensure they receive the communications they really want while also keeping them on your list.
Social Media Unfollows
While social media is a completely different platform than email, it still serves the same purpose—it engages your customer base with content that they (hopefully) find helpful. If you start losing followers on your social media accounts, chances are that you have a content issue.
It could be that you’re posting too often and clogging up your customers’ social feeds, or that you’re posting content that’s too focused on sales and not enough on culture, which is something social media users have come to expect over the years. Whatever the case is, there are a few solutions you can try to get your social media efforts back on track.
One of the best things you can do when creating social media content is to see what your users say about your brand—you can even pose some questions about this on your social media pages—and then use that to make customer-focused content that truly speaks to your audience.
You can also use tools like Hootsuite or Buffer to schedule social media posts across your different pages, so you ensure you get the right amount of engagement—not too much and not too little—at the right times and in the right places.
Change up the type of content you’re using. Experiment with fun, interactive content like videos, quizzes, contests, and more.
Another important tactic is to examine your customer demographics and determine which social media platform is the best to reach them on. If your customers skew older, you should focus on Facebook, while you should put more effort behind Instagram if your customer base is made up on Millennials and Gen Zers. Once you have this information, it might be worth your while to put some spend behind social media ads which can be targeted at a specific demographic within a limited region.
Mobile Alerts
You might notice a trend here: unengaging content and overcommunication can deplete your email lists and social media followers, and it can also wreak havoc on any customers who opt in to receive mobile alerts from your brand. Mobile alerts add another wrinkle to this problem, though, since many people may find it intrusive to receive messages straight to their phones without a buffer like email or social media.
If you do choose to use mobile alerts, make sure the content is truly actionable and engaging, like a coupon or discount code, and only gets sent to your customers when they are in or near your business. The geotargeting feature helps cut down the amount of notifications they receive from you and while the coupon codes give them an incentive to stay on your list, while also providing them with an immediate reason to do business with you.
Customer communications can make or break your business. It’s crucial to get this right before customers start leaving your lists in droves, or worse, leave negative comments on your social media pages. If you follow the formula of sending engaging content at the right time and place, you’ll see an uptick in your followers and subscribers and your bottom line.

news_536,news,Business accelerators: How to market your restaurant space for special events,"Succeeding in the event-planning world takes more than just a special table in the back—to really maximize your restaurant’s event potential, you’ll need a tailored marketing campaign and some strategic thinking. …",08-08-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-how-to-market-your-restaurant-space-for-special-events/,"Hosting private events can be a great way to get the most out of your restaurant space during slow nights or slow months. And if you have or can create a private event space within your restaurant, you can book wedding receptions, office parties, birthdays, and all sorts of celebrations all year round. But succeeding in the event-planning world takes more than just a special table in the back—to really maximize your event potential, you’ll need a tailored marketing campaign and some strategic thinking.
Here are 5 tips for marketing your restaurant space for special events:
1. Think ahead.
Couples planning weddings will book their reception venues nine months to a year in advance. Office holiday parties often book about six months in advance, and a family celebrating a graduation or christening might want to lock in a reservation three months ahead. Think about the kinds of parties your space would work for. If you’re looking to book some office parties, for example, you should start putting out your holiday-themed marketing as early as May or June. If your menu changes seasonally, put together some sample winter menus you can show potential customers or share online.
2. Get specific.
Design your marketing materials with a specific type of customer in mind. Pictures of people enjoying your space will work better than shots of an empty room. Make it easy for the customer to imagine what their celebration will look and feel like. Grab some friends and stage a photoshoot if you need to. Tailor the images to the type of event you’re looking to book—create soft, romantic lighting to appeal to brides and grooms, or display some hors d’oeuvres to show what a corporate event might look like.
3. Know what sets you apart.
Make sure you’re offering potential customers more than just the facts about square footage and seating capacity. Do you have space for musicians? Can you wow guests with an open kitchen that puts them right in the middle of the action? Can you make a custom menu that suits an event’s theme? Will your chef mingle with the crowd and talk about her unique dishes? Think about what will set you apart from other spaces an event planner might be considering.
4. Use events to generate more marketing content.
Ask the party planners in advance if you can use a few photos from their event in your marketing materials or post them on social media. If it’s appropriate for the event, a photobooth or a special Instagrammable display like a cupcake tower can be a great way to encourage guests to post about the party on social media. Again, you’ll want to consult with the party planners, but for some events, you could encourage guests to use a specific hashtag or tag your restaurant’s page in photos.
5. Look for repeat business.
Always put the event planner on your VIP email list. You’ll want to reach out to corporate event planners again when it’s time to plan next year’s party. But folks who held personal celebrations should also be considered VIPs—they (hopefully) have fond memories of celebrating in your space, and can be converted into loyal customers. Consider offering party guests coupons for future visits, or telling newlyweds that drinks are on you next time they come in. Of course, the best way to win repeat business is to make the event as easy as possible for the organizer. Planning a big event is stressful, and the more you can do to make it a seamless experience for the guests, the more likely they’ll be to come back again and again.

news_537,news,Crowd pleasers: How real-time promotions can drive foot traffic & delight your customers,"Real-time promotions are a powerful way to connect with your customers and win their loyalty in the long-run. To help your business succeed at getting up close and personal with clever marketing that matters in the moment, we unpack some key principles and winning strategies.…",13-08-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-how-real-time-promotions-can-drive-foot-traffic-delight-your-customers/,"Like anyone with a smartphone and a pulse, you’ve noticed the phenomenon. Businesses are marketing to you through multiple platforms (email, social media, texts) and often get the word out about last-minute promotions or deals. Current philosophy dictates that the more you can get-up-close-and-personal with your marketing while making it matter in the moment, the better.
Convenient, easy-to-use Clover Promos has you covered. As for the creative part of crafting great real-time promotions, read on. After you grasp the basic premise, the best ideas will be your own. Even better, the process of developing a voice and finding your real-time rhythm can also be a lot of fun.
Before exploring actionable promo ideas, get to know the platform. Clover Promos makes it possible to execute and manage real-time promotions within moments of conception. It uses contact information customers have provided, and allows you to send special one-time offers via email, text message, Facebook, or Twitter. You can select certain segments of your audience to target with a few clicks.
Clover Promos also tracks redemptions in real-time, so you can assess how those offers are performing. And if you upgrade to Customer Engagement Plus, Clover Promos will additionally let you a) automate a schedule of future promotions and b) access more sophisticated targeting capacities to customize promotions for specific customer segments.
Now that you’re ready to get real-time with your promotions, let’s cover three key creative principles for any business:
Speak to your customers by speaking to the moment.
Real-time promotions are best when they align with an event, occasion, or circumstance that’s relevant to your customer, whether that’s the local weather or a national holiday. If a college town nail salon has a promotion the day before graduation accompanied by a playful reminder that hands and feet won’t be covered by the gown, that’s speaking to the moment. It’s both useful and conversational. There’s a message beyond the pitch, and both have brand value. A customer might not have time for the offer but can still appreciate the sentiment and sense of community and connection therein.
Something timely and trending in pop-culture can also be ripe for playful exploitation. Let’s imagine a bar located next to a multiplex. On the opening night of the new Joker movie, they could do an extra shot promotion for anyone who grew up afraid of clowns. The idea is to be present in the conversation by piggy-backing cleverly onto something apt that’s lighting up the radar.
Brand is character, and every character has a point of view.
Don’t think your business has a point of view (POV)? Well, if you operate a tanning salon, your POV—at a minimum—is that life is better with less pallor. And if your tanning salon is located in, say, Fairbanks, Alaska, your brand is probably going to be different than a tanning salon situated blocks from the beach in San Diego. In other words, brand POV lives at the intersection of product and audience.
If you’re going to be relevant to your customers, you have to speak to their lifestyle and sensibilities. Independent coffee shops, to illustrate, tend to be defined as much (or more) by their clientele as their coffee. Think poetry readings and singer-songwriters versus young professionals typing on their laptops. Communicating in the moment with real-time promotions is very much about first understanding what you have to say and how to say it.
By nature, some brands are more earnest and sentimental. Others are more irreverent and whimsical. There are countless points on the dial. The challenge is tuning into your sweet spot thoughtfully.
Experiment, take risks, listen, learn, and build on what works.
One of the inherent virtues of real-time promotions is that unlike conventional marketing campaigns, you’re not betting a lot of time and money on a single concept that, by design, must have the broadest possible appeal in order to return on that investment. With real-time, you can go niche. You can showcase a fresh side of your business and reach out in unexpected directions. Every single day brings new opportunities—and days that are typically slow will offer the most fertile turf for trying something completely different.
Here are a few proven winners to prime your real-time promotion pump:

Ice cream shops can offer customers a free second scoop during a crazy heatwave.
Coffee shops can offer a free extra shot when the Daylight Saving Time (DST) switch robs an hour of sleep from everyone.
Restaurants can stimulate dinner traffic on a slow night by “toasting” something positive in the news with half-off premium wine bottles.
Pizza parlors could offer a midnight-special during the local university’s finals week or tax season. Think free Red Bull with every pie.
Nail salons should offer one-day-only promotions during inclement weather or other times sure to be slow. Turn it into an opportunity to convert new customers by offering 30% off on all services to anyone who brings in a friend. (Also a winning idea for spas.)
Vape shops should offer promotions around esports events and other gaming-related tie-ins.
Bookstores should be all over pop-culture moments—e.g. a flash sale on George R.R. Martin books tied to Games of Thrones final episode.

news_540,news,Business accelerators: How to market your Quick Serve Restaurant for special events,"A growing number of Quick Serve Restaurants are launching catering services to reach more customers and boost their bottom line. Here are 5 tips for doing this well. 
…",20-08-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-accelerators-how-to-market-your-quick-serve-restaurant-for-special-events/,"A growing number of Quick Serve Restaurants (QSR) are launching catering services to reach more customers and boost their bottom line. If executed well, this extra revenue stream can help owners expand their business tremendously. And they may have most of what they need to get started. Think of catering as large-scale delivery. With some planning and marketing, an owner can drum up new, ongoing business by tapping into office holiday parties, birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, retirements, graduations, and more.
If you’re ready to grow your business beyond the walls of your restaurant, here are 5 tips for successfully launching your QSR’s catering business.
1. Develop a smart menu.
Limit the items you offer for special parties. Include your signature items, but keep the list of offerings manageable. This will help you streamline your catering operations and ensure that the quality of your product is top notch. Because customers remember the food served at parties, this is imperative for generating repeat business. Only pick menu items that travel well and are party-friendly. If food needs to be driven 30 minutes across town, you’ll want to ensure that the food will keep. And choose items suitable for big parties such as finger foods and shareable items that can be easily dished up.
2. Streamline operations.
Make sure catering work doesn’t interfere with your day-to-day restaurant operations. Require advanced orders so you can fulfill them without messing up your inventory and staffing plans. Another unique advantage: you can plan to get advanced orders out the door before busy hours, like lunchtime. This is just another way you can boost revenue earned during the off-hours. You’ll also want to dedicate a separate part of the kitchen to catering fulfillment and customer pick up. This will keep traffic flowing smoothly. And don’t forget to get the appropriate packaging for delivery. You’ll need disposable utensils, plates and napkins for the eaters. You may need to invest in containers that allow you to transport food at the right temperature. By streamlining operations, you’ll create a seamless experience from the moment an order is placed until the moment it’s enjoyed by your customer.
3. Harness technology.
Use technology to make the online ordering experience as easy and hassle free for your customers. If your ordering system works equally as well on a phone, tablet or computer, if the steps to placing an order are minimal, and if the interface is clean, you’ll be well-positioned to process orders quickly and attract repeat business.
4. Know your customer.
Catering sales are growing across the industry, according to the National Restaurant Association. There’s no longer a stigma from ordering platters from a quick-serve restaurant, and it’s often a welcome surprise when guests find their favorite restaurant’s food at a party. Tap into this growing market by understanding who your customers are and what they’re looking for, so that you can tailor your catering offerings accordingly. Are they families looking for a holiday fixings? Do local businesses need food for their office parties? Research your region and build a database of current and potential clients. From there, build relationships with people who want this service. These can include administrators at local corporations, nonprofits, religious organizations and schools, as well as event planners and frequent customers at your establishment. For VIPs, go the extra mile and host private events just for them, enticing them to come back for more.
5. Be strategic.
Continue to engage with your customers through strategic marketing. First, let your customers know that you offer catering. Feature this prominently on your website, in the restaurant, and on your social media. Throughout the year, adapt with the seasons. Plan your marketing ahead of major holidays and events, such as Fourth of July or the Oscars, so that customers know they can count on you to cater their parties. Encourage customers to post pictures of their parties—with your catering in the shots—on social media with your restaurant’s hashtag. Through pictures, marketing and consistent good service, your catering business may just become the life of the party.

news_541,news,Crowd pleasers: Hosting a class to grow your restaurant & bar sales,"Designed strategically, classes can be used to drive sales, reward loyalty, and generate word of mouth—all of which keep you front-of-mind with customers and a cut above competitors. 
…",22-08-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-hosting-a-class-to-grow-your-restaurant-bar-sales/,"Hosting classes can be a unique way to enhance and personalize patron connection to your restaurant. While customer experience has always been king when it comes to food service, a new study suggests it will overtake price and product as the key differentiating factor for any business by 2020. Designed strategically, classes can be used to drive sales, reward loyalty, and generate word of mouth—all of which keep you front-of-mind with customers and a cut above competitors.
Classes can work toward your business goals in a number of ways. Charging for classes could serve as a revenue stream on its own, or free classes may be packaged as VIP rewards. Either way, hands-on and face-to-face interactions will offer customers a look behind the scenes they won’t soon forget. Here are a few key ways to make sure you get the most of your syllabus.
Target repeat customers.
Patrons who’ve proven their loyalty will be first in line to learn how the sausage is made. If you offer classes free of charge, reserving them for VIPs can incentivize more casual customers to step up their game. Learning how a favorite dish or cocktail is prepared will only boost the personal connection felt by returning patrons, and encourage them to spread their enthusiasm to family and friends.
Invite new guests through the door.
Special offers set small businesses apart. Any cafe or wine store can deliver customer favorites, but not every shop offers tastings or workshops on pairing or preparation. Classes can be a great way to spark interest in new customers, particularly with modest free samples of what’s on offer.
Show off your top products.
Integrating the finest of what you have to offer is the best way to entice customers to your core business. Classes can also serve as a free and easy avenue for market research. Have a new product or recipe to test out? Take advantage of captive and interested parties to solicit feedback you can use prior to rollout.
Reveal your secrets.
Got a top-secret ingredient or special sauce? Taking customers into your confidence can pay off big time in redoubled loyalty. Host a brief demonstration to tell late-night pizza patrons what goes into the perfect crust or teach java connoisseurs how to draw designs in foam. Customers won’t be tempted to try these feats at home—that’s why they come to you. But they’ll appreciate the rare candor and insight into your culinary craftsmanship.
Partner up with neighbors.
Classes can also present fun opportunities to cross-pollinate with neighboring businesses. Think of hosting a flower-arranging class in your wine bar or cafe during off-peak hours, or linking with a brewery for pairings with your QSR menu. Encouraging customers to spend quality time in places where they’re typically in and out can help them slow down and appreciate everything you offer them.
Create a group experience.
Families and co-workers are often looking for ways to bond, and learning to cook or decorate a cake sure beats bingo night. Package classes as a group outing for anything from baby showers to college graduations. There are many life skills to be learned inside the walls of a restaurant—capitalize on them and bring people together in the process.
Market as a unique gift.
Similarly, a group class can be an outside-the-box gift for birthdays, anniversaries, or any special occasion. Loyal customers may particularly appreciate the opportunity to invite friends and family for an insider look at their favorite spot. Clover Gift Cards make seamless work of issuing and redeeming certificates and designing specialty cards.
Reward participation.
Every student likes a reward. Encourage enrollment by offering special incentives. Sampling during class could lead to a reduced rate on buying the full product to take home, or a discounted sit-down meal to cap off the evening. Cookbooks or face time with the chef can further strengthen customers’ bonds with your restaurant.
Be sure to keep track of what works, so you can adjust your strategies with the season and tailor them to your customers.

Fun surprises like this encourage customers to share what they’ve learned with others, both in person and on social media.
Bible Quotes

Here are three questions to answer as you get started with your holiday planning.…",11-09-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/three-questions-ask-begin-holiday-planning-small-business/,"For many retailers, the holiday season is rich with revenue opportunity. On average, over 20% of annual retail sales occur between Black Friday and Christmas, a period that accounts for less than 9% of the calendar year. This holiday season, the National Retail Federation anticipates the 2019 season to be even greater than the previous year, which showed a year-over-year increase in holiday spending of 4.55% to $719.2 billion—a 10-year high.
This surge in holiday spending makes it an ideal time of year to try out new promotions, bring new customers into the fold and grab your share of holiday spending. Competition for holiday dollars is fierce, though, advance planning is crucial. Here are three questions to answer as you get started with your holiday planning.
How did I perform last year?
Understanding your previous year’s performance is a great way to set a target goal for the current year. If you’re not sure where to start, consider using the average year-over-year increase cited by reputable organizations that cover your industry.
Small retailers, for example, might use the 4.55% figure cited above. If your business brought in $10,000 during last year’s holiday season, you could use this information to set a revenue goal of $10,455 for this year. Some sectors, like jewelry and toy stores, see a much higher increase in sales during the holidays.
Further, take a close look at which products outsold others and which promotions worked best. As you start thinking about what tactics you should use to reach your goals, those will be the best places to start. Clover customers can use Clover Insights to understand their average sales and highest-selling products during last year’s holiday shopping period to set their targets for this year.
How did similar businesses perform?
Your business is a great place to start to figure out what’s possible. Information about what other, similar businesses near yours were able to achieve during the holidays can add some additional context.
If average sales at similar businesses in your area for last year’s holiday shopping season were significantly higher than yours, for example, you can might consider setting a “reach” goal. Consider the average size of similar businesses in your area when thinking through this.
To figure out how other businesses achieved made it work, you can use old fashioned shoe-leather research: join their mailing list if they have one, poke around their social media accounts, and visit their location to understand their product mix and promotions.
Other helpful information to have include finer data points, like the total number of transactions and average receipt amounts for similar businesses in your area. These can help you make sense of the traffic volume and merchandise price points required to match their results. Clover Insights offers this type of aggregate sales information for similar businesses near your own.
What tactics can I use to reach my goals?
Armed with informed goals and an understanding of the best of your and your competitors’ previous tactics, you can be thoughtful about what specific strategies you’ll use this year to earn more revenue for your business this season. Here are the main areas you can tweak.
Reach more people with your marketing. Is your business a proverbial tree falling in the forest? Step one towards acquiring new customers is making them aware that you exist. From social media to email, SMS text messages to advertising buys on local media, consider ways to make more people in your target market aware of your business. Are you using all the available marketing channels to bring in more customers?  
Do more effective marketing. Not all marketing is about acquiring new customers. It’s 5 times more expensive to get a new customer than it is to keep a current customer. Consider focusing your marketing on rewarding loyal customers who already know your brand. For existing marketing, think about refreshing your creative and offers so that people who have already been exposed to your messages will pay attention to them. Make the most of people’s attention while you have it.
Make the most of your staff. Do your goals require you to have more boots on the ground to take care of customers? Sometimes making the most of your staff can literally mean having more of them on duty.
But it can also mean putting your best staff members on duty at a time when your volume potential is highest. Is there a bartender adept at handling a sizable crowd or server that flips a lot of tables per hour? Try to staff those star employees when their potential impact is highest. Clover Insights can see whether sales increase when particular staff members are on duty. Also consider finding out what techniques your star employees use, and training all employees to adopt those habits.
Increasing customer spend. Increasing revenue can be as simple as encouraging existing customers to spend more. Whether by stocking impulse buys right next to the register, training your employees to upsell, or running promotions that reward higher purchases, consider how to get more revenue with each customer visit.
Try new deals and promotions, and take advantage of gift-giving. The holidays can present opportunities to test new deals and promotions at a time when people are motivated to spend. The best of these can be ported into the new year. Additionally, the gift giving season lets you sell to new types of customers altogether: those who aren’t in your target market, but may be seeking products or gift card for people who are. Consider these types of customers when promoting your business and products.
In preparation for the holidays, develop a set of performance targets and consider what levers you’ll need to pull to achieve them.

news_545,news,Let’s make a deal: Holiday promotions that won’t break the bank,"Smart and effective marketing starts with a strategy. Before planning out any promotions, small businesses should think through what they are looking to achieve.…",25-09-2019,https://blog.clover.com/product-news/lets-make-deal-holiday-promotions-wont-break-bank/,"Smart and effective marketing starts with a strategy. Before planning out any promotions, small businesses should think through what they are looking to achieve.
For instance, promotions that work well for building customer loyalty may not work as well for bringing in new customers. Defining the business goal determines what kind of promotion will work best, and helps business owners later evaluate whether the promotion was successful. Not all goals require slashing prices, so consider your goal and promotion carefully. Here are a few common goals and promotion ideas to help get you started.
Goal 1: Get new customers
New customer acquisition is one of the most important activities a business can do. Increasing the number of people who interact with your business grows your base of possible customers and makes it easier to hit your revenue goals.
Offering new customers a deal on their first purchase is well worth its weight for their potential lifetime values.
Consider these promotions

Friends and family deal. Talk Triggers – Chatter Matters reported in 2018 that 83% of Americans say that word of mouth recommendations from friends or family members make them more likely to purchase a product or service. Apps like Digital Word of Mouth let customers share information with family and friends easily and greatly simplify marketing.
Offer a loss leader. If you have an in-demand item, or too much stock of a particular item, consider offering it at a deep discount—one per customer or new customers only—to get them in the door. Retail stores do this all the time, and typically make up the difference in “lost” profit by cross-selling customers other impulse buys, or getting their contact information to market to them later. Key to making this kind of promotion work is to get the word out through all available means.
Partner with another company. Find a business that complements yours and help promote each other. Hair salons and nail salons, for example, are a good match because clients for one are likely to be interested in the other. Cross-promotion can be as simple as leaving business cards in their waiting area, putting up signs, or offering a deal where the customer gets a discount for purchasing from both businesses.

Goal 2: Increase Customer Loyalty
Even businesses with a limited budget can increase sales by promoting customer loyalty. Personalization is one way to generate loyal customers, especially with Generation K and Millennials. Making shopping fun is another way to attract loyal customers: consider that more than 50% Generation K (those born between 1995 and 2002) and Millennial consumers are loyal to products and services that are fun.
Consider these promotions:

Hold an exclusive event. Member-only or “customer appreciation” events are a great way to bring in your best customers without cutting prices. They incorporate both the idea of personalized, exclusive offers and add in the fun factor. Restaurants and cafes could offer a candle-lit “date night” with good music; retail stores could offer seasonal product demonstrations along with coffee or other refreshments; food trucks might offer an exclusive invitation-only meet up. Consider what your customers would appreciate and make it appealing.
Offer exclusive sale previews. If you’re going to offer a sale, invite your loyal customers the day before and honor the sale prices. They get first dibs on sale prices, and help you spread the sale traffic over more than one day.

Goal 3: Grow Your Social Media Following
The market for social media marketing is constantly growing: one million new social media profiles are created every day. Social media is also a unique way to effectively promote a business because it’s another form of word-of-mouth marketing. Customers who share your promotions or marketing messages are in effect endorsing them and spreading the word to their networks.
Consider these promotions

Try a poll. Key to making your social content go viral is to create content the customers want to share. A salon, for example, could encourage customers to poll their friends and family on what hair length or color they should try next. They could then follow the poll up with before and after makeover photos with the business logo in the background.
Offer a contest. Contests need not be complicated to work well. Perhaps you host a seasonal contest where customers post photos of themselves using your products. Or ask customers to suggest a new flavor or name a new product. With apps like ivalu8 Customer Engage, you can create contests and promote them on your receipts and via social media. 
Support a cause. With “socialpreneurism” on the rise, finding new and creative ways to support local causes can be a great way to get social media traction. Customers are more likely to promote content (and purchase products) they feel good about. Apps like Coinout can also make the logistics of business and customer giving easy to execute.

Goal 4: Grow Your Email List
Despite the growth of social media, email is still one of the best ways to increase sales. According to the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), every dollar spent on email marketing brings in an average of 38 dollars in return. The cost-effectiveness of email marketing makes growing your email list a smart promotional goal.
Consider these promotions

Offer free advice. Whether baking cakes for special events or selling clothes, consider offering anyone who signs up for your email list a free one-on-one consultation to help customers through purchasing decisions.
Create a monthly fan newsletter. Monthly newsletters are a great way to engage with customers. Articles could be about what foods to pair with your products, special DIY projects customers can undertake using your products, or simply about topics you think your customers would be interested in. Newsletters are also a great way to announce new inventory, new specials, and events.
Co-promote the business with a partner. If you decide to partner with another local business, ask if they will bundle an offer with you and email it to their list in exchange for you doing the same. Make opting into your list part of the promotion. For example, “Sign into your account with us to get the promotion code. Don’t have an account? Sign up here.”

Goal 5: Test a new product or service
According to McKinsey Global Institute, only one in seven new products will succeed. Yet new products that take off can become money makers that help smaller shops differentiate from big box stores.
Before planning a major new product launch, carefully test new products with smaller promotions.
Consider these promotions

Free samples to customers. When ringing up a sale, offer a sample of a new product. Not only does this reward customers who are making a purchase, it encourages impulse buys and can offer you valuable information about product prospects on the spot.
Discounted prices for a promotional period. Rather than cutting your prices outright, experiment with offering half off a new product with the purchase of a full-priced item.
Host an event. Once a product shows promise, try a bigger launch. Announce new products with an event such as a pre-fixe tasting menu or fashion show.

The holidays are a great time to experiment with promotions and to grow your business. Whatever your goals, spend the time to think through which promotion offers the best shot at success. Plan out a budget, including how much you can afford to invest, and what you need to sell to make the investment worthwhile.

Here are just a few places to look for advice, support, financing, and more when starting and running your business.
Where to: find a mentor
Studies have shown that individuals with mentors end up finding greater career success. Better opportunities, raises, and promotions have been directly linked to working with someone who can guide you and offer advice. For entrepreneurs, mentorship is particularly important; yet women often come up against the “old boys club” mentality that prevents them from finding mentors with the same ease as men.

news_547,news,4 ways you can improve your cyber security now,"Make no mistake about it, small businesses are squarely in the crosshairs of cyber criminals. Thankfully, there are four definitive steps you can take to protect your business—and your customers—from the threats of cyber attacks.…",09-10-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/4-ways-you-can-improve-your-cyber-security-now/,"October is Cyber Security Awareness Month—a time dedicated for small businesses to focus on addressing issues with their computer and network security. Make no mistake about it, small business merchants are squarely in the crosshairs of cyber criminals for two reasons. One, their information (credit card data, bank information and personal information) is just as valuable as bigger merchants, and two, the very fact that SMBs don’t have a huge cybersecurity IT team makes them easy targets, and cyber criminals exploit this regularly. The numbers bear this out.
Overall, nearly half of all cyberattacks (43%) target small business. The consequences of these attacks are significant. Companies spent an average of $879,582 because of damage or theft of IT assets, and disruption to normal operations cost an average of $955,429. It’s clear the problem isn’t going to go away on its own. Thankfully, there are definite steps you can take to protect your business—and your customers—from the threats of cyber attacks.
1. Have a plan.
Obviously, the best way to survive a cyber security breach is to not be involved in one in the first place. But with the proliferation of hackers and cyber crime, it’s becoming more and more difficult to avoid. We’ve all heard the phrase, “failing to plan is planning to fail.” It’s especially true when it comes to cyber protection. Assess your company’s cyber security risks and be aware of the realities of the latest threats. Then, know how to respond in the event of a breach along with the proper ways to recover and mitigate the damage from cyber attacks.
2. Update your password.
Yes, this really is still an issue. And the reason is twofold. Sixty-five percent of SMBs that have password policies say they do not strictly enforce them. Luckily, the fix is pretty simple. Making a strong, easily remembered password is as easy as stringing together a few words—with spaces—that have significance to you. In fact, it makes more sense to call this updating your pass phrase. Multiple word phrases are far harder to break than single word and number combinations. Considering that 4 out of 5 breaches were the result of stolen or easily guessed passwords, the importance of taking this step can’t be overstated.
3. Upgrade your PIN device to a chip reader.
Lots of merchants drag their feet on this step because it requires buying a new device. But what a lot of small business owners fail to realize is that they really can’t afford to NOT upgrade their device. If you don’t upgrade, are stung by fraud, and are found not using the latest standard in cybersecurity, i.e. a chip reader, the business itself is liable to cover any losses incurred. In other words, not upgrading exposes you to potentially unlimited losses from fraud and could, quite simply, wipe your business out. It’s no joke and worth the investment.
Clover has a full suite of POS devices that can get you fully PCI and EMV chip compliant, each of which comes with built-in Clover Security. With the included end-to-end encryption and tokenization, your customers’ data is virtually unreadable, giving both you and them peace of mind.
4. Train your employees.
It’s the responsibility of the merchant to educate and train their employees (and contractors) into proper protocol and data handling procedures. Show them what to look for and teach them how to steer clear of potential land mines in things like phishing schemes or dangerous web practices. Then, review these instructions frequently. Hold quarterly updates to refresh and re-emphasize the importance of adhering to best practices.
With a comprehensive plan in place for your computer and network security, updated passphrases, upgraded POS systems and well-trained employees, your business is well on its way to improved cyber protection.

news_548,news,How to launch a subscription-based service for your small business,"Creating a subscription option for your business can be a great way to make your revenue more predictable, smooth out seasonal fluctuations, and delight your most loyal customers. But your concept and execution have to be spot-on.…",15-10-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-to-launch-a-subscription-based-service-for-your-small-business/,"Every business owner knows that a regular customer is worth their weight in gold. Consider this story about a man who buys a latte and a bagel every weekday from the same coffee shop. He’s only spending $5.35 a day, but the coffee shop would have to attract 10 new customers who visit twice a month in order to replace the revenue from “$5.35 Guy.”
But what if you could go a step further? What if you could charge the $5.35 Guy $107 a month, automatically? That’s the idea behind a subscription-based business model. It’s an attractive enough idea that the subscription e-commerce market has basically doubled every year since 2013.
Creating a subscription option for your business can be a great way to make your revenue more predictable, smooth out seasonal fluctuations, and delight your most loyal customers. But customer expectations are high in this space, and, according to research by McKinsey, customers are very likely to cancel a subscription that’s not delivering great value or a superior experience. That means your concept and execution have to be spot-on.
Here’s how to launch your own subscription service, in 8 easy steps:
1. Analyze your customers’ purchasing habits.
Start by mapping out how your best customers interact with you. How often do they visit? What do they buy most often? What do they buy at regular intervals? For a subscription box or subscription service to work, you’ve got to identify a product or service, or a type of product that customers will want to get on a regular basis—monthly or quarterly. That means staples that customers use often, or special treats they’d be excited to receive. Dig into the data from your loyalty program to generate some ideas on what your best customers buy again and again.
2. Research your competition.
There are a lot of subscription services out there. Whether you’re interested in books, food, beauty products, booze, dog treats, tea, or anything else you can think of, there’s a subscription box for that. Do a survey of the market and figure out who your competition would be. Start thinking about how your box or service would stand out in this crowded market. Get a couple of sample boxes from competitors in your space. What do you like about what they’re offering? What could you do better?
3. Come up with a theme.
Because there are so many subscription services out there, you’ll need to target a pretty specific niche. Think about your core business’s brand. What makes you different? What kind of story are you telling? Think about your best customers. Who are they? Maybe you can target your box at working moms, or vegan coffee drinkers, or amateur tango dancers. For a box, the more specific, the better. The other approach is to create a value-based subscription—target people who are already buying something regularly and give them a small discount for paying in advance for a year’s worth of product.
4. Think through logistics.
If you’re launching a subscription box, you’ll need to figure out who curates each box, where you’re sourcing products, and who’s packing and shipping the boxes. If your service starts small, you might be able to do fulfillment in-house. But you should figure out at what point that will get to be too much, and at least come up with a couple of options for outsourcing logistics if you need to. Similarly, if you start with just a few subscribers, you might be able to pull products out of your regular inventory—but as the service grows, it will become its own separate inventory management challenge.
5. Determine a price.
As with any product, getting pricing right is crucial to making your subscription service profitable. Make sure you’re charging enough to cover the costs of not just the product, but the logistics of sourcing, packing, and shipping. Cratejoy, a subscription box platform, recommends building in a 40% profit margin to make your box sustainable. Here’s a calculator that will help you work out how much to charge. Of course, if your subscription model is value-based, offering customers a “subscribe and save” discount on regular purchases, then you’ll want to calculate the price the way you would a discount for loyal customers. Your goal is to find a price point that’s attractive to the customer but sustainably profitable for you.
6. Put together a sample box.
Assembling a sample box is a great exercise to help you start getting into the details about the look and feel you want for your subscription box. In the world of subscription boxes, the unboxing experience is a big deal, so you’ll want to think through the design of the packaging as well as the actual items you’ll include. Many boxes also include a packing list that explains how products were chosen, gives the retail price of each item, and says a few words about the overall theme. This is a great chance to address your customers directly and make the case for why your subscription service is worth the price.
7. Start marketing before you launch.
Your sample box will also be invaluable as you start marketing your new service. Take plenty of photos and get ready to start sharing them online and on social media. Decide how you’ll reach out to your loyal customers to get them excited about this new subscription—by email, in person at the point of sale, with signage in your store. But don’t limit your outreach just to VIPs. A really successful subscription service will appeal not just to the people who already shop with you regularly, but will also work to convert occasional shoppers into loyal customers. Create a prelaunch period with a set timeframe to sign up customers and build buzz.
8. Launch and refine.
Even after you’ve launched your subscription service or sent out your first box, the work isn’t over (of course not!). You’ll want to keep reevaluating how the logistics are working, whether the price is right, how customers are reacting—what’s working, and what’s not. If you discover you’ve priced your subscription too low, don’t panic. There are ways to increase prices that won’t alienate your customers. For example, try adding some new options or offering a new bundled deal that’s more profitable for you, but still feels like a good value for the customer.

CloverAchievers, which Clover launched in May during National Small Business Week, celebrates the impact small businesses have on the U.S. economy. It spotlights business owners who are unique and authentic, passionate about their day-to-day work, and who go above and beyond to achieve success.
Applications were accepted through July 31st, 2019, and all small businesses across the country were invited to enter the contest, regardless of whether or not they were current Clover users. These businesses were all vying for a portion of $100,000 in value, consisting of a cash grant, credit for a “Clover makeover,” and a $5,000 donation made in their name to an approved local philanthropic organization of their choice. The prize was split in a tiered fashion amongst the first, second, and third place winners.
For the last two months, our judges have been working hard to evaluate the nearly 2,000 entries from small businesses all over the US. We asked entrants the following questions:

Why are you passionate about your business, and what makes your business unique
What’s the biggest struggle your business has, and how would winning this contest help you overcome that?

Additionally, entries were judged on their plans for growth, current and potential community impact, web presence, overall aesthetic, online reviews, and more.
Drumroll, please…
The first place winner is Ludwig’s German Table in San Jose, California. Ludwig’s, run by Nicole Jacobi and Ben Bate, is a festive restaurant, biergarten, and event space in the heart of Silicon Valley. Both owners run the day-to-day operations, and have a true love for bringing authentic and traditional German food and culture to the Bay Area. Right now, Ludwig’s is in the midst of opening a second location in Mountain View, California, and these funds will help them cover startup costs along with new Clover Flex devices so servers can easily take orders and payments on the go.
The second place winner is The Seafood Lady in Louisville, Kentucky. The Seafood Lady, run by Nichelle and Luke Thurston, can be summed up in three words: food, family, and faith. When Nichelle moved to Louisville, she missed the Florida-style seafood platters that represented her roots further south. Now she cooks up steamy plates of crab, lobster, crawfish, and veggies to delight her customers. The Seafood Lady is building a loyal customer base, and is in the midst of transitioning to a new location. The funds received from their CloverAchievers prize will help them bridge the gap so they can continue to provide their fans with the food they crave.
The third place winner is Harlem Doggie Day Spa in New York, New York. Harlem Doggie Day Spa, run by Brian Taylor, is dedicated to providing the finest cage-free boarding, daycare, and grooming to its clients’ pets. They focus on safety, cleanliness, client-communication, and tail-wagging dog happiness. More than half of their staff was, at one point, considered at-risk youth who needed a second chance. Brian has provided them with employment and a living wage to help them get on their feet without having to leave their home community. Current challenges for Harlem Doggie Day Spa focus on competition with giants like Wag, Amazon, and Chewy. Partnering with Clover will allow them to expand and streamline their services so they can connect to new customers both in Harlem and beyond.
Congrats to all CloverAchievers!
Congratulations to all of our entrants, finalists, and especially our winners. It was incredibly difficult to pick just three businesses out of the amazing pool of applicants, and we celebrate all of the CloverAchievers out there. We look forward to continuing our work with the small business community to help businesses thrive.

news_550,news,Enterprise behavior: Improving cybersecurity,"While big companies have teams to help them recover, 60% of merchants go out of business within six months of a security attack. Learn how to protect yourself against cyber criminals with Clover.…",23-10-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-improving-cybersecurity/,"Cybersecurity attacks against small businesses are on the rise. In the last year, hackers have breached half of all small businesses in the United States. Big companies like Target, Yahoo, and Anthem all have teams of lawyers, PR representatives and IT support to help them get back on track. Unfortunately, many small businesses don’t have those kinds of resources. The average cost of a single fraud to a small business? A whopping $9,000: unfortunately, 60% of merchants go out of business within six months of a security attack.
Despite the enormous risks, many of America’s 28 million small businesses aren’t thinking about cybersecurity. If this sounds like you—you’re in good company. A survey published by Manta discovered that 1 in 3 small businesses don’t have the tools in place—firewalls, anti-virus software, spam filters or data-encryption tools, for example—to protect themselves.
Protecting your business doesn’t have to be complicated, and it doesn’t require you to shell out thousands of dollars. Here are some simple, smart steps you can take to keep your company secure.
1. Switch to EMV chip card payment processing.
It’s time to stop procrastinating on upgrading to Clover’s EMV reader. In October 2015, all businesses that accept electronic payments were required to have EMV-compliant point of sale systems. Why is EMV a better security solution? EMV chip cards come with extra security features. Namely, the account information stored on cards is encrypted uniquely each time it is accessed. This makes it more difficult for fraudsters to strip useful pieces of information. When a business doesn’t have an EMV-compliant POS, they are automatically liable for any fraudulent transactions if they accept payment from an EMV chip card. Make sure your hardware is equipped to take payment cards with the new security features and protect your customers.
2. Keep your software up to date.
Those annoying pop-ups asking you to update your software every time you log in actually do serve a purpose. They are help you keep your system secure. As the experts at Tom’s Guide note, “an outdated computer is more prone to crashes, security holes and cyberattacks than one that’s been fully patched.” Hackers are on the lookout for security vulnerabilities. Each time you update your software, it gets a security upgrade. Keep your defenses strong—and stop those pesky pop-ups from disrupting your morning routine.
3. Secure your wireless networks
We salute the coffee shops, salons, book stores, and other merchants who generously offer their customers free wifi. It’s a great way to give keep your customers coming back for more. However, unsecured wireless networks are like a beacon for hackers. A vulnerable wifi hot spot is equivalent to leaving your front door open: hackers can gain access to the machines on your network for passwords and financial data.
Luckily, you don’t have to shut down the internet to keep your business safe. Put a password on your network (and change it regularly!). Keep your wifi updated to the latest encryption standard. If your customers don’t need access to your wifi, consider cloaking your network by disabling the service set identifier (SSID) broadcasting function By hiding your network, only users with the exact network name will be able to login to your internet.
4. Backup and encrypt your data regularly
Keep your data in cloud storage with an encryption feature to prevent hackers from stealing your customers’ information. Cloud storage moves your sensitive information off site, so in the event of a disaster, everything is still safe. Many cloud storage features have a setting that will automatically update and encrypt your data on a set schedule. Encrypting your data with a password can add another layer of security to your customer’s sensitive information.
5. Create stronger passwords, and change them regularly
Depending on the size of your business, you may want to consider two-factor authentication (2FA). With 2FA, a user needs two pieces of personal information to access an account, rather than just a password. This is a great security solution for businesses with two or three employees. However, if you’re bigger or growing, 2FA can slow down your team’s productivity.
Rely on a strong password strategy to keep your data safe. Require your team to create passwords that include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. Have a schedule in place for changing passwords regularly—at least once a month. Keep it unpredictable to discourage attackers from trying to penetrate your system.
6. Add antivirus software to your company computers
Antivirus software doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive. Usually, these programs are the last line of defense for your network. Antivirus and antimalware software gives you protection from targeted attacks—if your employee opens a spam email, for example. Business News Daily has a great rundown of the available security software on the market for smaller merchants.
7. Get Clover Security Plus
Clover Security Plus is a fast and affordable way to upgrade your business to world-class security status. This system is like having a Secret Service retinue backing up all your transactions, from swipe to finish. Clover Security Plus gives you end-to-end encryption and tokenization technology to protect your customer’s data. A built-in PCI compliance wizard helps you adhere to the latest security standards, along with a security score that helps you benchmark your data security and risk reduction. Reduce liability with extra coverage in the event of a data breach. The Clover team has your back: support experts will always be standing by to address any security questions or concerns you may have.
If you haven’t done so already, your first step should be to upgrade your POS to be EMV-ready. Keep your business secure, no matter what attacks come your way. Give yourself peace of mind with Clover Security Plus, and get back to doing what you do best: running your business.

It’s a concept we’ll call active community transplanting. Here’s the basic idea:

Stand out from the pack by offering something different. When people see something unusual and lively going on, they get curious. Activity attracts interest, and crowds attract crowds.
Reach and appeal to completely new audiences. It may feel uncomfortable to reach out to communities that aren’t your typical clientele, but that’s exactly what needs to happen.
Host events that translate well to social media or even local media coverage. The best bar marketing promotion is free promotion.

Self-proclaimed “watch nerd” Adam Craniotes spent countless hours on an internet message board for timepiece enthusiasts. One day, eager to meet some of those similarly obsessed pseudonymous characters in real life, he decided to invite anyone interested to join him after work on a Wednesday evening. The selected location was a divey, windowless lounge, tucked away up a narrow flight of stairs in Manhattan’s Koreatown district. First night, four people turned up. The following Wednesday at the sleepy Red Bar & Lounge, it was two, including Adam. But, with considerable help from social media, the numbers gradually grew and today his once-humble watch club now has 40 chapters across four continents.
And while his watch “crew” would take their name from that first meeting spot, Adam was lured to a larger lounge in Koreatown, Ichi Cellar, where the savvy owner recognized that by committing a prime bank of plush booths and generous drink specials to the endeavor he was going to boost his slow Wednesday nights from 7pm onward substantially (at a venue that typically doesn’t come to life until after 10pm on any night). A comfortable, uncrowded, easily-commandeered space with booze was pretty much all Adam and friends needed to meet up, talk shop, and compare watches. And of course, order drinks.
Collecting is social, and social media only makes it even more so. Granted, this particular success story is a remarkable one—and it didn’t happen overnight. But it highlights the real and accessible value of transplanting and nurturing a niche community. Once that bond is established, the dividends are evergreen. Adam and company continue to do all the heavy-lifting while Ichi Cellar, simply by remaining a doting host, wins big consistently.
So the question becomes, who can you draw to your establishment? Here are six ideas:

International communities. Think beyond Oktoberfest and Cinco De Mayo. Let’s say you have a thriving local Filipino community in your area. Reach out to someone already active in that world and offer to set up a free Filipino-style karaoke night every Tuesday, replete with drink specials and snacks. They key is finding, welcoming, listening, and nurturing.
Calling all foodies. Partner with excellent local food trucks or even do some pop-up restaurant pairings. The idea is to make some culinary magic happen on a weekly basis, with thoughtful drink specials to match. Who are the big foodies active on social media in your area? Give them a platform to meet their foodie followers IRL and share recipes. You don’t even need a kitchen.
Activate activists. Numerous charities and environmental groups (ideally ones with a big social component like the Surfrider Foundation), could have a chapter in your area. Make your bar their unofficial meeting spot by officially offering up a package of promotional incentives. Even better if it’s a cause that aligns with your bar’s brand, or has personal significance. There are definitely tangible benefits to establishing a charitable presence in your community. And millennials, who tend to spend more of their disposable income on going out, are especially active in social causes, often integrating them into their broader social life.
Lean into LGBTQ+. Sure, gay bars aren’t going anywhere, but we’ve come a long way since Stonewall. As current pop-culture underscores, young people are more fluid and inclusive than ever. Creating weekly nights that give a special celebratory social space to active, creative pockets of your local LGBTQ+ community and their allies can definitely turn a Monday into a Friday.
Get creative with creative types. Create a salon-like environment for visual artists, writer groups, spoken-word poets., singer-songwriters, guitarists, dancers, digital beat makers, yoga enthusiasts, or even simple book clubs. Give them a showcase where they can get comfortable and they will give you energy, activity, organic promotion, and, yes, drink orders. If you luck into a few really talented folks, they just might bestow the added bonus of fans who become a following.
Shop therapy. There are surely cool new brands and small business vendors making some noise in your area. Host weekly pop-up shop showcase events that they’ll promote for you. The bigger the social media following the better, but it’s also about products that appeal to a consumer segment that appeals to you. Same goes for the collector community route. Remember that shared obsessions are inherently social.

Scan meetup.com for active communities already doing interesting things. Once upon a time, the Beatles were a 50’s-rock tune cover band playing a suburban teen social club operated by their original drummer’s mother until someone from The Cavern, a real Liverpool venue, decided they might be a hit with the lunchtime crowd. Point is, if something interesting is already working on small scale, why not offer up the larger scale of your bar? Over time, support given becomes support received. And remember: if that active community is already out there and underserved, two people turning up the first night isn’t a failure, it’s a start.

news_552,news,Enterprise behavior: Beyond Black Friday marketing,"Need some Black Friday ideas for small business? Consider Small Business Saturday, Cyber Monday, and Giving Tuesday, too. Big retailers work hard to woo shoppers for this holiday kickoff week, but with basic planning, there’s no reason you can’t benefit as well.…",05-11-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-beyond-black-friday-marketing/,"It’s already November, and you know what that means: the holiday season is almost here. Traditionally, the holiday shopping season would kick off with Black Friday deals on the day after Thanksgiving. But these days, Black Friday and other themed shopping days sprawl across almost an entire week: major retailers start offering big discounts online and in stores on Thanksgiving Day, and Black Friday is followed by Small Business Saturday, Cyber Monday, and Giving Tuesday.
Americans spend a lot of money throughout this Thanksgiving week. In 2018, 174 million people shopped between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, spending an average of $335 per person. Thanks to steep discounts from major retailers, people still tend to gravitate towards gadgets on Thanksgiving weekend, but toys are also big. Online and mobile shopping continue to grow: in 2018, the number of shoppers finding deals on Instagram and Pinterest grew 73% and 45%, respectively.
Big retailers pour a ton of money and effort into wooing shoppers for this holiday kickoff week. With a little planning, there’s no reason small businesses can’t scoop up profits from the shopping frenzy. Here are four general tips for approaching the week:

Do one day well rather than trying to spread your marketing efforts across the whole week. (Read on for more specific tips for each themed day.)
Include media outreach in your marketing plan—local media mentions can make a big difference.
Don’t forget your email lists and social media. Retailers sent 3.5 billion emails on Black Friday last year, and 4.1 billion on Cyber Monday. Think about how you can reach customers who are sitting at home, spending time with family, as well as those who are out and about.
Talk to other businesses on your block. Can you do a joint promotion or shopping event? Maybe you can all offer similar discounts on the same day, or create a treasure hunt for kids that takes families into every store on the block.

How do you promote Black Friday deals?
Shoppers think of Black Friday as a day of retail discounts. If you can’t offer 40 or 50% off on your core inventory, think about what promotions do make sense for your business. Can you bundle items together to move stale inventory or push a new product? This is also a great day to debut your holiday window displays and start offering holiday gift wrapping. Recent trends show a lot of people are shopping for themselves this weekend, so a ‘treat yourself’ theme could work well, too.
Remember that promotions are only successful if customers take advantage of them. And to do that, they have to know about them! Announce your specials at least two days in advance on social media and over email so that shoppers remember to take advantage of your specials. A reminder email on Friday morning is a good idea, too!
How can you promote your business on Small Business Saturday?
This is a great day to highlight what makes you different from the big-box stores. If your business targets a specific customer demographic, focus your efforts on Saturday shoppers who want to feel good about supporting a unique local business. Think about ways to highlight the depth of expertise your staff has to offer, the connections you have to the local community, or the story of the passion that made you launch your business.
There are also good Small Business Saturday ideas for restaurants or coffee shops to focus on, particularly if you know that other businesses in your area will be participating and drawing in extra foot traffic. Consider adding extra signage like a blackboard outside so that people out and about might wander inside.
How do people prepare for Cyber Monday?
Any business can participate in Cyber Monday: a restaurant can offer discounts for booking reservations online, a spa or salon can run a promotion for pre-booking appointments, and of course, retailers can offer discounts or free shipping on online orders. But with 4 billion retail emails flying around on a single day, you’ll want to think about ways to stand out with a unique theme or personal touch. If you’ve already been working on an online store or subscription service, Cyber Monday could be a great day to officially launch in time for the holiday shopping season.
If you’ve got ecommerce already up and running, now’s the time to test everything again—your site needs to be mobile-friendly. Make sure that if you have limited inventory, you don’t accept orders you can’t fulfill quickly. Any loyalty you might earn with great Cyber Monday deals will be lost if you can’t process the order in a timely manner.
How do you make the most of giving Tuesday?
Giving Tuesday is all about giving to charitable causes, so for-profit businesses can’t benefit directly. Giving Tuesday is also a great time to talk up any charitable contributions your business makes. Could you offer space, supplies, or food to a local charity running a Giving Tuesday event? You could also choose to launch a new initiative on Giving Tuesday. Even something as simple as connecting to the Round Up for Schools app and encouraging shoppers to give a few cents to local public schools would be in the spirit of the day. But if you’re running a not-for-profit entity, this could be a great day to offer a discount for new customers or donors, or launch a promotion that highlights the good work you do.
Wrapping up
The holiday season is huge for any retail business, and there are ways for every business to participate in the themed days that kick off the season. Big-box retailers and their steep discounts may dominate the headlines on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but there are plenty of savvy shoppers out there looking for something a little different. With a little creativity and planning, your business can find ways to stand out in this crowded shopping season.

news_553,news,5 questions to ask before running a social media campaign,Have you tried your hand at social media marketing only to realize you have no idea how to tell if it’s really helping your business? Consider pay-to-play social marketing. And ask yourself these 5 questions before you run a social media marketing campaign. …,12-11-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/5-questions-to-ask-before-running-a-social-media-campaign/,"Tried your hand at social media marketing only to realize you have no idea how to tell whether it’s really helping your business? You’re not alone. According to some studies, as many as 61% of marketers struggle to measure ROI for social media marketing campaigns. But there’s another way to take your business social and measure success. Paid social.
Pay-to-Play Social
Paid social or promoted social content is paying to have your social messages or ads play to a specific group of social media users. This tactic helps businesses target consumers, track costs and ROI, and measure responses from introduction through conversion. It’s relatively inexpensive and gives Google Ads a run for its money.
What’s more, paid social ads tend to perform well because they:

look like other social posts, so they prevent what marketers sometimes call banner blindness;
can be targeted precisely based on criteria you choose;
are easy to set up and manage; and
encourage engagement through comments, replies, and likes.

To be sure you’re ready for pay-to-play social media, take a look at five questions all small business owners should ask themselves before launching a new social media marketing campaign.
1. Why are you launching this campaign?
Before you log into your social accounts, create copy, or design an ad, you need a plan that addresses the “why” of your campaign by defining your goal and budget.
Every successful, measurable campaign has a goal, and maybe even two. For example, your primary goal may be to acquire more Twitter followers, in the hope of turning those followers into customers later, your secondary goal. As you articulate your goals, be sure to note how you’ll measure them.
Your social campaign budget should account for the cost of writing engaging copy, designing social ads that work for your customers, and running those ads on a social channel. Keep in mind, the success of your campaign rides on the quality of your ads and their ability to stand out from other posts your audience encounters. For more on what it costs to run a paid social campaign on the most popular social channels, check out this summary.
2. Who is your audience?
One of the benefits of a paid social campaign is the ability to target users. What’s more, a successful paid social campaign often hinges on understanding your target audience. The more you know about them—who they are, what they want, what they need, where they look for information—the more likely your social campaign will reach them.
If you want to reach prospective customers on social, start with your existing customers. Why do they do business with you? What need do you meet for them? How much money do they typically spend with you? What products are most popular among them? Where do they live? And what social channels do they typically use?
If you’re struggling to answer these questions, ask your customers directly. Chat with them as they come into your shop, drop them a quick email survey, or call your most valuable customers. Remember that customers regularly experience survey fatigue, so figure out a way to reward participants or make your survey fun and quick. Don’t forget that you can find great resources available for free online, like this Pew study on consumers and social channels.
3. Where can you find your audience?
Fortunately, many of the social platforms most popular among consumers—Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn—offer paid campaigns. Before you decide which platforms to include in your campaign, check out the advertising rules and conditions of those platforms.
Here’s a short list of campaign information pages for various platforms, for your quick reference:

Facebook
Twitter
LinkedIn
Instagram
Pinterest

As you select your social channels, set realistic, measurable expectations for those channels. For example, this comparison of Twitter and Facebook indicates that they may not be best for direct lead generation, but they’re great at placing your brand in front of a targeted audience and for starting conversations. Those engagements can forge trust and turn into business over time.

4. How will you reach your audience?
Creating a paid social campaign isn’t your only step in reaching your audience. Consider the following five tactics to make sure your campaigns have impact.

A landing page is a page that a user reaches when clicking the link in your ad that speaks directly to the population you’re targeting in your paid social posts. It’s a great place to elaborate on the details of your product, campaign, or promotion. It can be a page on your website or a unique page you build that sits outside your site. These tools can help you create one quickly: shortstack and unbounce.
Email is a great way to engage your prospects or customers. Collect an email address on your landing page, and send a follow-up thank you with a coupon or promo code.
Blog posts are effective for articulating more about your campaign, product, or service. Just be sure you have a writer at-the-ready to help you craft a post that engages readers and cuts through all the other social content.
Social media influencers are power users who help customers like yours make decisions about products. Think food critics, home improvement bloggers, or wellness writers. Reach out, ask them to co-write a blog post, review your product, or participate in a promotional campaign.
When you think search engines, you probably think keywords. But many businesses forget that social platforms also rely on keywords for searches. When you craft your paid social content, be sure to identify keywords users enter when searching for products, services, or businesses like yours and infuse those keywords into your copy.

If you decide to make social—paid or unpaid—part of your ongoing marketing strategy, consider these tools to help you automate social posts.

Hootsuite is a powerful, subscription social media dashboard that allows individuals or teams to schedule posts, monitor analytics, manage social advertising, and more.
Buffer is a super easy-to-use social media scheduling app that offers performance metrics and makes scheduling multiple posts at one time very simple.

5. When is the best time to reach your audience?
Timing is everything, as they say. And that’s especially true for social advertising. Whether you’re deciding on a one-time or an ongoing campaign, knowing the best time of day, day of the week, or even month to launch your campaign can mean the difference between a successful campaign and one that falls flat. Check out the best times for publishing on these popular social platforms.
However, you can also coordinate with your own promotional schedule. If you’ve got holiday promotions coming up, it’s a great time to think about a paid social campaign. If you time it right, it could be perfect for launching your holiday frenzy.
Ready. Set. Launch.
Have answers to your 5 questions? Ready to begin work on your campaign? Just a few more things to consider. First, think about security. Who will have access to your social accounts? Make sure that only trusted team members can have access, and that they have unique user accounts so that you can easily change their permissions if their behavior or employment status changes. There have been plenty of headaches for businesses with social media errors. These mistakes can range from accidental posts to having disgruntled employees lock their supervisors out of their accounts with password changes. Secondly, think about having a single point person for each campaign—especially in the follow-up phase. Creating meaningful engagement with social users and turning social media followers into customers is a marathon, not a sprint, so make sure you dedicate time and team to manage your social advertising strategy and campaigns.

news_554,news,Crowd pleasers: How restaurants can attract families,You don’t have to overhaul your business model in order to become a more family-friendly restaurant. A few smart steps can help drive traffic and delight larger groups (including those with kids) the next time they dine in. …,19-11-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/crowd-pleasers-how-restaurants-can-attract-families/,"For families tightening their budget, dining out may go from being a regular occurrence to being only a special treat. It’s important to think about how you can make your dining experience more family friendly, since it’s been proven that families are good for business. It isn’t just about catering to children, either. Family structures include parents and grandparents that might have special needs, or hoards of cousins looking for a place to hang out and catch up. Demonstrating that your restaurant can meet the needs of various types of families (including families of choice) can make your establishment a desirable destination for large groups of differing compositions.
You don’t have to reinvent your business or invite kids to eat free in order to become a more family-friendly restaurant. A few smart steps can help drive traffic and delight eaters of all ages. Winning over children can boost customer loyalty, too. We all know who calls the shots when the spaghetti hits the floor. Here’s how to make sure families keep coming back.
Rolling Out the Welcome Mat
Prep Your Staff
Families can be, well… trickier than your average 2-person table, especially if those groups include children. Train your staff with best practices for serving families—addressing kids directly but deferring to parents, giving families space in case of a tantrum, and making sure they have everything necessary to dine comfortably. If there’s someone celebrating a special event, say a 70th birthday, a wedding anniversary, or a graduation, make sure that all staff is aware of the guest(s) of honor so they can offer their personal greetings and congratulations.
Stock Up
There are lots of things that can make your restaurant more family-friendly. Think about serveware for family-style entrees and drinks that will fill the table without making it feel overcrowded. Consider turntables for larger tables so that all members of the family can reach the food without having to pass heavy platters.
Crawl Around
You don’t have to go overboard child-proofing, but be mindful of where you’ll seat families with young children and make sure the space is suitable. Is there room to park a stroller? Any low-hanging decor within arm’s reach? Designate areas most befitting your smallest patrons. Shop smart for booster seats and high chairs (with attention to the latest safety guidelines) and install changing tables in bathrooms for moms and dads. Sippy cups and bibs are optional accessories, as most families will bring their own.
Beyond the Kid’s Menu
Spice It Up
It goes without saying that you should have a kids’ menu. If you already do, stick with what works. Consider emphasizing healthy options so dining out seems less like an indulgence. Kids sometimes have more adventurous palettes than many menus give them credit for. Start with spiced ketchup or mayo and experiment with branching out. Think about this when building a prix-fixe menu, too. Often, special menus offer only the simplest dishes to appeal to the masses. But aunts and grandpas can have a wild streak, too. Toss in a signature dish that might be a little spicy or unusual and it might just be the thing that people talk about long after the meal.
Tableside Prep
Consider tableside prep for shareable dishes and appetizers, like guacamole or specialty salads. Turning any dish into a show makes it more special and is sure to make groups more curious to try it. If it’s tough to talk with your second cousin twice removed, having some activity at the table might jumpstart a conversation.
Hands-On Dishes
Go a step further and try offering interactive dishes like fondue, a chocolate fountain for dessert, or build-your-own tableside sundaes. Just be sure any heating elements are out of reach of small children, and minimize the potential for mess by laying down table covers or making extra napkins or towels easy to reach.
Mealtime as Playtime
Interactive Games
Crayons and paper tablecloths are classic, but also consider more creative games that connect families to your space. Think visual scavenger hunts that kids can easily play from the table, or special menus and placemats with puzzles and trivia for school-aged kids. Clover app Fun and Games can customize coloring sheets with your restaurant theme or logo. But games aren’t just for kids. If you have puzzles or activities for adults, it can help unite a family that may not always have that opportunity.
Fun Zone
If you have space for kids to roam around, a break from wrangling can be a relief for parents. Be sure it’s safe and comfortable, and make it clear to parents whether you have staff keeping an eye out or parents should still be on deck. If there will be food or drinks in the area, think about stain-proof materials, or easily wipeable surfaces.
Play Days
Consider hosting events with live entertainment, creative classes, or simply setting aside time especially for families. This could be a good way to fill the lull between lunch and dinner when some large groups are looking for activities and places to socialize.
Summary
Family-friendly can go way beyond kid-friendly if you are creative. As the holidays approach, large groups are often looking for places to congregate, socialize, and dine so they don’t have to be responsible for the prep or the cleanup. Offer prix fixe menus if you are open on the major holidays, and advertise your specials on your website and through social media to get the word out. Remember, families are rarely going to stumble into your establishment. They’ll do their research first.

news_555,news,Enterprise behavior: Boosting staff morale,"In the mad rush to keep orders filled, bills paid, and customers happy, it’s easy to forget about employees. As long as they show up and do the job, all is well, right? Wrong. People working the frontline directly impact the bottom line. And if morale slips, the business will suffer. Learn about three ways to lift employees’ spirits. 
…",26-11-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/enterprise-behavior-boosting-staff-morale/,"In the mad rush to keep orders filled, bills paid, and customers happy, it’s easy to forget about employees. As long as they show up and do the job, all is well, right? Unfortunately, that’s not always true. People working the frontline directly impact the bottom line. And if morale is low, the business will suffer.
For one thing, disheartened employees are more likely to leave, creating a financial drain. Hiring and training a new employee costs about one-third their annual salary, according to a 2017 report from Employee Benefit News. That means that if you are replacing an employee with an annual salary of $45K, the cost to you, in addition to salary, will be about $15,000. Another problem is that low morale can lead to disengagement and subpar customer interactions, which no small business owner can afford.
Remember that low employee morale also places a risk on your privacy and security. Like many technology companies, we work hard to ensure security on all of our devices and services, but data is only as secure as the intentions of those who have access to it. Keeping your staff motivated and engaged can lower the risk of theft and dishonesty among your team.
As a business owner, it is on you to tune into employees and read their moods. Are they energized and giving their best? Have inertia and discontent seeped into the workplace? Maybe stressful conditions—long hours, demanding clients, or a seasonal rush—have put a damper on employees’ attitudes.
One strategy is to redirect established customer satisfaction tactics toward employees. Just like ongoing loyalty-boosting programs, programs that lift employee spirits are easy to fold into the regular workday.
Here are three ways you can show your employees how much you appreciate them:
1. Use monetary and non-monetary rewards to build loyalty.
Do you reward loyal customers with discounts, free items, or special privileges? Then do the same for a loyal team! The more experienced employees are, the more valuable they become, so reward them with financial perks such as incremental raises, end-of-year bonuses, or extra vacation days.
Similarly, paying higher-than-market wages can boost productivity and enhance morale. Scott Shane, a Case Western Reserve University professor, notes that “When companies pay more than the prevailing wage, their employees tend to work harder and are less likely to quit.”
If financial incentives are too difficult, nonmonetary incentives can work just as well. Publicly recognizing a job well done, bringing in lunch for the team, and other simple gestures make people feel their work is appreciated.
2. Listen to staff concerns and resolve conflicts fairly.
When a customer comes with a problem, savvy business owners know to stop, listen, and resolve the issue. The customer’s needs and concerns are top priority, no matter how small or even irrational the requests might be.
What if you extended that same focus and priority to employees when they come to you with their concerns? When people know they can share problems—be heard and understood—a culture of trust develops.
One of the most common complaints employees have is friction with peers. Rather than ignoring it (which is a natural response), you should treat conflict as an opportunity to learn and improve the workplace environment.
Through active listening, you can glean information to bring people together, find common ground, encourage compromise, and set boundaries to prevent future problems. In the long run, conflict resolution is far easier than doing nothing and letting simmering tensions eat away at morale.
3. Find reasons to celebrate.
Holidays are great opportunities to reach out to customers and attract them to a business. Special menus, offers, seasonal decorations—these efforts spark positive feelings and foster loyalty.
In the same way, you can create a festive atmosphere for their staff, and build bonds and loyalty. Additionally, keep track of birthdays, major events in employees’ lives, and other ways to celebrate the people who share the amazing, challenging, never-ending experience of running a small business.
Summary
Employee turnover is a costly endeavor that can quickly eat away at your profits. Instead of resigning yourself to these expenses, think about investing in your staff on an ongoing basis. Acting on the tips above can go a long way towards keeping morale high among your team.

news_556,news,7 tips to turn holiday shoppers into loyal customers,"As classic crooner Andy Williams famously sang, “It’s the holiday season!” It’s also the season of turning first-time shoppers into regulars and VIPs. Here’s how small business owners can capitalize on holiday promotions and activities now to build customer loyalty in 2018.…",03-12-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/7-tips-turn-holiday-shoppers-loyal-customers/,"As classic crooner Andy Williams famously sang, “It’s the holiday season!” What the song doesn’t mention is that it’s also the season of building customer loyalty.
A recent study by Blucore discovered that retailers only manage to retain 10 to 15 percent of first-time shoppers in the six months after the holiday season. With retail sales expected to total nearly $1 trillion this year, your number one goal should be converting these customers into regulars, or better yet, VIPs.
Building customer loyalty isn’t accomplished overnight or with one exclusive discount. In fact, it’s better to show you care in a multitude of small ways rather than one grand gesture. So where should a busy business owner start? Here are seven quick tips to motivate those first-time holiday shoppers to make a return visit.
1. Entertain and engage customers.
If you create a worthwhile, truly unique experience for a first-time shopper, they’re much more likely to visit your business again in the future. Gain an edge over large retailers by enriching your customer interactions—provide tactile or interactive experiences, offer product demonstrations, or distract children while parents shop. Have the magic of the holiday season carry throughout the New Year and offer these types of entertaining experiences all year round.
2. Follow up and follow through.
Developing relationships with your customers is very similar to gardening. For them to thrive, you need to expend some care and affection. Otherwise, their interest in your business will wither. Holiday spending is no joke. Deloitte’s 2019 Holiday Retail Survey reports that the average household plans to spend about $1,500 this season. More than 75% of shoppers also reported that they plan to spend the same or more as they did last year.
To hold onto these high-spending customers, use Rewards to nurture customer loyalty and satisfaction after their initial engagement with your business. Sign first-time customers up with Clover Rewards and delight them with a discount, exclusive offer, or a special event sent via email or text message a few days after their inaugural visit. Be sure to tout your ability to accept hands-free payment in your message. That convenient feature will make it even more likely that you’ll turn a busy holiday shopper into a repeat visitor.
3. Go the extra mile.
The simple act of sending a personalized email thanking new customers for their business is a small gesture that can have a big impact on successfully wooing them back through your doors. Same goes for their birthday and holidays. Send a note with a discount that can be redeemed during the recipient’s birthday month and another during the holiday season with a private deal, gift with purchase, tiered discount offer or even an exclusive item available only to those on the mailing list.
4. Get personal.
When customers join your loyalty program via Rewards, they’re trusting you with their personal contact information. Treat them in kind by offering yours. Sales clerks should offer a business card with a phone number and the hours they’re available. As a business owner, share your contact information in your initial email mailing and invite your customers to contact you whenever they need assistance or have questions. Shoppers appreciate business owners that make themselves personally available (as opposed to big-box retailers who are run by faceless, nameless entities that cannot be reached). You can also ask customers to share their “wish list” items. Use these ideas to expand your offerings, then reach out once you have them in stock.
5. Be the expert…
Forbes has written about the importance of in-store expertise over online reviews. But don’t just rely on customers asking for advice to demonstrate your expertise. Develop creative ways to proactively steer shoppers to specific items, including sections labeled Staff Picks, Customers’ Favorites, or Product of the Day/Week/Month. The consumer marketing app Rocket Responder can help you attractively publicize these picks. Its easy-to-use editing capabilities elevate any product without requiring any design skills.
6. …in more than just what you sell.
Savvy business owners use email marketing to do much more than just promote your product. To build upon initial in-store interactions with their customers, they create and share helpful, interesting content in their holiday marketing. If you sell gourmet food items, for example, write a short post about a recent health study involving nutrition. Or link to recipes that utilize items you sell.
7. Exceed expectations.
The holidays are usually filled with stressful moments: family gatherings, holiday travel, overwhelming crowds, even lost packages. Each situation feels more nerve-wracking than the last. You can solidify long-lasting relationships with customers by exceeding expectations during the holidays. Consider mailing packages with 3-5 day shipping to customers who chose 5-7 day shipping. Use Promos to send high-value, real-time promotions via email, text, or social media to VIP customers and those you hope to reel in for subsequent visits. (You can track success in real time and tweak future promotions accordingly if redemption rates are lower than you’d like.) Or add a small free gift to every purchase. The small price you’ll pay for these gestures will be repaid in full—and then some—in customer loyalty for weeks, months, and years to come.
Wrapping up
Yes, the holidays are the busiest time of year for you and your business. But it’s also probably the most profitable time. If you can implement even a few of these simple tips, you might just see an uptick in your returning customers when the holiday season comes to a close.

news_557,news,Celebrating your staff after the holiday rush,How can small businesses on a tight budget show appreciation for the work employees do during the holidays and throughout the year? Check out these staff appreciation ideas that require less cash outlay than bonuses but reap dividends in goodwill.…,10-12-2019,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/celebrating-your-staff-after-the-holiday-rush/,"In the flurry of winter holidays, small business owners may find themselves with little to no time (not to mention limited budget) to figure out how to thank the people who make business possible—those who take and fulfill orders, handle sales, restock inventory, bake goods, serve customers, or simply keep things chugging along. Roughly 63% of companies (though most participating in this survey were large corporations) reported offering a holiday cash bonus in 2017, averaging $1800 per employee, as a way of sharing holiday cheer with their team.
Many small businesses and startups simply don’t have that kind of money in the budget. But with some forethought and planning, showing appreciation for your employees on a budget can be more manageable and affordable than you might think.
In fact, a 2018 survey found that 42% of businesses surveyed were planning to reward employees at year end in other ways, spending about $65 per employee—definitely a more palatable outlay for small business merchants.
So before this holiday season slips into the past, take a moment to consider how you can show appreciation to your team—and to yourself—for a season and a year of hard work. Consider these staff appreciation ideas to make the biggest impact with a minimal expenditure.
Personalized gifts go a long way
When it comes to employee holiday gifts, one size rarely fits all. Take a box of chocolates or a bottle of wine, for example. They’re perfect gifts for some, but not everyone wants or appreciates these treats. And while they might be simple, egalitarian, and relatively inexpensive, buying identical gifts en masse for employees simply doesn’t communicate the same level of appreciation as a personalized gift.
What’s the secret to a memorable gift? Knowing the recipient. So before you order a batch of gifts for your employees, take a moment to think about what each person might enjoy. Do your employees talk often about hobbies, music, or films they like? Do they participate in a sport? Have you noticed colors, foods, or something else they surround themselves with at work?
For starters, consider unique gift bags or baskets stuffed with items you’ve picked for each employee—think candles, comic books, or candy. Imagine the fun your team could have exploring and sharing their finds with each other. Or, personalize wearables like tees and hoodies, and be sure to pop your brand logo on each. Think about the items your team uses in the workplace. Maybe you give them personalized items to make their everyday more comfortable—comfy aprons or top-drawer knives for kitchen staff, fuzzy slippers for customer service teammates, or personal coffee makers for third-shift employees.
Getting creative and personal can go a long way in demonstrating appreciation and can pay dividends in building employee satisfaction and loyalty.
Collaborate to give
Just as workplace collaboration can create a more productive, enjoyable environment, collaborating with other organizations can create a more memorable, meaningful thank-you gift for employees.
Team up with another local business to provide unique gifts for your employees. Or, team up with your employees and another business to do some good for your community, which will help inspire goodwill and gratitude within your team.
Say your restaurant partners with a local baker to provide meals for a shelter, school, or other underserved group in your community. You close shop for a day after the festivities, compensate your employees their regular rate, and dedicate time to merriment and meal-making—each meal delivered personally with a handwritten note from your team. Imagine the good that could do for the recipients and the goodness it could inspire within your team. Make the day extra special by ordering a favorite meal for your team, running a movie marathon in the background, or playing each teammate’s favorite tune as you work together.
Further, partner with local businesses to provide a sampling of goods to your team. Reach out to local grocers, breweries, or farms to create themed baskets to gift.
Or, simply give your employees a paid day off to volunteer at a charity of their choice. Organize a team meal later, providing time for teammates to share a word about their volunteer experiences.
For more inspiration, take a look at how three businesses celebrated their employees and did some good in the process.
Little things can make a big difference
A memorable gift doesn’t have to be big. In fact, sometimes the best gifts aren’t. Check out a few ideas for small, tangible gifts that can go a long way.

Gift Cards: Offer employees a gift card to local shops, theaters, or sporting events, based on what each person likes. Mix it up and give different gift cards (of identical value) to different employees.
Movie Passes: There’s nothing like watching a movie on the big screen. Consider providing movie passes that include snacks to enhance the experience.
Extra Holiday Inventory: Share unsold holiday inventory—whether it’s decor, food, or clothing—with your team. It’s a great way of reducing on-hand inventory, and it builds good will. Couple it with other goodies to make an even bigger impact.
Free Day: Downtime is at a premium for most people. So consider thanking your employees by giving them an extra day of paid vacation. It’s relatively inexpensive and simple to manage, not to mention an unforgettable gift.
Employee Dinner: Invite your team to an employee dinner party. Take them out, invite them to your house, or bring dinner to work. In all cases, take time to share a word or story about the positive contributions of each teammate.

Whatever little gift you offer, consider including a hand-written note to each employee recognizing what they have done to make your business more successful. And be sure to read these handy tips for getting employee perks right.
Experiences are unforgettable
Things can break, but memories can last a lifetime. Create great memories for your employees with these ideas that show your gratitude and create stand-out experiences.

Off-site Rewards Day: Close shop for a day during the post-holiday, pre-tax season slump. Invite your team to an offsite fun day. Meet at a theme park, museum, skating rink, bowling alley, or other place of interest. You might even qualify for a group discount.
In-house Spa Day: Bring in a massage therapist, esthetician, or manicurist for an in-house spa day. Turn the office or shop into a spa with candles or incense. Offer a selection of infused waters and delicious munchies to make the day extra special.
Take a Class Together: Whether it’s pottery, truffle making, or design, learning something new together is a team-building opportunity, a wonderful way to say thanks, and demonstrates your commitment to enriching your team.
Do a Tasting: Take your team to a local vineyard, confectioner, or brewery for a tasting and meal. Have an expert on-hand to explain what separates the spectacular from everything else. Just be sure to choose a locale that offers a broad variety of samplings and can accommodate diverse tastes.
Employee Holiday Party: For years, companies have thrown holiday parties for employees. But not all parties are a success. When choosing a locale, time, and menu, keep the planning centered on employees’ needs. Do any employees commute long distances to work? Would an evening timeslot knock anyone out of attending? Would taxis or Ubers help get your team to and from the party safely? Check out these tips for showing appreciation with a well-executed holiday party.

Putting it all together
Whatever you choose to do and however you choose to do it, remember that employee appreciation is an ongoing responsibility. Pay attention to the activities that seem to resonate best with your people. Those activities can lay the foundation for your next employee appreciation day or even an ongoing employee appreciation program. And, above all, take time to enjoy the experience with your team.

It’s incredible how quickly 2019 has come and gone. A lot has happened this year—from new products and services to stronger security—but what has not changed is how much value we place on our relationships with you, our merchants. You’ve kept us honest, and you’ve kept us busy!
On behalf of my team and our extended Clover family, it’s with a lot of gratitude that I share the highlights of 2019 and a quick peek under the hood for what’s to come in 2020.
 
We’re Listening
One of the most critical and rewarding aspects of our business is listening to our merchants. Without understanding your needs, wishes, and frustrations, we would not be able to build POS systems that work the way you need them to.
It’s in the details, as they say, and that’s what our merchant community has been saying as well. We’re looking at ways our POS systems can better serve restaurants, retail stores, beauty salons, automotive shops, building contractors, accounting and law firms, and other industries. Because no matter what kind of business you run, you’ve got customers, you’ve got staff, you’ve got inventory or services, and you need to take payments. So for us it’s not just the big flashy stuff that matters; it’s also the small tweaks and improvements that exercise a lot of leverage. It’s things like making the Clover dashboard more integrated and functional, Clover Dining more robust, our security protocols tougher, and our 3rd-party integrations deeper (more on that in the next section).
 
Future-Proofing Your Business
For us, future-proofing is about making sure we’re always a few steps ahead, so by the time you need something, it’s already there. So we spend a lot of time poking under the hood. Asking you questions. Listening to what works, what doesn’t, what you really want, and what you don’t need.
Big on our list is helping you get paid no matter how your customers want to pay. Our systems already accept debit, credit, and gift cards, NFC contactless payments, checks, and cash, but now with Virtual Terminal, launched early in 2019, you can take payments directly on your computer, tablet, or smartphone. That of course includes other activities related to transactions, like refunds and receipts.
Also top-of-mind is the speed and power of our hardware. Our latest hand-held POS, the Flex 2nd Gen, was launched just last month—and it’s all about speed. Speed of payments, applications, even the device itself—Flex is now 250% faster.
Another area of attention for us is Clover Dining. Since its launch in October 2018, Clover Dining has been gaining steady, solid traction among our restaurant merchants. But we haven’t exactly been sitting on our laurels. This year we introduced Scan to Pay, which enables guests to take care of their bill on the spot with Apple Pay®, and other features that make things simpler and more efficient for restaurants and guests alike.
We’ve also been busy working on more ways to help you build lasting relationships with your customers, through our Customer Engagement (CE) solution. For starters, you can now reach out to your customers directly from the Clover Dashboard, via Promos. We’ve given digital receipts a facelift with a new rich-format template. Most importantly, you get more out of CE for free: building customer lists is no longer behind a paywall, and you also now have 3 free trials for Promos.
On to Clover Go, our go-to POS solution for smartphones. We added inventory management, in-app reporting, more admin controls, support for Rapid Deposit, and continuity of service during outages.
The Clover App Market has been busy as well. Our merchant community has reviewed over 110 3rd-party apps, giving them an average rating of 4.2. We appreciate your feedback because it helps improve the apps, and helps us understand what you need and why. We take a lot of pride in making sure our key app partners deliver the very best and stay on top of features and functionalities that support your business needs.
For example, if you use Nav, you can now enable fraud and credit alerts. Over in the Yelp world, you’ll now see your most recent customer reviews directly on your device, whether or not you’ve claimed your business (we of course recommend that you do).
 
Your Financial Health
The financial stability of our merchants’ business is a key priority for us. This means everything from cash flow to access to capital to reporting and billing.
We’ve overhauled the reporting platform on the dashboard from both a front-end and a back-end perspective. The visual redesign makes the dashboard reporting functions much clearer and more intuitive, and gives it a better look & feel. We’ve added an easy-to-read deposit report, which provides insights into details such as card processing fees and final net amounts deposited.
On the billing side, we’ve made the automatic notifications you receive simpler and clearer. Details like these might be small, but we know they can make a world of difference, especially when it comes to your numbers.
We’ve also expanded our services to include access to capital for our merchants. Rapid Deposit is a great way to speed up the traditional settlement process and get your money in as little as a few minutes, and Clover Capital is an advance against your future sales with flexible repayment options. More details on those two services here (please note they’re available only via select sales channels).
 
Security, Compliance, and Accessibility
We take privacy, compliance, accessibility, and security very seriously, and continue to invest time and resources to these areas. We stay up to date on our regulatory obligations in the United States, Europe, and other territories where we operate, and design our products and services with those obligations in mind. We take equal pride in making sure that our devices and systems are compliant and properly accessible, and that your and your customers’ data is secure.These are the things you, as a business owner, should never have to worry about.
A good example of our security measures is Virtual Terminal’s new card-on-file functionality. This ensures that saved credit cards are properly encrypted, reducing the risk and impact of data breaches, malware, and phishing attacks.
All of this is our way of doing the right thing by you and your customers.
 
Paying It Forward
At Clover, we believe in being an active member of our community, whether on a local, national, or international level. This year, I’m personally proud to share that we started up our own internal employee volunteer program, called Clover Cares. This program organizes service opportunities for our internal staff and makes it possible for them to realize meaningful impact in their local communities. 140 of our employees completed over 350 volunteer hours. We have served 16 non profit organizations across 6 of our locations in California, Colorado, Georgia, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.
Another initiative from this year that I’m especially proud of is CloverAchievers. We launched CloverAchievers this past May, during National Small Business Week, to honor small businesses throughout the U.S. Three Grand Prize winners were selected and awarded a package worth a collective total of $100,000.
Finally, you can pay it forward straight from your Clover system: our partnership with DonorsChoose enables your customers to round up their purchases, and you to donate that extra cash to schools in your community.
 
Looking Ahead to 2020
This year, Clover became part of Fiserv, a global payments and fintech leader. As part of our integration with Fiserv, which will continue into 2020, we made our debut at Fiserv Forum, home of the National Basketball Association’s Milwaukee Bucks. Clover now powers payments for all Fiserv Forum food and beverage concessions.
We’re excited about our association with this company of innovators and experts, and proud to have the support of Fiserv’s trusted brand as we move into the new year. We’ve certainly got a packed 2020. Here’s just a taste of the year ahead:

Helping you deepen the merchant-customer relationship. Relationships are what lies at the core of every transaction and interaction. It’s just as true for us as it is for you. So we get how important it is for you to build deeper relationships with your customers. Watch for new enhancements in CE, our customer engagement suite.
Taking the merchant experience up another notch. Streamlining the complete merchant experience on a system as complex and multi-faceted as Clover doesn’t happen overnight. Look for continued innovation there.
Innovating our hardware. For us, hardware is just as big a part of the Clover experience as software and payment systems. We’re always working on ways to make our devices faster, sleeker, and more powerful. More to come on that front in 2020.

As we close out 2019, on behalf of my entire team here at Clover, I want to wish everyone a great holiday and to thank you for being a part of the Clover community. And if you haven’t already, subscribe to our blog to stay in touch and up to date as we head into another exciting year.

news_559,news,Business refresh: How to declutter your small business operations,"Decluttering: it’s not just for your kitchen cabinets. Streamline your business by following some of the principles of decluttering your home. This five-step process can help you tap into your original passion, focus on results, and run a tighter ship. 
…",07-01-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-refresh-how-to-declutter-your-small-business-operations/,"Happy New Year from Clover! It’s that time of year when it’s traditional to examine past performance and lay out goals to help your business thrive and grow in the year to come. Periodically evaluating and refreshing your business strategy can help keep you sharp, identify consumer trends, and stay ahead of the competition.
This is a great time to focus on how to revitalize different aspects of your business, starting with your business operations. How can you streamline and declutter your operations to run more efficiently?
Marie Kondo’s popular Konmari decluttering method entered the zeitgeist in 2016 and continues to clear out closets and spark joy in homes around the world. Konmari isn’t the only decluttering approach: the Minimalist Game, the Four Box Method, and the Packing Party are a few others that all aim to help individuals get rid of “stuff.” While these methods were originally designed to declutter the home, merchants can apply the same basic principles to running a business.
The turn of the decade, after a busy holiday rush, is a great moment to expand your usual business analytics with a value-driven approach to running a tight ship. Reflect on what inspired you to start the business, reconnect with your passion, and take steps to make any changes you need to going forward into the new decade.
How do you streamline in business?
Streamlining in business is a bit different from cleaning out the closets in your home. The goal of evaluating different areas of your operations is to apply the principles of decluttering to run your business more efficiently and remove friction points that cause stress throughout your workday.
The basic rules of decluttering vary by method, but there is one overarching principle. Instead of deciding what to get rid of, decide what it is you want to keep. Gregg Schwartz at Forbes encourages you to go back to your original vision for the business: “If you had to design your sales funnel today for the first time, starting from zero, what would it look like? How long has it been since you updated your sales call scripts, your company mission statement, or your elevator pitch?”
Through this lens, you can decide what systems, practices, and tools are working well—and where you need to reevaluate. Maybe your payroll system creates more headaches than it solves. Or maybe your logo no longer represents the brand you’ve grown into. Every part of your business is on the table, from how you organize your stock room to the uniforms your employees wear. Throughout this process, take a step back and ask, “How does this help me get my job done?”
5 Steps to Decluttering Your Business
Ready to dive in? Start with these five steps to clean up your operations and find pleasure in running your business.
1. Create a process.
Start organizing by… getting organized. Begin by deciding on the goals and priorities for your overhaul. Identify the areas of your business you feel can be improved and set the order in which you are going to approach each challenge. Think about your biggest pain points in a typical business day. If you’re a retailer, you might consider your inventory management, floorplan, staff scheduling, and payroll, as well as your e-commerce site.
2. Visualize the endpoint.
What does success look like at the end of this process? Possible goals might include: less time spent on payroll, an easier way to communicate with employees, or better inventory management. A salon owner, for instance, may look at her original vision for the business and recognize that she’s spending too much time managing appointments, and not enough time getting to know her clients. Her original vision for opening the space involved creating a community where stylists and their customers could socialize, exchange beauty tips, and destress during appointments. Instead, she’s spending too much time sending appointment reminders, scheduling her staff, and billing.
Reverse engineer how to achieve your goal before getting your hands dirty with the work of actual change. Do your research—the solution could be as simple as adding Schedule by Homebase to your Clover POS. Or, it could be more involved, like changing your store hours or launching a loyalty program. Put every solution on the table before taking action.
3. Dive deeper into your business.
Whatever you do, be as thorough as possible. If you’re going to evaluate your payroll, evaluate every single aspect of your payroll before moving on to something else. This includes—reporting, accounting, hourly scheduling, taxes, and anything else connected with your payroll system. The biggest danger in starting this kind of overhaul is doing 85% of a task and then stopping. It can leave businesses in a lurch, customers stranded without their desired products, and employees confused. Seeing your tasks through is crucial to the success of this process.
4. Do you still love it?
Take stock of your emotional connection to certain areas of your business. Reflect on why you started this venture in the first place. Most small businesses are a labor of love: tap back into that feeling to fuel your motivation and continue to serve your customers well. As you streamline try to do so with positivity. It may mean you end partnerships with certain vendors; if that’s the case, do so with gratitude, thanking each vendor for growing with you this far. “Whether you’re cutting ties with a client who is no longer a good fit, getting rid of an outdated brochure, or changing some aspect of how you do business, be grateful for what you’ve discarded and be thankful for any new opportunities,” writes Forbes.
5. Tidy by category.
Declutter experts recommend you tidy by category: clothing, paper, or kitchenware, for example. In your business, this applies to specific business practices. Payroll and reporting is a good place to start, as finances tend to be a common source of stress and profit-loss. Scheduling is also a good one, as few business owners find pleasure in organizing staff schedules.
Let’s say a doctor’s office is trying to reduce the long waiting time patients face when visiting a clinic. The office manager might add new communications and scheduling tools to make it easy to bring in doctors who are on call. Or, they might dive into appointment analytics to see how long, on average, a patient spends with their caregiver. Clover’s reporting and analytics tools can offer deeper insight into where time is lost throughout the day, and how to make it easier to schedule more efficiently.
A clothing store might be having trouble managing their inventory. The store owner could look at their store layout to see if it’s easy for customers to find what they’re looking for. They might dive into their ordering schedule to see if they’re ordering too frequently or in the wrong quantity. Or, it might take re-organizing the stockroom to make it easier for employees to keep inventory moving and meet customer demand. Go through every step in the process to find ways of improving the sales process, create upsell opportunities, and reduce waste.
Summary
Decluttering your business is a great way to get focused and drive better business results. It allows you to reconnect with the passion that inspired you to start this venture in the first place. And, the process of streamlining helps ensure you continue to grow sustainably for years to come. The goal is to find joy in your business: as the cliche goes, do something you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.
Decluttering is a practice that can—and should—be iterative. If you can’t get all of this done at once, not to worry. Revisit what inspired you to start the process throughout the year and make adjustments to keep your business running like a well-oiled machine. Stay tuned for more posts about how to refresh, rethink, redesign, and reconsider your business as we enter the new year. Happy decluttering!

news_560,news,Business refresh: Creating a resolutions menu for your restaurant,"Local, plant-based, gluten-free—is your menu ready for the 2020s? Check out these three tips for creating a 2020 menu your customers will love.…",09-01-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/business-refresh-creating-a-resolutions-menu-for-your-restaurant/,"Experts say every restaurant should overhaul its menu once a year, and since we’re entering a new decade, now is a particularly good time to reevaluate and refresh what you’re offering your customers.
Your menu should get customers excited about your food, and in order to do that, you need to really know your customer. What do they want? What is your restaurant’s core brand promise, and what can you do to make that brand feel fresh and exciting for the 2020s while still staying true to who you are? Refreshing your menu is all about getting into your customer’s heads—while also digging into the data on what’s selling, what your profit margins are, and how well you’re managing inventory.
Here are three tips for creating a 2020 menu your customers will love:
Make your menu more eco-friendly
Sales of plant-based foods are up, and two out of three Americans say they’re eating less meat. Climate change is consistently in the headlines, and more and more Americans are aware of the carbon footprint of animal products. That’s why, these days, plant-based eating isn’t just for committed vegetarians or vegans—95% of the people choosing plant-based burgers when they dine out are meat-eaters. The reduceatarian movement is one example of how consumers are changing their eating habits without adopting restrictive diets. Eating local, seasonal food is another popular way to reduce the carbon footprint of your plate.
Take a look at your menu with these trends in mind. How can you highlight the plant-based dishes you’re already offering? Can you add more protein options? For example, if your sesame chicken dish is a perennial favorite, adding sesame tofu as an alternative might be an easy way to appeal to customers looking to cut down on meat.
If you’re already partnering with local suppliers, try listing the farmers or other suppliers you work with to appeal to diners who like the idea of knowing where their food comes from and eating local. You don’t have to become a fully farm-to-table restaurant to highlight seasonal produce or celebrate a great local farmer you love.
Increase transparency on your menu
Transparency is a big issue for all kinds of businesses these days—why not bring it to your menu? The two easiest ways to do this are by carefully listing ingredient details for all your dishes, and by offering caloric information.
Read up on best practices for reducing allergen contamination and avoiding cross-contact so that you can be clear on your menu what foods are safe to eat for people with various allergies. Train your wait staff to ask questions about allergies and make notes in the system that cooks can double-check as they prepare food. In the Clover POS, you can easily set up items with “Gluten Free” or “Peanut Allergy” modifiers, and then front-of-house staff can use those when inputting orders.
Adding calorie counts to your menu is another option for increasing transparency. Think through how your menu will look to a health-conscious diner: do you offer a variety of lower-calorie options, or are healthy eaters stuck with a salad? If you’re able to highlight some mouth-watering dishes that can be eaten with a clear conscience, you’ll build loyalty and encourage repeat visits from diners who are looking for healthier options. Again, look for ways to make simple modifications that will broaden the appeal of your signature dishes. If customers love your burgers, why not offer one in a lettuce wrap for low-carb or gluten-free eaters, or a smaller size that reduces the calorie count?
Review your inventory and ordering processes
Of course, while you’re refreshing your menu from your customer’s perspective, you’ll also want to reevaluate each menu item from a business perspective. Use an app like Clover’s Main Street Insights to figure out which items on your menu sell well and which are rarely ordered. Compare your ideal food costs to your actual food costs to help you identify how much food you’re wasting. Use an app like SimpleOrder to optimize your inventory management.
Experts say that good menu engineering—costing out every menu item and designing the layout of your menu to highlight your most profitable dishes—can boost your profits by 15%. It’s well worth doing the math to figure out which dishes you want to highlight in 2020, and which won’t make the cut for your new menu.
Summary
The start of a new decade is a great time to review your menu and do a full overhaul. Getting your menu ready for the 2020s means understanding your customers, keeping on top of food trends, increasing transparency, and reevaluating every menu item to make sure it’s boosting your bottom line as much as possible. The end result should be a menu that looks and feels fresh, entices customers to try new dishes while reminding them to enjoy their favorites, and helps your restaurant start the new year off profitably.

news_561,news,Redesign your mental model: Forget resolutions and reshape habits,"Most of us resolve to change things up in the New Year. But wanting change isn’t enough. For lasting change, we have to reshape our habits. This year, forget resolutions. Instead, answer five questions to reshape your mindset and your habits. …",14-01-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/redesign-your-mental-model-forget-resolutions-and-reshape-habits/,"Welcome to 2020!
After popping a few corks and singing “Auld Lang Syne,” most of us resolve to change things up in the New Year—whether it’s a change in our businesses, homes, or selves. But as long as humans have made resolutions, they’ve also been dropping them—and fast.
This Business Insider poll, for example, found that about 80% of people who made a resolution in January 2018 had dropped it by February—of the same year.
Why do we drop resolutions so fast? Are we making impactful and realistic resolutions? Are we solving the real problem? Are resolutions even worth making after failed attempts at keeping them year over year? Maybe resolutions aren’t the best approach.
It’s simply not enough to resolve to make change. Lasting change is only possible if you’re willing to sleuth out the root cause of the problem behavior you want to change and reshape your habits.
So forget resolutions. Consider, instead, five questions you can ask—and answer—to reshape your mindset and your habits.
1. What are your goals?
Change starts with knowing what you need to change. And for small business owners, changing your business often means changing your own habits.
Start by asking yourself a few questions:

What do you envision for the “new” you in the New Year? More patience with your employees and customers? More work/life balance? More self-care? Better delegation?
What do you envision for your business? Higher profits? More transaction volume? Greater customer and employee loyalty?

Remember, keep your goals simple, and set a manageable number of them. Set three key goals for the New Year.
2. What behaviors keep you from reaching those goals?
The key to setting and meeting goals is self-evaluation. And the key question to ask here is: What’s keeping, or could keep, you or your company from meeting the goals you’ve set?
Start with yourself.
What do you want to change about your behavior? Have you received feedback from others about something you habitually do that negatively impacts your business or those around you? How does that behavior keep you from meeting your personal goals?
If you don’t have a clear sense of what you need to change, ask someone you trust: a family member, a friend, a colleague, or an employee. Be open to feedback. Look for themes. And, remember, honest feedback can be tough to process, so be patient with your confidants and yourself as you sort through their suggestions.
Make a list of the unwanted behaviors you or your confidants have identified. Use a spreadsheet, notepad, or any tool you’re comfortable with and capture all the behaviors you want to change, and thoughts you might have about where those behaviors come from..
Now consider your business.
What is it about your business’ performance you want to change? Do you know how it’s actually performing? If not, use your sales data to get a feel for the health of your business—which days or months your sales go up or down, or how much demand there is for your products and services. Take an honest look at the weak spots in your business because they can point the way to opportunities for growth and change.
Not sure where to begin? Connect with customers and employees to see how they’re feeling about the business and what might be holding it back. Prepare yourself for tough answers.
Self-reflection isn’t easy, but it can help you and your business determine what’s holding you back from being a better you or a more productive business.
3. How are you using your time?
You’ve probably heard about the myth that says it takes 21 days to change a habit. It’s true, indeed, that change takes time, but it usually takes longer than 3 weeks. In fact, changing a habit can take 2 months, on average, and sometimes longer. So how you and your business use time becomes critical to change.
Interestingly, one survey discovered that business leaders were wasting up to 30% of their workweeks on low-value and no-value activities, like emails, checking social, or watching YouTube. To avoid that pitfall and set new behaviors, it’s crucial to take stock of how you spend your time—inside and outside business hours.
Where are you spending the bulk of your time? On high-value items like building your business, spending time with family, or improving your wellbeing? Or on low- or no-value activities? Ask yourself where you’d like to spend more time if you could, or what advice you’d give to a fellow business owner.
Now, take a look at how your employees use time. Pick a time period that’s typical of your business cadence—maybe it’s the last 30, 60, or 90 days—and pull time sheets. If you don’t use a time tracker for your business, check out Homebase Schedule and Time Clock. They work together to help business owners simplify scheduling, time tracking, and even hiring.
If your current time tracking doesn’t offer the detailed breakdown you’re looking for, talk to your employees. Let them tell you how they’re spending valuable work time. Cross reference their reports against their hours and the actual work performed. It’s possible that your team might be doing things that they consider work that actually hinder your progress or efficiency. Identify these undesired behaviors and understand that they may be separate from time-wasting activities.
The goal here is to understand how much time you and your team spend on low-value tasks, tasks not directly related to building your business, and to identify what can be streamlined, trimmed, or even cut entirely.
4. What leads to undesired behaviors?
Once you have a list of all the undesired behaviors and time-wasting activities that keep you and your business from reaching goals, capture possible causes of those behaviors.
Let’s say, for example, one of the behaviors you want to change is your short temper at work. What’s causing that short temper? Is it a carry-over from stress at home, a lack of exercise, poor nutrition, too little sleep, too many errors at work that need your attention?
Next, figure out what’s driving your unwanted behaviors by journaling your activities for a week or so. Be sure to note times that are especially stressful or when your goals aren’t met. Look for trends—day of week, time of day, or time of month—that may need extra attention.
Do the same for your business. Ask your employees to spend a week writing in a journal how they spend their days and where they run into time sucks. Or encourage total transparency through an anonymous employee survey.
5. What habits would set you up for success?
Rather than focusing simply on banishing an unwanted behavior, zero-in on its underlying causes. And work on changing those.
Imagine you’re trying to correct the behavior of eating too much fast food. Rather than simply telling yourself to eat less of it, consider instead the root cause and deal with that. Say, through your self-evaluation you’ve realized you eat fast food because you’re too tired to cook at the end of a long day of work and you often have nothing that’s quick to prepare in your kitchen. So focus on what you can do to prepare meals ahead of time. Can you take a morning, weekend afternoon, or evening to shop for and prepare simple meals that can be at-the-ready for you on long workdays? Can you hire someone to prepare and freeze nutritious meals that can be heated quickly at the end of a long day?
Getting to the root of the problem makes it easier and more likely for you to meet the goals you set for yourself.
When it comes to business, consider how you can set you and your team up for success. If, for example, you find that your team tends to get stressed out and short with one another during the peak-hour rush, try working in a 10-minute fresh-air or quiet-time break for each team member before the rush. That way, each person can diffuse any residual tension from earlier in the day or week before the crunch sets in.
Or maybe you’ve found that last-minute urgencies are running havoc with your schedule. Address your planning systems, so you can get ahead of the curve on big tasks—whether it’s inventory, food prep, marketing, or another task.
Or maybe you’ve realized that you need to nurture a deeper relationship with customers. Consider introducing a tool like CE suite to enhance communication with people and reward your VIP’s.
Summary
At some point, each of us will feel the pain of stress, too much to do in too little time, or customer dissatisfaction—especially small business owners. And each of us has behaviors that could use a little change-up. So let this New Year bring you the opportunity to ditch plaguing habits and make real change. All it takes is desire, thoughtful planning, and practice to make real change for you as well as your business.

news_562,news,Recession-proof your business: Mixing it up,What kinds of goods and services could you offer if your best-sellers no longer sold? What could you do with your space if you shifted things around in your store? How would you increase sales even if foot traffic dwindled? Business is fickle. Here are 6 ways to future-proof yours.…,21-01-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/recession-proof-your-business-mixing-it-up/,"Want to future-proof your business? Plan for all scenarios—both for growth periods and in downturns. While all businesses struggle in downturns, small businesses tend to get hit harder. Consider the Great Recession of 2007-2009, where small business jobs fell 39% faster than at larger companies, and the failure rate of very small businesses (fewer than 5 employees) jumped 500%.
During an economic downturn, consumers are more price sensitive and tend to spend less. Customers today have a lot of choices, and the key to managing a recession successfully is to offer them something they can’t easily get elsewhere. Whether it’s a special experience, in-person advice, or a little of both. Small businesses who have a good plan for pricing and cost issues, fluctuations in cash-flow, and steep competition have a stronger chance of surviving. Ready to take action? Here are 5 actionable tips to future-proof your business against slowdowns.
1. Manage inventory wisely
Research shows one powerful way small businesses manage fluctuations in sales is to reduce inventory. Certainly, selling off slow-moving inventory can help with cash flow, but that’s just the beginning. Simply putting things on clearance until they are gone won’t get you the biggest bang for your buck. Managing inventory is as much about taking advantage of upswings and introducing new products as it is getting rid of the old.
Consider first what led to slower sales in previous cycles, or imagine factors that could impact you down the road. Is your pricing model competitive? Are your top-selling products tied to a particular fad or trend that might become obsolete? Do you need to attract new customers? Inventory management apps can help you track inventory real time and show you trends over time, so you can make informed choices about your pricing and marketing based on your existing sales data.
If you’re considering promotions, there are other questions you can ask yourself: When did sales slow down? Who is still buying specific products? Who is more likely to buy if you have a promotion? Which product sales bring in the highest return? These questions give you insight into what kinds of promotions to run and how to stabilize your cash flow even when your best customers become price-sensitive.
Inventory management software can also help you adapt to changing preferences. For example, you can easily set up a new product or add modifiers so that customers can get exactly what they want. Adapt your best dishes to be dairy free, Keto friendly or vegan. Break up services like a haircut and blow out. You want to keep customers moving through your doors, even if they aren’t spending at the levels they used to. Modifiers can help customers who are watching every penny stay engaged with your business even if they have to scale back. And hopefully, when the economy turns up, they will start to spend more again.
If you’re throwing a sale to get rid of excess inventory, take the opportunity to entice folks to buy other things as well. (Psst… here are some tips for running a successful promotion.) Offer people who buy the overstock a discount on other products that will bring you a bigger return, or possibly a discount on a future visit in a specified time frame. Bundling products together helps the customer rationalize their spending (after all, they’re getting more for their money). Inventory management software helps you bundle things easily, and will keep track of your inventory so you don’t run out of stock.
2. Give new life to your products with creative bundles
Speaking of bundling, there’s no reason you have to stick to overstock. You can take two popular products and bundle them together to make them more attractive. Even popular products can get more mileage if you repackage them.
If you run a coffee shop, offer a commuter special by bundling a baked scone with your customer’s morning coffee at a slight discount. If you run a beauty salon, bundle together makeup, a mani-pedi, and updo for the entire bridal shower. If you run a bookstore, make gift basket bundles that represent your local history, combine useful cookbooks, or pull together puzzle and activity books to comfort people when they are recovering from an illness.
Gift cards are another great way to offer more value and keep the income streaming in. Offering a $5 gift card with your overstocked items can entice people to spend more. Even better, instead of training them to expect lower prices, you’re offering them just enough value to rationalize buying something else without eating too much into your profits. Use Clover’s small-business CRM to design a promotion that will keep customers coming back.
3. Partner with other local businesses
Consider whether you can partner with another nearby business to bundle your products with theirs. This entices shoppers to come to your corner of the neighborhood and helps capitalize on foot traffic that might not have come into your shop otherwise.
Another option is to work with complementary businesses, even if they aren’t in your immediate vicinity. For example, If you’re an antique shop, you could partner with a local hardware store to offer a “remodeling” bundle. You can offer them advice on what pieces fit in with the style home or local history, and the hardware store can offer advice on how to restore the home itself.
You can also work with local businesses that don’t have a physical shop at all. For example, if you’re a quick-serve or counter-service restaurant, perhaps you can work with a party planner to establish a catering practice, with local HR departments to provide food at meetings, or even offer Friday afternoon treats to corporate offices for a special price.
You can set up a reciprocal relationship by offering a 10% coupon to the other store on your receipts. You can also redistribute the discounts for a more equitable profit share. Alternately, you can offer a gift card on a reciprocal basis.
4. Rethink your space
Another way to handle slower periods is to rethink your space and how you can bring more people in. Can a portion of your space be rented out for an event or photo shoot? Consider hosting an auction, charity event (where you donate a portion of profits to a charity), or a preview of upcoming products or services to get your customer base excited.
Here are other creative ways to use your space profitably:

Rent out a pop-up space to a local artist—and take a percent of the profits
Rent your QSR or restaurant for a party or celebration
Book a special event like a meeting, book signing, or conference
Rent your space to local photographers for photo shoots during off hours

5. Offer bulk sales
Got a lot of stock you need to move quickly? Think about who might be interested in buying in bulk and how you can market to them.

Schools—Include teachers, parent-teacher organizations, and student clubs.
Businesses—Would your products make good gifts? Perhaps you can sell in bulk as an employee appreciation gift.
Event planners—Market your inventory as party favors.
Realtors—Realtors often give special mementos to homeowners to be memorable. Offer them a discount.
Care centers—Hospitals, senior centers, and other care centers may be interested in offering your products or services to patients.

Worst-case scenario, ask your accountant if you can donate excess stock to a charitable organization and take a loss against your taxes.
Think about your business creatively
Efficiency is crucial to running a successful business, but sometimes it’s more important to step back and look at your business holistically, asking a bunch of what-ifs. What kinds of goods and services could you offer if your best-sellers no longer sold? What could you do with your space if you shifted things around in your store? How could you increase sales if foot traffic dwindles?
Business is bound to ebb and flow, and preferences and needs will change. Planning ahead for recessions and economic downturns helps you respond quickly to sudden changes and keep fluctuations in perspective. Be nimble and flexible. It’s the best way to future-proof your business.

Introducing our Meet the Merchants—a Q&A series where real Clover merchants share the secrets to their success and how they use Clover to grow. Check out our first Q&A with Ludwig’s German Table in San Jose, CA.…",30-01-2020,https://blog.clover.com/meet-the-merchant/meet-the-merchant-ludwigs-german-table/,"We’re launching Meet the Merchant—a Q&A series with real-world Clover merchants. We share best practices, lessons learned, tips for getting the most out of your Clover POS system, and more.
Meet Nicole Jacobi and Ben Bate, co-owners of Ludwig’s German Table in San Jose, California. Both are immigrants: Nicole hails from Germany, Ben from England. They joined forces to open Ludwig’s in 2016. Since then they’ve flourished in their original location, with plans to expand to a second restaurant in Mountain View. As first-place winners of the CloverAchievers contest, the Ludwig’s team has leveraged their Clover system in several ways to help the business grow. Here’s their story.
 
Ludwig’s German Table: The Origin Story
Clover: How did the idea for Ludwig’s German Table come about?
Ben Bate: Nicole and I met through my brother-in-law, by chance. I just moved to America and Nicole ran another business, running the cafe at the local children’s museum. We started talking and I did some work in her kitchen. One day she asked me whether I had any interest in starting a biergarten. We went and looked at a historic location, the King Conservatory of Music. Nicole had a friend that was part of the club that owned the building. It just felt right and we went for it. We signed a 10-year lease and opened up Ludwig’s.
We designed it ourselves and installed the beer draft system. Here we are three and a half years later. We’re in the process of opening a second location in an area with more foot traffic.
 
“Using Clover has definitely helped our business.
We’ve gotten such good support.” 
 
C: What have been some of the challenges of setting up a biergarten in a California town?
BB: Apart from the obvious like finances and staffing? We’re [neighbors with] companies like Google and Facebook who can pay dishwashers a lot of money and can give health benefits to their families. It’s extremely expensive to give healthcare to a large group of people, so we try to attract good people and incentivize our staff in other ways.
But beyond staffing, one of the tougher parts about opening a biergarten was trying to get customers to accept communal dining. In Europe, it’s pretty normal to share your table with strangers. When we first opened, trying to get people to share their table was hard, and we only had two high-tops that fit two seats each. People used to wait for those two small tables, and only the larger groups were sitting at the communal tables.
But we stuck to our guns. This was part of the dining atmosphere we wanted to create. Communal seating encourages conversation. We didn’t want a cookie-cutter, sterile restaurant environment where you get rushed out. We wanted people to sit and enjoy themselves. We have a selection of board games for people to play together, which gives Ludwig’s a bit of an English pub feel too.
Eventually we got rid of those smaller tables and made everything communal. Now people love it! We had a group of 30 just last night.
C: What was the easy part?
BB: Don’t think there was an easy part (laughs).The easy part was that it came naturally for me and Nicole. We wanted a space where people could come and celebrate and make their memories. So that bit comes easy.

Delivering a great dining experience, family-style
C: How does Ludwig’s German Table fit into your local community? What impact do you feel the restaurant has?
BB: We’re on the residential side of downtown San Jose in a historic building. We’re a little bit off the beaten track, which has ups and downs obviously, but we have a number of regulars. We’re building a family here. They come on their birthday, or they come when they just need to see someone, or when they need a place that is welcoming.
The whole feeling of community radiates outward from you as the owner. One customer said to me last Christmas: “Ben, you know you built something here and it got me through a hard time. I can’t thank you enough for being here.” That was the moment that I thought: I helped that one person get through a difficult time in his life. If I do nothing else with this restaurant, this is it.
C: You’re known for your passionate dedication to customer service. What does it mean to you when people walk through your doors?
BB: People have such a massive choice in dining options right now. It’s expensive to go out to eat. If they go out, they’re coming out for the experience. I always tell my team: when someone is willing to give us money to spend their time with us, we need to take great care of them. That’s the key—take care of people. If you mess up, be honest about it. Tell them what’s going on, and nine times out of ten that person will come back. It’s that simple.
C: What would you say is your most popular dish?
BB: Wiener schnitzel! Everything is made fresh in-house, including our deserts, the dressings, the sauces. We pickle our own vegetables. I believe the effort that we put into making the simple things good has really helped us, too. Nothing is sitting around getting bad, and nothing comes out of a bag. We get our sausages from a local butcher who has been doing it for 40 years. Those are the kinds of things that allowed us to build such a reputation in a short amount of time.
C: What’s your most popular beer?
BB: The Märzen, which is an Oktoberfest-style beer. Before we offered that, it was the German Pilsner. Another of our bestsellers was the Weltenburger. That’s still brewed by monks in one of the oldest breweries in the world in Bavaria—it was founded in 1050 AD.
 
How Ludwig’s uses Clover POS
C: Nicole has a history with Clover that precedes Ludwig’s. Can you tell us about that?
BB: Nicole took over what was a very basic café at the Children’s Museum, and she actually created a healthy concept café. They scrapped the fryers and put in a rainbow station of colorful fruits and vegetables so the kids could create a bento box of nutritious foods. She used the Clover Station, and it worked really well.
When we started up Ludwig’s, we couldn’t afford a $20,000 POS system. So we brought over the Station and made it work for the new business.
C: What was your first impression of Clover?
BB: It’s very intuitive. For a café the Station terminals worked great, but for a bar where people are running tabs and some customers want to cash out early, we wanted something more mobile. We have great communication with Clover and found the right solution. The service was really one of the biggest things that kept me wanting to work with Clover: that feeling of being taken care of. My opinions being taken into account—I like that a lot.
C: How has Clover performed for you overall?
BB: It’s definitely helped our business. Staying with Clover has paid off, and I’ve gotten such good support.

Clover’s part of the family at Ludwig’s
 
C: You mentioned the Clover Flex. What Clover devices do you have now, and how have you set them up?
BB: Right now we run Clover Dining with four Flex devices and two Stations. The outdoor biergarten is 1,600 square feet. The dining room is 1,200 square feet and the event hall is another 2,000 square feet. So it’s a huge space that we’re trying to cover, and having multiple Flex devices has made a big difference. Before, the server did a lot of running back and forth and that whole process was killing so much time. You forget a pen and have to run back, or someone stops you as you pass. Customers used to get frustrated, and service quality was dropping. That was the key reason I wanted a mobile POS solution. With the Flex guests can check out at the table, which saves so much time.
So that’s how we use the Flex devices, to cover three dining areas. We also have a Station at the bar and another at the rear exit.The bar is a contained space, and the bartender literally stays there most of the night. It makes sense to have a terminal there with a cash drawer underneath. But it also makes sense to have a Station because if you want to look at Homebase and check out employee scheduling, or make changes to the inventory it’s just nice to do that on the bigger screen. It’s a totally different use for the Station.
C: Have you or your staff found specific apps or features they particularly like or use a lot?
BB: We use Homebase [Schedule] for employee scheduling. The staff like it, and I like it. We run our restaurant on Clover Dining, and we also use Inventory.

It’s got to run like clockwork!
 
C: Do you use Clover Scan to Pay? How has it helped?
BB: The Scan to Pay app is brilliant. It’s enabled me to cut my staffing costs and improve service, since we don’t need nearly as many servers on the floor. Now servers can print the check, give it to the customer and spend five seconds explaining how to pay it. You simply pull out your phone, open your camera, hover over the bar code, and it will tell you how to do the rest. It’s so easy.
Scan to Pay also includes the gratuity, so servers at the end of the night don’t have a lot of checks they need to go through. It’s already done. The customers find it intuitive to use and they’re enjoying using it.
I love the Flex, I love Scan to Pay, they’re both great. I always wonder why no one else has done it, or done it sooner. In Europe we’ve had tableside and mobile payments at restaurants for years. I’m happy that Clover did.
 
“Scan to Pay is brilliant. It’s enabled me to cut my staffing costs and improve service. And it’s so easy.”
 
C: You’re opening a second location. How’s that coming along?
BB: Yes, in downtown Mountain View, California. We’re still putting in plumbing, but it’s a gorgeous location and a prime spot for foot traffic. The sunsets there are perfect for outside dining. The street shuts down often for arts and crafts and wine festivals. It’s perfect for outside drinking and dining.
This second location is smaller but foot traffic is better, and managing the space is going to be a lot easier. We intend to use the Flex on the floor and have a few terminals at the bar. We can’t wait.
Make your restaurant unforgettable. Discover what Clover can do for you.

Many small businesses struggle with seasonal dips, but creative promotions and seasonal planning can help keep traffic flowing year-round, both in-store and online. Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become holiday juggernauts, but you have the opportunity to take advantage of lesser-known celebrations to create a truly memorable promotion. You could even create your own… isn’t that what Prime Day is all about?
Here are a few upcoming holidays you can make your own. Just remember the golden rule of any promotion: focus on a business goal. What are you trying to achieve, and how will you track it?
Love Your Pets Day (February 20)
Pets are part of the family, and celebrating that special relationship can be a great way to bond with your customers. Make their special buddy feel welcome in your shop. Consider offers like these:

A “goody bag” of treats for your customers’ pets. Increase your ticket size with an irresistible branded gift for pets at checkout. Do you sell toys? Offer a ball they can play fetch with. Do you own a liquor store? Sell a relaxing night for humans and pets—catnip bundled with a bourbon bottle. Local hardware store? Offer a specially built birdhouse where birds can “play” outside their normal cages.
Help an animal in need. Show your customers how much you love animals—round up the bill and send the excess as a donation to animals in need. (CoinOut and Donate at Checkout are great Clover apps that make this easy.) You could also help promote a local pet adoption fair.
Early-bird incentives. Are you a seasonal business like an accounting firm? Avoid the April 15 rush by giving your customers a reason to come in early. Offer a “pet deduction” (a discount for pet owners who come in before Love Your Pets Day). You could also offer a special donation to animal charities in their name.
“Doggie and me” deals. This is for you spa owners out there. Partner with pet groomers to offer a doggie and me mani-pedi special. Encourage them to share their “story” on social media with special prizes for pet-owner pairs that look alike.
Pet-friendly services. Most pets hate vacuum cleaners, which creates a special opportunity for cleaning services. Consider a Spring Cleaning special where you de-hair (or de-feather) a home while the owner takes the pet out for a treat.

National Employee Appreciation Day (March 1)
Did you know it costs companies up to 33% of a person’s salary to replace them? That’s why so many organizations celebrate Employee Appreciation Day—finding and retaining the right people can be expensive.
Help local companies think past free pizza in the break room. Employee appreciation can be a fantastic way for businesses to really shine. By offering your services to other companies, you can help them care for their own employees while giving your own business a boost.

The 10-minute hand/shoulder rub. For the office employee, carpal tunnel syndrome and “frozen shoulder” are common and can be debilitating. Why not offer a 10-minute hand and shoulder rub to all employees? You can work out a deal with their employer to allow you to travel to their site as a popup.
Free financial review or estate planning. Are you a law office or financial planner? Many organizations offer retirement and other estate-planning benefits. Why not come in for the day and offer (by prior appointment) a quick review of their employees’ concerns? This is a great way to build trust and get word-of-mouth going for your services.
Free tire check or a discounted oil change. Are you an automotive service near an office building? Offer commuters discounted services while they’re at the office. Get them used to the idea that you’re right around the corner… and willing to pick up and drop off so they’re never late to work due to a car breakdown. Clover’s Discount app makes this a snap.
Free trial session. Personal trainer? What better way for an organization to promote their “work-life balance” than to offer classes or personal training sessions with you!

And while you’re at it… don’t forget to show appreciation for your own employees. Turnover can be one of your worst enemies and eat away at profits. Here are some other suggestions for rewarding employees after the holiday rush.
National Get to Know Your Customers Day (April 18)
Want to improve customer loyalty this year? Learn how to engage your customers by finding out what makes them tick. Clover apps like Feedback help you gather customer insights discreetly. All you have to do is download the app and you can start getting to know your customers better.
Don’t just ask customers how you’re doing as a business. Start a conversation. Whether using the app or chatting with customers, ask open-ended questions like:

What’s the best thing your stylist ever did for you?
What are your financial goals for the next 5 years?
What would get you to try our VIP services?
What’s your best memory in our store?
What would make it even easier to shop with us?

Once you know what customers want, you can offer targeted promotions using Clover’s Promos app to inspire loyalty and repeat business. Here are more ideas on getting to know your customers.
Above All
Don’t get overwhelmed by the possibilities. Choose one promotion that sounds like it could work for your business, either thematically or because it falls during a naturally slow period, and do it well. Take the time to advertise it in advance and set up promotion tracking so you know how well you did. (Psst… here’s more advice on How to Run a Successful Promotion.) Once you’re done, ask yourself these 5 questions to determine whether it’s worth repeating. And remember, Clover’s in your corner.

Host a party. Have you considered renting out your space for special events? Encourage businesses to use your space to throw a cocktail or even a dinner party for their teams.

And while you’re at it… don’t forget to show appreciation for your own employees, especially after a busy rush period. Turnover can be one of your worst enemies and really eat away at profits. Take a task your employees like the least or that typically takes a long time, and do it for them. This might be things like cleaning out the grease traps or staying late to close up. Offer to do some of these things for them on occasion and give them a break. Here are some other suggestions for rewarding employees after the holiday rush.
National Pi Day (March 14)
Pi day is not just for mathematics fans and bakeries! (Although, if you are a bakery, offering pies at a discount is totally on point.)
Here are a few ways to celebrate pi day for all:

Sponsor a social media contest. Look for customers who submit the best pi day story. Winner gets a freebie or deep discount.
Host a taste-test. Have a taste test event and have customers vote on their favorite pi-inspired dish.
Bring a few friends. Offer a special discount on larger dishes meant to be shared. Groups should be in a party of three or more to be eligible. After all, pi is 3.1415…
Get creative with pricing. Offer a popular drink special with the price $3.14.
Reward the nerds. Have servers quiz patrons on pi trivia and reward winners with free desert or an upgrade of services.

National Get to Know Your Customers Day (April 18)
Want to improve customer loyalty this year? Learn how to engage your customers by finding out what makes them tick. Clover apps like Feedback help you gather customer insights discreetly.
But don’t just ask your guests how you’re doing. Start a conversation. Whether using the app or chatting with customers ask open-ended questions like:

What would make your mornings even better?
What was your favorite desert as a kid?
What’s your best memory in our restaurant?
What are your favorite dishes to cook at home?
If you could learn to make one thing from our menu, what would it be?
Do you have friends you think would enjoy our cuisine?

Once you know what your guests like and want, you can offer them targeted promotions using Clover’s Promos app to inspire loyalty and repeat business. Here are more ideas on getting to know your customers.
Above All…
Don’t get overwhelmed by the possibilities. Choose one holiday, one promotion that sounds like it could work for your restaurant. Take the time to advertise it in advance and set up promotion tracking so you know how well you did. (Psst… here’s more advice on How to Run a Successful Promotion.) Once you’re done, ask yourself these 5 questions to determine whether it’s worth doing again. And remember, Clover’s in your corner.

news_566,news,How to give restaurant guests more control over getting the check,58% of frequent restaurant diners say a slow payment process has ruined a dining experience for them. Don’t let this happen at your restaurant!…,11-02-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/how-to-give-restaurant-guests-more-control-over-getting-the-check/,"Imagine you’ve had a great meal at your favorite new restaurant. Service was attentive and swift, conversation was pleasant, and your kids managed to behave themselves through appetizers and a main course. Now you’re ready to leave, but it seems to have become impossible to catch that attentive server’s eye. And once they do finally come back to the table, they haven’t brought your check—you have to ask for it. Your kids are getting antsy. You’re looking at your watch. It’s already time to let the dog out. Isn’t everything done by computers these days? How long can it possibly take to print out a bill?
By the time your check finally arrives, the server takes your credit card and vanishes into the back of the restaurant again. When they eventually return, your good mood has soured. Your kids are bickering, and you’re pretty sure the dog will be tearing up the living room at home. You don’t have time to do the math to determine a 20% tip, and you’re not feeling that generous anyway, so you just throw down a couple of dollars and hustle everybody into the car. On your way home, you’re drafting a Yelp review in your head: Sure, the food is good, but the service?
In most restaurants, settling the bill is the last interaction any customer has with your staff. According to one 2018 survey, 58% of frequent restaurant diners say a slow payment process has ruined a dining experience for them.
Don’t let this happen to you! Here are 6 strategies for making the process of paying as quick and easy as possible for your guests and your servers:
1. Accept as many forms of payment as possible.
Long waits aren’t just a people issue—they’re a technology issue. Accepting multiple forms of payment—including cash, checks, credit cards, gift cards, and contactless payments—makes it easier for guests to pay with whatever they have on hand. Clover POS systems are already set up to accept anything from cash to multiple forms of mobile payments. Technology like this can go a long way toward making the payment process frictionless for your guests.
2. Take payment tableside.
As frequent travelers know, tableside payment is already common in many countries around the world. American diners are hungry for the same kind of convenience and security: 72% of millennials and 66% of boomers say they’d prefer to pay at the table if they could. A device like the Clover Flex makes it easy for a server to show patrons their bill and accept multiple forms of payment on the spot, without taking the customer’s card or other payment method out of their sight, and with no further wait required.
3. Let guests pay at a kiosk or tabletop device.
Chains like Applebee’s have been experimenting with this kind of technology for years. Applebee’s has found that allowing diners to pay and even order food themselves increases check averages and even increases tips, thanks to auto-tipping options that nudge diners to pay 20%. If you’re offering a casual or kid-friendly dining experience, consider setting up a device like a Clover Mini as a self-serve payment option.
4. Bring the check automatically when clearing plates.
This strategy works best for casual and kid-friendly restaurants or for lunch service. But, in the right circumstances, it can be a way to create a truly delightful customer experience. Servers can have a check ready when they clear away dinner plates, and can always print a new check if a table decides to stick around for dessert.
5. Use new technologies like Clover’s Scan to Pay.
This new feature from Clover allows guests to scan a QR code on their bill and then pay from their iPhone using Apple Pay (Scan to Pay currently works only with Apple Pay). The Clover system will automatically notify staff that the bill has been paid, so guests can leave right away. With tools like this, guests no longer have to wait for their server to take their card away to process payment and then return it for tipping and signing. Settling the bill becomes a seamless one-step process.
6. Train staff to adapt to each table.
Something as simple as asking each party what brought them out tonight can help a server better understand guests’ needs. Maybe they’re on their way to see a movie that starts in an hour, or they’re celebrating a special occasion. Your staff can tailor the payment experience to each party’s needs. For tables in a particular hurry, train your staff to make a note in the POS system so that front- and back-of-house can work together to get them served efficiently.
The more you think through your process for collecting payments, and the more options you give your guests, the smoother your business can run. Learn about these options and more at www.clover.com.

This practice can transform your mental model and nurture a mindset reset in mere minutes a day.…",18-02-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/redesign-your-mental-model-3-questions-small-business-owners-should-ask-themselves-every-day/,"There’s no getting around it. It’s tough running a small business. Amidst the constant busy-ness of business, SMB merchants are often stressed, time-pressed, and pulled in every direction by things and people demanding attention.
The work day offers little space to think beyond the next minute, little margin for error, and even less room for strategic thought that nurtures a growth mindset. If you’re able to carve out even a few minutes for reflection, this post will help you use that time to the fullest.
How mindset affects your success
Why does mindset matter? Because it predicts achievement, as Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck discovered.
In one study she conducted, Dweck offered children a choice: either redo an easy jigsaw puzzle or try a harder one. Some children chose to redo the easier puzzle to ensure they succeeded. For them, success meant feeling smart. Other children, however, chose to work on the harder puzzle. For those children, success meant growing smarter by tackling a more difficult puzzle. These children demonstrate the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.
In years of research, Dweck has discovered and confirmed that success depends on mindset. It’s imperative that you, as a business owner, take steps to turn your mindset to success—a growth mindset.
How to change your mindset to success
You’re a busy business owner. How do you stay stress-free and create the space and time you need to embrace a growth mindset? Consider redesigning your mental model or thought process about how the world around you works. Transformation can start with a simple habit that takes mere minutes a day, a habit that reshapes your perspective and reawakens the entrepreneurial mindset that inspired you to start your business in the first place.
Whether you think of it as a new habit, ritual, or routine, a change in behavior can set you and your business up for more success this year. This change is as simple as asking yourself three questions.
1. What do I want?
This first of three morning questions serves to remind you what you’re trying to accomplish and why you’re doing what you do.

What drew you to the business you’re in?
Why did you start your business?
What is your favorite part in the adventure of being a business owner?
What does your ideal work day look like?
What do you absolutely love about the job?
What keeps you coming back for more?

This question helps you recapture that inner fire that motivated you to launch your business. Centering your thoughts on that memory can fuel excitement for your day, whet an appetite for the day’s challenges, and inspire even more big-picture thinking.
2. What or whom can I help?
This question refocuses you on your purpose, on whom or what you’re serving, and reminds you how your business connects with your community.
Focus on the day at hand, and consider where you or your team may need the most help.

What decisions will they need you to make for them today?
How can you guide them to use their abilities to maximum effect for the business?
What might your customers need from you today?
What needs exist in your area that your business can fulfill?
Do people often travel through your community? If so, how do their needs different from locals?

Taking a few minutes in the morning to consider how you can best help your team, your customers, and your business sets your own expectations for the day. And it helps you brace yourself for the inevitable and unexpected problems of the day, so you’re not blindsided when problems and people require your attention.
3. What should I focus on today?
This question bridges your new morning ritual to the day at hand. Like choosing an intention for meditation, yoga, or prayer, this question helps you identify a focus and drive your day’s efforts towards that goal.
Try a few different ways to approach this topic with other questions.

What needs to happen for your business to run smoothly today?
What do you want to happen at your business today?
Can you find a balance of priorities that includes both needs and wants?
Can you identify a way to help employees perform better?
Can you solve a business problem you’ve been stuck on for a while?
Is there new merchandise to set out for your customers?

This exercise can help bring more clarity to your game plan for the week. For example, today, you’ll focus on having your team set out new inventory, tomorrow you’ll have the team work on new merchandise displays, and the following day you’ll focus on encouraging the team to point out the new inventory items to each customer that walks through the door.
The wind-down question
One of the toughest realities for business owners is finding time to let go of the day’s busy-ness and wind down.
A simple way to keep your mindset focused on growth and begin to quiet your mind for the day is focusing on the positive outcomes of the day.
Ask yourself: “What was today’s biggest win?” or “What did I learn today?”
Whether you’re in your car driving home, in the carpool line picking up the kids, or in the bathroom brushing your teeth, reflecting on the positive outcomes of the day can help clear your mind of the day’s frustrations and refocus it on the good you accomplished.
And taking a moment to focus on the positive outcomes of the day, even if small, can offer a much-needed mental respite from that nagging sense of frustration or failure that can creep up at the end of a busy day.
Putting it all together
To create a habit, routine, or ritual, engage seriously with your morning questions and answers. Jot them down in a daily journal. Make a voice recording during the morning commute that you can play back to yourself anytime you feel you’re losing focus on your goals. Speak your thoughts aloud in a mirror while dressing or showering in the morning.
Once your morning questions become routine, share them. Help your employees, colleagues, or business partners establish a growth mindset, too, by setting aside time once a day, once a week, or even once a month to discuss morning questions together.
Taking time to practice this new habit can transform your mindset, and, in turn, prepare you to lead your business and your team to the next level of growth.

news_568,news,Recession-proof your business: How customer engagement can be insurance against recession,"In this second part of our series on preparing for a recession, we’re focusing on customer engagement. When times are tough, will your customers support your business? The answer depends on how much goodwill you’ve built by investing in deepening your customer relationships. …",25-02-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/recession-proof-your-business-how-customer-engagement-can-be-insurance-against-recession/,"Recessions, like taxes, are inevitable. They are part of the natural life cycle of a healthy economy; and, while we don’t know when the next recession will happen with any degree of certainty, we do know that recession-proofing your business is an ongoing process that small businesses should take seriously.
In the first part of this series, we looked at how to prepare for a recession by offering unique value, partnering with other businesses, and planning for fluctuations in cash flow. These tactics work across many business types and can be implemented immediately to prepare for whatever the economy throws your way. This second installment will talk about the most important part of your business: your customers.
A recession may be a daunting prospect for you and your business, but when it occurs, it affects everyone. Just as your business feels the pinch, so do your customers. That is why customer engagement is vital to keeping your business in the black until the economy recovers. Customer engagement isn’t just about selling or promoting. It’s a thoughtful, authentic effort to build a steady, reliable community around your enterprise. Here’s how meaningful customer engagement can get you through tough times.
What is a customer engagement strategy?
Experts usually approach customer engagement from two angles: support and service. Your engagement strategy should consider both aspects of the customer relationship holistically. Customer support includes addressing concerns or complaints, but also necessitates looking around your business and seeing the community that sustains it. What value can you provide those populations?
Service involves paying close attention to customer feedback, and not just when an incident occurs. Feedback can help you design marketing campaigns, offer promotions, and fine-tune your offering to help a customer solve a problem or present an opportunity the customer might not have thought about. What can you do to show your customers you’ve got their backs?
How to engage with customers
The support side of customer engagement starts with knowing your customers on a personal level. Clover’s built-in customer management software (including Rewards, Promos, and Feedback) lets you get hyper-focused on creating a great experience for each individual customer. Create customer profiles, track your best customers, and reward them with special, tailored promotions or discounts. Personalized rewards can have a significant impact on customer loyalty—crucial in keeping your business going during a recession. Consider these two data points:

56% of customers are loyal to brands they feel a connection with, while 89% are loyal to brands they feel share their values.
69% of customers will shop at a retailer based on what they get from their rewards program.

However, great customer engagement goes deeper than sales and rewards. Get to know your customers through surveys or customer focus groups to learn what brings people into your store. What unique value do you provide that keeps people coming back again and again? How can you make their lives easier? Don’t be afraid to ask your customers what they value most and how you can serve their needs better.
How can feedback improve customer service?
Feedback is the next step in building your customer engagement. Online reviews and customer surveys can provide you with new insights into ways you can improve your business. You can also use Clover Feedback to solicit information from your customers without having them post publicly on sites like Yelp or Google.
Dive into your reviews to spot any themes or trends. Are customers frustrated by long wait times or slow service? Is it hard to find your return policy, leading to confusion and irritation? See if there are quick fixes you can make to improve service through staff training, clearer policies, or better shift scheduling.
Then, have a plan for diligently responding to customer feedback. Can you task yourself or someone on your staff with winning back a disgruntled customer every week? Sometimes the loudest complainer can become your biggest advocate if you can address their issues proactively. Find someone with a legitimate gripe who seems reasonable, and try to handle their issue with care and concern. Bad reviews can become assets, rather than liabilities, when managed properly.
Check out some of these resources on the Clover blog for handling customer feedback:

How can a business help the community?
After sending personalized rewards and addressing individual feedback, it’s time to think bigger. Full customer engagement requires looking past your storefront to see how you can get involved with your local community.
Think about the specific communities in and around your location. Schools, teams, museums, food banks, churches or mosques, and charities all need a little extra help during a downturn. Does the same little-league team or Girl Scout troop frequent your pizza parlor every Tuesday night? Is there a local poetry slam group or some other casual organization that’s found a recurring home at your establishment? What about a local law firm that buys office lunch every Friday for the team? Keep your eyes peeled for natural communities like these and cultivate them purposefully. You can support emerging communities by offering special group discounts or themed menus.
Find easy ways to act philanthropically through your business. The Clover App Market features tools that make it easy for customers to donate to their favorite local cause when they shop at your store. Here are some apps that make it easy to give back:

Round Up for Schools: Allow your customers to round up their purchase to the nearest dollar. The donation goes to support a classroom request from a local teacher on DonorsChoose.
Fundraiser Donation Counter: Participate in charitable missions or fundraisers by expressing a fundraising goal and indicating what percentage of sales goes to a charity.
360 Donations: This donation kiosk app runs on a Clover device and is meant to be left semi-unattended so customers walk up and donate themselves. Set it up in your store, or even at a conference to trade show to encourage donations outside of normal business operations.

Seek out partnerships. Work with local organizations of other kinds, including businesses that complement your own. If you’re a pizza parlor open late at night in a college town, why not offer a student discount and an extra free topping during finals week? Partner with a local bakery to serve cookies for dessert, or maybe coffee to fuel a late-night study session.
Be a good neighbor when a serious problem hits. If bad news impacts your community directly, think about what you can do to lend a hand. If a big local employer lays people off, consider offering a small discount for the newly unemployed. If there’s a natural disaster in your area, pitch in where you can to make a difference. Don’t price gouge during or after a natural disaster: for instance, there’s nothing worse than a store selling an electric generator at 5x mark-up following an earthquake or hurricane. Taking advantage of those hit hard by forces beyond their control will destroy any goodwill you’ve built up over the years.
The good news is that all recessions eventually pass. It’s your job as a business owner to stay in business until they do. Customer engagement is valuable in every economic cycle—in good times and bad. It’s worth investing in for the long haul.

Remodel your financial habits, revamp your tax planning strategies, and take the pain out of next year’s tax prep with these judgement-free tax tips.…",03-03-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/redesign-your-mental-model-use-tax-season-to-build-better-habits/,"That madcap time of year we call tax season is here with a vengeance. Not all of us handle our tax planning the way we know we should, and for some, those yearly financial procrastinations have come home to roost.
We’re here to help you redesign your financial mental model—especially when it comes to tax planning. With these tax tips, you can revamp your financial habits and remodel your tax-planning strategies to take the pain out of next year’s tax planning.
When does tax season start? (and when does it end?)
Assuming a company’s fiscal year aligns with the calendar year, the tax season start date is January 1. By the end of January, inventories should be counted and W2s and 1099s should be sent out. This year, the filing deadline for corporations and LLCs is March 16. Sole proprietors have until April 15 to file their taxes. Get the scoop on deadlines for your 2019 taxes, or, if you’re struggling to stay on schedule, learn about filing an extension and whether your business qualifies. Each state has specific year-end tax filing timelines, so be sure to check your state’s department of revenue policies.
How long should I keep my tax records?
How long your business keeps its tax records depends on its filing situation. For businesses that file taxes regularly, the general consensus is to keep tax records up to 7 years. This article offers a summary of basic record retention rules. The IRS has specific guidelines on the matter.
What receipts and information do I keep for tax purposes?
For a business expense to be deductible, it needs to be “ordinary and necessary,” according to the IRS. You must keep receipts for anything you claim as a business expense. Take a look at these tips for staying on top of business expenses throughout the year so you save all the right information and paperwork without creating clutter.
Financial habits to lessen the pain
Most tax-season pain points can be lumped into a few categories most of us can relate to. Let’s address three of the most common tax-time problems—and ways to resolve them.
Problem One: Time

Complaint: “This task is too time-consuming and manual.”
Solution: Automate or delegate it.

There’s never enough time, it seems—especially for small business entrepreneurs. Expand your mental model to address this issue without having to do everything yourself. When it comes to tax prep, any task that’s repetitive, administrative, or simply takes you away from your core business strategy is a great candidate for automation or delegation.
Move the task off your plate by asking a few simple, if tough, questions:
1. What’s this task actually costing you?
Your time is valuable—especially as a small business leader. So, before you launch into detailed tax prep yourself, consider what an hour of your time is worth. Then determine just how much time the task actually takes: minutes, hours, or days? Is your doing that task really worth what it’s costing you to do it? Consider investing that time in something else with greater ROI or meaning.
2. Is your expertise needed to get it done?
Almost every task necessary to run a small business requires some know-how to complete. But not every task requires the level of expertise and know-how you possess. Think about the task at hand and the team you’ve hired. Could one of your employees tackle that task as well or even better than you, maybe at a lower cost? Have any of your employees asked for more responsibility or for a chance to try something new? What’s keeping you from passing the responsibility along to someone else? Keep your eyes open for members of your team to which you can delegate responsibility helping ease your workload and increase investment amongst your staff.
3. Could technology—an app or software—do it more efficiently?
Take a look at the apps and software you already have. Could the technology you have on-hand help? If not, what would it take to find an app or software to tackle the task? Maybe an employee’s time to research and set it up? An initial outlay of cash to purchase it?
Odds are, you’ve said “yes” to one or more of these questions. Even an “I don’t know” opens the door to possibilities. The key to delegating a time-intensive task is to open yourself up to new tactics, let go of hands-on control, and stretch your team in new directions. You might also need to budget some cash to cover the cost of software purchase and setup.
The Clover App Market offers plenty of tools that simplify and automate common tax-related tasks. Many come at low or no cost. Check these out for starters:

Sales Tax Reporting: DAVO Sales Tax is an app that automatically collects, files, and pays sales tax for you, and it comes with a free trial.
Employee/contractor W2s and 1099s: If your business has employees or works with contractors , you likely need to generate a plethora of tax forms just after the holidays. Apps like Gusto, TimeClock by Homebase, and Run by ADP are tailor-made to handle payroll and help you get tax forms out quickly and easily. And they offer either a free trial or a free version.
Business Data: Your Clover POS business data and Quickbooks could be syncing automatically, if they don’t already. Take a look at the Quickbooks app to start you on the path to automated bookkeeping.
Inventory: Simplify your annual and ongoing inventory management with Inventory Plus Plus, a cloud-based inventory management system that supplements your Clover POS with even more inventory-related capabilities, like setting up workflow automation or adding, removing, and editing inventory fields.

Problem Two: Expertise

Complaint: “I know I need to do this task for tax season, but I’m terrible at it.”
Solution: Outsource or delegate it.

You don’t have to be good at everything. You simply need to make sure your business runs as it should, and that the necessary responsibilities are met. When examining your mental model, stay focused on the things you do best and delegate or outsource the rest.
When delegating, start with your team. Determine if anyone has the ability to handle the task at hand. If not, reach out to other professionals. Keep in mind these two rules when it comes to successful delegation:

First, it’s okay to admit you don’t have the time, interest, or knowledge to be the expert at some aspect of your business.
Second, it’s smart to work with people who have different perspectives, abilities, and know-how to keep your business running at its best.

Take bookkeeping, for example. If you’re busy growing and running your business, you probably don’t have time to stay on top of Quickbooks updates, regular bookkeeping tasks, or even tax-related receipts. But that doesn’t mean you can’t keep your business books in order. Consider these ideas:

Use a mobile app like Tiny Scanner to help you and your team capture all business receipts on your smart phones.
Designate someone on your team as “receipt-handler” who collects and uploads all receipts to the accounting system.
Set up a business checking account with a debit or credit card exclusively for business expenses. Separating your personal finances from business funds is the key to accurate financial and tax planning for you and your business.
Hire an accountant for year-round support. If your tax accountant asks lots of questions about how you’ve entered info, get your accountant involved earlier in the tax process. Consider paying your accountant a small fee to double-check your books every month to help keep the numbers cleaner come tax time.

Problem Three: Priorities

Complaint: “This tax-related task is always on my list, but I never seem to get around to it.”
Solution: Prioritize it, or ask someone for help.

For most of us, tax season brings nagging reminders of financial habits and tax planning strategies we meant to jump-start for ourselves. Make sure that your mental model includes plans for growth and stability moving forward. Think about setting up a retirement account, an HSA, or an educational savings plan for example.
Whatever your chosen task is, start tackling it now, while the pain of tax prep is still fresh. Or table it until just after tax season or the down-cycle of your business. Be sure to enlist help getting educated. And remember to automate or delegate the task as much as you reasonably can.
Let’s say your task of choice is to set up an IRA. Consider outsourcing the setup to a financial advisor or use a robo-advisor for an automated alternative. Outsourcing or delegating the management of your IRA helps you reach your financial goals and stay free to do what you do best—lead your business.
The bottom line
As a small business entrepreneur, you don’t have to be the expert in every aspect of your business to create an effective business model or run a profitable company. You just have to be open to a mental-model redesign and know where and when to borrow brains.

news_570,news,Recession-proof your business: How to manage irregular overhead and cash flows,"Recessions create massive uncertainty for business owners. Consumer spending slows when people lose their jobs, or even fear they might. But a recession can also create other unexpected bumps, including slow-to-pay clients and issues with suppliers. 
…",10-03-2020,https://blog.clover.com/better-business/recession-proof-your-business-how-to-manage-irregular-overhead-and-cash-flows/,"As a small business owner, you’re in control of a lot of things. You hire and fire staff, set the marketing budget, choose your suppliers, and make a host of other decisions, big and small. But there are plenty of things you can’t control that can have a massive impact on your business—like the state of the global economy.
Recessions, in particular, create a lot of uncertainty for business owners. You won’t know how long the downturn will last, how deep it will get, or what types of businesses will be hit the hardest. Of course, the first worry for any business is that revenue will slump when the economy starts to contract. Consumer spending slows when people lose their jobs or even when they fear they might. But a recession can also create other unexpected bumps, including slow-to-pay clients and issues with suppliers.
While you can’t control what happens to the economy, you can control how well you prepare for the unexpected. Here are 6 ways to recession-proof your business:
1. Challenge: Sales start to dip.
Consumers cutting back on their spending is the first and most obvious effect of a recession. Different industries will feel the pinch at different times and in different ways, as people cut out what they think of as luxuries first. Regardless of their industry, a business owner should think about diversifying their customer base. Relying on a few big customers or a single demographic—whether it’s new parents or business lunch meetings—carries a certain amount of risk in stable economies, but becomes even riskier in a downturn.
Solution: Build up your cash reserves. It’s common financial sense that you should have emergency funds in your personal bank accounts; so should your business. Aim to have enough cash on hand to cover at least three months’ worth of expenses, including payroll.
2. Challenge: Big customers are slow to pay invoices.
If you work with corporate customers, or you’re a service business that invoices clients rather than collecting payment at the point of sale, you’ll likely find that those payments start to slow down in a recession. Make sure you’ve got a solid system for not only invoicing promptly but also following up with reminders on a regular schedule. A recession is also a good time to revisit your late fee policy—if you don’t charge them for paying late, should you start? If you do, should you forgive late payments from loyal clients?
Solution: Apply for financing before you need it. The best way to prepare your business for delayed payments is to have financing on hand before you find yourself in a cash-flow crisis. A line of credit or another flexible financing option, like an advance on future payments, could be a real lifeline in a recession.
3. Challenge: Revenue projections become uncertain.
From a business perspective, the hardest thing about a recession is the uncertainty. You don’t know when or how quickly the economy will recover, so it’s almost impossible to predict when your revenue will start to rebound. Consider some creative tactics for boosting your foot traffic or fighting seasonal slumps, which may be even more pronounced in a downturn.
Solution: Cut discretionary spending. To recession-proof your business, be very cautious about making large investments in expanding your business or acquiring new equipment. Look for ways to cut your overhead expenses, including rent, utilities, insurance, advertising and PR agencies, and anything else that isn’t directly related to creating and selling your product.
4. Challenge: Suppliers are struggling.
A recession will affect your vendors and suppliers, too. Some will respond the way you would—by cutting expenses where they can, pushing for prompt payment of invoices, and looking for creative ways to build customer loyalty. But not every business will survive a severe downturn. Consider what would happen if you suddenly lost one of your regular suppliers, or if your landlord decided to sell your building. The time to think through those scenarios is now, not when the downturn hits.
Solution: Strengthen your relationships—and build some new ones. Strong relationships will help you weather any storm. If you’ve been a good customer, you may be able to ask for a cost reduction in exchange for continuing that long-term relationship. But a recession is also a good time to look for alternate vendors and make some contingency plans.
5. Challenge: Corporate investments fail.
If your business invests in the market, a slumping stock market will intensify your cash crisis. Investing can be a great way to build up your business’s assets, but you have to align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance. And depending on your age and personal investment goals, the level of risk you’re comfortable accepting on behalf of your business may be different than your risk tolerance in your personal investments. Make sure you set up a strategy that you can stick with when times get tough.
Solution: Diversify your portfolio. Don’t make any sudden changes when stocks are already tumbling. But do look for ways to diversify your corporate investments away from your own industry. It’s always tempting to invest in an area you feel you know well, but because your income comes from your business, you’re already heavily exposed to any downturn in that industry. A diversified portfolio is your best defense against a recession that hits your industry particularly hard.
6. Challenge: Staff morale begins to slip.
In a small business, there’s no hiding tough times from your employees. They’ll know that sales are down or that foot traffic isn’t what it used to be. They’ll probably start worrying about layoffs long before you even consider them.
Solution: Be transparent, and consider layoffs as a last resort. Managing staff morale is crucial to getting through a recession. You don’t have to open up your books to every employee, but do make sure you’re being honest with your staff about the challenges you’re facing. Look for ways to reduce your staffing expenses without actually cutting jobs, if you can. Layoffs are always an option, of course, but your staff will be grateful if they see you working to save their jobs.
Conclusion
Sooner or later, every business has to weather an economic downturn. A prudent business owner always keeps that in mind. The idea is not to let fear of hard times keep you from taking any risks to grow your business, but to think about ways to recession-proof your business in advance, so you’re not left scrambling when consumer spending starts to slide. You may not be able to control the state of the economy, but you can control how prepared you are for a bad quarter or a bad year. Ultimately, recession-proofing your business will give you the confidence to face any kind of economy.

The past few weeks have seen a significant disruption to our lives, work, and the economy, caused by what is now the global emergency of COVID-19. On behalf of my team, I’d like to express our commitment to and solidarity with our merchants, staff, and our extended Clover family, particularly those impacted by the coronavirus. The health, well-being, and safety of our people is the highest priority for us. With that in mind, we’re deploying teams across Clover to put together resources, relief initiatives, and information to help you navigate these uncertain times. We’ll publish this information over the next few days and weeks here on the Clover® Blog.
 
The way we do business has changed
Across the country, life is changing on a daily basis: counties and states all over the U.S. are issuing orders for residents to stay at home and non-essential businesses to scale down operations or close completely. Many of you now find yourselves having to shift quickly from serving customers in your physical locations to making take-out, curbside pickup, and/or delivery services available, and often even setting up brand new e-commerce pages. This is why we’re calling on all of our teams to support you, our merchants, as well as the larger small business community:  

Financial relief: (see below)
Operational support: resetting priorities for our teams to enable them to support you as you navigate the impact of COVID-19 on your orders, payments including Virtual Terminal, customer engagement, staff scheduling, payroll, and other business tasks and expenses
Business resources: putting together timely, useful information on conducting business safely in these challenging times
Customer service: our customer support and business consultants are on standby to answer questions and address concerns

My leadership team and I are also talking to local business owners to understand what we can do to help. We’re moving quickly to provide products and services that help mitigate the impact on your business.
 
Financial relief is top-of-mind but only a first step
Small businesses and their employees have been some of the hardest-hit. One of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 is financial—if your business is ordered to close by your state or local officials, that affects your ability to generate revenue and pay your staff. 
This has been one of our top priorities. We’re working with our bank and reseller partners to alleviate the financial burden that many of you are feeling right now. If you’ve bought Clover devices directly from us, we’ll be in touch regarding financial relief. If you’re working with one of our partners, they will communicate directly with you. 
We have also put together a COVID-19 Business Preparedness checklist and a list of resources on the federal, state, local, and corporate levels that provide financial relief to small businesses. 
 

Keeping your business, employees, and customers safe
Apart from the financial considerations, it’s critical for small businesses continuing to operate that they do so in ways that ensure safety for their customers, workers, and suppliers. This is especially important for sectors that inherently depend on human contact, such as restaurants, food delivery companies and other food-related businesses, the health care sector, and others.
Our team is working on a series of communications on safety and sanitation, including the mechanisms available to take advantage of contactless payments and other forms of conducting business without physical contact. We’ll update this post with links as soon as they’re ready.  
 
We all need to support each other
We’ve shifted the priorities of our internal teams to focus on what you’re telling us you need most: business continuity, financial relief, and risk mitigation. We also have the support of our parent company Fiserv, one of the world’s leaders in global payments and financial technologies. Fiserv’s strength, stability, and resources make it a solid partner in these trying times, and we look forward to making it through this together.
As the situation evolves, especially here in the U.S., we’ll continue to monitor and assess the steps to take to protect our extended Clover family of merchants, partners, and developers. Please stay safe, and take care of your loved ones, your employees, customers, and communities.

Disruptive events like health emergencies, whether localized or more global in nature, can threaten the well-being of your staff and customers—and ultimately your business.
The current COVID-19 situation has brought this fact front and center for many of our merchants. Today, more than ever, it’s critical to work in a clean environment and ensure sanitary transactions that offer your staff and customers peace of mind.
Here we discuss three areas of business operations where you can make immediate changes to provide your customers and staff with a safe, clean experience that puts people first and looks ahead to a more health-conscious way of doing business.
1. Clean your devices and environment well and often.
Keeping your environment clean is critical during active health emergencies—and cleanliness starts with your frontline staff. Take time to train them in these simple and effective ways that help protect them, the work environment, and customers—and lower the risk of contagion.

Wash your hands well and often. Washing with soap and water thoroughly—for about 20 seconds—is key to reducing the spread of germs from person to person. Check out 5-steps to effective handwashing by the CDC.
Keep your POS clean. Regularly wipe down all POS surfaces touched by customers, especially screens and any other accessories. Take a look at this guide on how to keep your POS clean for helpful information about how, when, and what cleaners to use on your Clover POS.
Provide hand sanitizer. Keep a bottle of hand sanitizer front-and-center for customers to self-serve. If possible, have one available as they enter your business to reduce the germs brought in from the outside. And have another bottle near your POS where transactions take place.
Clean all work surfaces. Be sure to wipe down all surfaces in your business frequently throughout the workday. Although they may not be directly involved in a sales transaction, surfaces like doors, door knobs, countertops, racks, displays, and even windows can be high traffic areas for hands. Think carefully about every step of the payment transaction to identify points of contact so you can be sure to include them in your cleaning routine.

The CDC has also provided this handy guide for keeping your work environment and employees clean and safe.
2. Offer non-contact order and payment methods.
Keeping sales transactions more hygienic—and even touchless—is easier now than ever before with a Clover POS. These are the features you have available right now on your Clover POS that can help keep your customers and staff safe.

Contactless payments (aka tap-to-pay) like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay allow customers to pay without inserting or swiping a card into the POS device, handing the card to staff, signing, or entering PINs. Customers can even use their mobile phones to pay when picking up takeout or curbside orders—some restaurants for example, have Clover’s own Scan to Pay enabled. These methods are also fast, so customers and employees spend less time engaged in the sales process and potentially swapping germs.
Learn more in our contactless payment guide, and feel free to download this handy Contactless Payments sign (PDF format) for your customers.
If you or your staff are working remotely, Clover’s Virtual Terminal lets you take payments and run refunds from a smartphone, tablet, or desktop—from any place you happen to be. That means you can conduct business virtually from anywhere. Just log into your Clover Web Dashboard from a smartphone, tablet, or computer and you’re ready to accept payments. You can also take phone orders at your shop, using the Mail/Phone Order tender in Register. This feature is free to Clover POS customers.
If you’re a restaurant or bar owner offering curbside, drive-up or delivery service, you can take phone orders and payments using the same Mail/Phone Order tender in Register to minimize touch transactions. Payments Plus merchants can also use the Phone Sale app to keep hands-on transactions to a minimum.
Modify your signature settings to raise the purchase amount requiring a finger signature as high as you’d like. If, for example, most of your customer transactions tend to run under $100, change the signature setting so that only purchases over $100 require a finger signature. This speeds up transactions and reduces the points of contact with your POS.
Manage tips differently. Did you know that standalone Clover Stations present tip suggestions on screens both you and your customers can see? Reduce hands on your Station by asking customers if they’d like to leave a tip and what amount. Then, simply enter that amount for them. Do note, though, that on a tethered Station+Mini or Station Pro, tip suggestions are only presented to the customer.
Maintain safe space between cashiers and customers. The CDC recommends maintaining a 6-foot distance from others during this period. Make sure that your POS setup lets everyone maintain a safe space. You may find that you need your cashiers to leave a Clover device ready to receive payment on a table and then step back while the customer completes the transaction.

3. If you ship, ship clean.
At Clover, we take customer health very seriously and package every Clover device in a sanitary manner. In addition, the health of our workers in our manufacturing facilities is regularly monitored, and rigorous protocols are followed by all employees.
The very fact that our POS devices have glass surfaces make them a lot easier to clean than keyboards, for example. We therefore recommend using the glass surface of your Clover POS devices rather than physical PIN pads. In addition, be aware that antimicrobial treatments applied to devices are designed to damage the cell walls of bacteria, not viruses, so it remains important to sanitize any surfaces that might be exposed to physical contact.
Please also note that because there is a six-week window between the time a device is manufactured and the time it arrives at your office or store, the likelihood of a device or any of the materials included in the box transmitting a live virus is next to non-existent. You may, however, want to disinfect the exterior of any packages you receive prior to opening.
If you are also in the business of shipping physical products, notably food or materials that are shipped express or in cooler temperatures (see this article), we recommend putting sanitation protocols in place to ensure your shipments aren’t carrying stowaway germs. Make sure that any employee preparing items for shipment carries out those protocols exactly and thoroughly.
Let your customers know what you’re doing to protect them. Place a printed card inside every box you ship to customers to let them know their health and safety is top of mind and that their products have been packed hygienically.
Unfortunately, none of us can guarantee that shipping companies follow the same sanitation protocols and standards we hold. So to put your customers more at ease, consider including a printed label on your packages suggesting ways customers can sanitize the box upon arrival and before opening. This simple gesture demonstrates you and your business are concerned about customers and their experience and could pay dividends later in customer loyalty.
Better safe than sorry
When it comes to the health and safety of your employees and customers, it’s better to err on the side of caution—especially in these uncertain times. Of course, none of us can completely control every aspect of business, life, or the human experience. But if you take the precautions you can to keep every link in your operational chain safe and sanitary, you’ll have done your part to reduce the risk to your community and those you serve.
We welcome any questions you have on how Clover products and services can help you keep your business transactions and products clean.
Be sure to view this important information on COVID-19 Business Preparedness. And, learn more about what Clover is doing to bring financial relief to you and all of our customers during this challenging time.

Obviously, this takes a significant toll on our economy, and small businesses are particularly at risk. The more nimble and adaptable a business is, however, the more likely it is to weather this storm. This post explores options for ramping up your online and delivery orders to help counteract the impact of significantly reduced or completely eradicated foot traffic. You may not know it, but Clover merchants have a number of resources available through their devices and the Clover App Market to accept and fulfill online orders without having to create a complete e-commerce platform.
New Business Models
Depending on the type of business you run, there are a variety of models you may already be adopting to keep things moving along. Because of the ongoing stay-at-home orders issued by various local and state authorities, there’s a surge in online ordering and an increased need for contactless payments and delivery.
For retail establishments, unless you’re also providing food, pharmaceuticals, liquor, or hardware, keeping the doors open is likely not an option for the time being. Many states have ruled that non-essential services must close their doors to foot traffic. However, that doesn’t mean that your entire business has to shutter. Mail order is an option, though the shipping systems are being heavily taxed by higher-than-usual demand. Local delivery is also an option; it serves your community and keeps your business in their top-of-mind when the time comes to re-open. For example, if you have a crafts store, your customers will still be hungry for yarn, paints, and other materials to get creative at home.
Food service has its own challenges right now. Since most areas have banned in-restaurant dining, there’s been a very quick pivot to take-out and delivery services. Many restaurants have streamlined their menus to allow for easier preparation and inventory management with smaller workforces. Even though the challenges are real and immediate, take comfort in the fact that people will always need to eat. Breakfast and lunch traffic is significantly reduced, so if your restaurant usually serves all day, it may make sense to focus your efforts on dinner. You can learn more about this and other challenges restaurants are facing in this crisis here.
You’ve got options for online delivery
If you’re not already set up for e-commerce, the process may seem daunting. The Clover App Market has a number of solutions that can get you on your feet quickly. Take a look at the options below and see which might be the best fit for your business.

The Ordering.app
We’re hard at work on new integrated solutions for online ordering. One is The Ordering.app, now part of Google, which enables restaurants to receive and process orders through a variety of platforms—Google Search, Google Maps, and even merchants’ own websites. We’re partnering with The Ordering.app to make it easier for our merchants to be discovered in Google’s search results. This new feature is currently being enabled for a limited audience, so be on the lookout for an invite from us via email, or an alert on your device guiding you to the sign-up screen.
Menufy
Menufy automatically generates a website from your Clover menu so that your customers can easily order their favorites. Orders, including integrated orders from DoorDash and Postmates, go through your Clover POS, which means they’re also included in your reports. Best of all, after a free 30-day trial, you can set it up so that the $1.50 fee per order is passed on to your customers.
Applova Mobile Order Ahead
Applova functions on a flat monthly fee rather than a commission charge per order. In this time of high-volume online ordering, this model may be more cost effective. Applova also allows you to offer discount codes, create a loyalty program with a digital punch card, and personalize promotions through unlimited push notifications. Once orders come in, they can be set up to go straight to the kitchen printers, allowing your entire workflow to function as efficiently as possible.
Chowly
Do you take orders through multiple platforms like UberEats, Postmates, and others? Chowly works as an aggregator so you can easily accept and process orders from a number of third-party apps. The subscription is a simple month-to-month fee with no contract obligation, and they are offering a 30-day free trial.
ItsaCheckmate
Similar to Chowly, ItsaCheckmate consolidates orders from over 60 different online ordering platforms so that your restaurant can process them swiftly. No more juggling multiple tablets and websites; orders will print out directly in the kitchen. There is a monthly fee, but if you sign up now, your first 30 days are free of charge.
OrderOut
OrderOut is another aggregator for third-party ordering services. It comes with its own printer that you can place wherever is most convenient for you and your team. It has a low monthly fee and integrates seamlessly with your Clover POS system for easy inventory management and accounting.

Finally, in early April we’ll begin to roll out Clover Online Ordering for web and iOS/Android. The intention of a comprehensive POS ecosystem like Clover is to make it easy to integrate with multiple online providers so you maximize your outreach and order volume.
Summary
“Business as usual” may no longer apply to many small merchants in this crisis, but you have options and support systems to help you protect your business and serve your community while supporting your staff. We’re spending our days working on more ways to support our merchants to help you weather the storm.

This post explores options for launching an e-commerce site with Ecwid or BigCommerce to keep business flowing even if you’ve had to close your doors temporarily.…",02-04-2020,https://blog.clover.com/crisis-support/take-your-business-online-quickly-with-clover/,"Earlier this week, we posted an article about how to get your restaurant ready to take online orders through your Clover® device. But it’s not just restaurants feeling the squeeze of this shutdown. If you have a retail or service business, your foot traffic is also likely drastically reduced, maybe even non-existent. Perhaps you’ve thought about bringing your business online, but aren’t sure where to begin. This post details two different options available through Clover to get your store online as quickly and easily as possible: Ecwid and BigCommerce.
Why take your business online
While there is an obvious push to go online to stay afloat right at this moment, there are a number of other benefits to consider. E-commerce can be a smart move for your business not just in the present moment, but also in the long term once physical distancing rules are relaxed. Consider the following:

Remote work is a necessity for most people right now, but even when restrictions are relaxed, it’s great to have options. Having a robust online store means you can continue to manage your business wherever you are.
Customer service may be a cornerstone of your in-person shopping experience, but online stores can offer you a different opportunity to connect with your customers. You may be able to offer live chat support so that you can maintain high-touch relationships with your customers.
Expanding your market is a great advantage of going online. If you are a highly specialized store, you may need to look beyond your local community to find your market in challenging times like these. Having an online storefront allows you to connect with potential customers and clients not just outside of your local area, but anyone obliged to shelter at home.
Receiving orders, questions, and requests around the clock may seem daunting, but it might be easier to handle things this way in the long run. Consider setting aside an hour each day for responding to emails or requests in a batch, rather than on a rolling basis as things come in. This practice streamlines your time and ensures that your customers will get timely and consistent responses.

For more ideas, read our article detailing the first 5 things you should do when opening an online store.
Launching an online store with Ecwid
If your inventory is relatively manageable, Ecwid® is a great option for online selling. The store setup is simple, but includes advanced features to help you navigate issues of closure and distancing policies. The ideal business type for the Ecwid e-commerce platform includes small and mid-sized businesses, including small restaurants.
One of the first things you should do when signing up with Ecwid is download the Sell Online app in the Clover App Market. This app automatically syncs your products, inventory, and orders from your Clover platform to your new Ecwid-powered store. You can add your new store to your current website, or build a new site with one of the many design templates at your disposal within Ecwid.
Once your store is active, Ecwid makes it easy to sell on other platforms: Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, and more. You can schedule curbside pickups or offer a variety of shipping options, and it’s easy to offer discount coupons when you need to spark more traffic. You can even sell gift cards for future use.
Right now Ecwid is offering an extended free 90-day trial so you can get your online business up and running without worry. There’s no setup fee or transaction fees. And if you need help, Ecwid’s support team is available for you via live chat. They also have a live demo in the form of an online taqueria that you can explore. Learn more and get started at www.ecwid.com/clover.
Use BigCommerce to create a robust online store
Another partner we work with is BigCommerce®, ideal for larger, more established businesses, especially in the retail space. So if your inventory is considerable, and/or you have multiple locations, you’ll need an e-commerce platform designed to accommodate them. BigCommerce is a great option if you need your online store to be a workhorse and are willing to put in the time to design and customize it to your specific needs. Ideal verticals for BigCommerce include fashion and apparel, home goods, sporting goods, toy stores, and more.
To get started, install BigCommerce on your Clover POS. Then, you can easily import your Clover catalog into a BigCommerce online store with just a few clicks. You can also accept online payments and view orders using your existing Clover merchant account. As you sell online (and offline when your store is open), your inventory stock counts will stay updated across both your Clover device and BigCommerce.
Like Ecwid, BigCommerce is offering Clover merchants their first 3 months free* on the platform from now until June 30th, 2020.
Summary
“Business as usual” may no longer apply to many small merchants in this crisis, but you have options and support systems to help you protect your business and serve your community while supporting your staff.

This article is published courtesy of Nav, a Clover partner that provides financial tools and resources for small business owners.
The Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) includes a number of programs to help small business owners. There are still details being worked out, but our goal here is to answer common questions about the Paycheck Protection Program Loans that will be made available soon under that law. These loans are a modification of the popular SBA 7(a) loan program for the specific purposes of assisting small businesses affected by coronavirus.
This article has been updated on April 3, 2020 with information from the final interim rule.
Please keep in mind:

This article is not about the Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) which is a separate loan program. Read our FAQs about Disaster Loans due to coronavirus here.
Lenders will begin to accept applications beginning April 3 for small businesses and sole proprietors and April 10, 2020 for independent contractors and self-employed individuals. Nav will match borrowers to SBA lenders and we’ll let you know when these loans are available through our lending partners.

Do I Qualify for The Small Business Stimulus Loans?
To qualify for SBA funding under this new program, you must be a small business as defined by the SBA. This includes:

Small businesses or non-profit 501(c)(3) organizations with 500 or fewer employees
Small businesses, 501(c)(19) veteran’s organizations  or tribal concerns that meet the SBA size standards (See SBA size standards.)
Sole proprietors or independent contractors

Businesses in the food or hospitality industry (NAICS codes beginning in (72) may be eligible on a per location basis.
In addition the normal affiliation rules are waived for franchises or businesses receiving financial assistance from a Small Business Investment Company.
In determining eligibility for these loans, the lender must consider whether the business was in operation on February 15, 2020; and had employees for whom the borrower paid salaries and payroll taxes; or paid independent contractors, as reported on a Form 1099–MISC. An ‘employee’ includes individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis. (Read further for more information about independent contractors.)
I Don’t Have Employees. Can I Still Qualify?
Yes you may. The CARES Act states: “…individuals who operate under a sole proprietorship or as an independent contractor and eligible self-employed individuals shall be eligible. Applicants who fall in this category will need to provide documentation such as “payroll tax filings reported to the Internal Revenue Service, Forms 1099–MISC, and income and expenses from the sole proprietorship, as determined by the (SBA) Administrator and the (Treasury) Secretary.”
What If I Have A Franchise?
Franchises and hospitality businesses (NAICS code 72) with multiple locations, even if they have more than 500 employees, may be eligible on a per location basis as well as any businesses receiving financial assistance from a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC).
How Much Money Can I Borrow?
The basic answer is that the maximum loan amount is 2.5 times the average monthly payroll for the 12 months preceding the date the loan is made, up to a maximum of $10 million.
Use our free CARES Act SBA Calculator to see how much you may be able to borrow. Access the calculator through the Nav app from your Clover Dashboard.
However, if you are a seasonal business, you can apply to borrow 2.5 times your payroll for either the 12-week period beginning February 15, 2019 and ending May 10, 2019, or the period of March 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019.
What if you are a newer business? If you were not in business for the time period beginning on February 15, 2019 and ending on June 30, 2019, then you can use your average total monthly payroll costs incurred from January 1, 2020 to February 29, 2020 and multiply that by 2.5.
Payroll does not include salaries above $100,000 or qualified sick leave pay under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. (See What Does Payroll Include? below.)
Is This The Free SBA Grant Money I Heard About?
No. The $10,000 advance is part of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, not Paycheck Protection Program Loans. Read about Disaster Loans here.
Where Can I Get One of These Loans?
Individual lenders, including many banks, credit unions and some online lenders will make these loans.
Nav will be helping match small business owners to lenders making SBA loans and we’ll notify you when these loans become available through our lending partners.
What Can I Use the Funds For?
You can use the loan proceeds for:

Payroll costs
Costs related to the continuation of group health care benefits during periods of paid sick, medical, or family leave, and insurance premiums
Employee salaries, commissions, or similar compensations
Payments of interest on any mortgage obligation (but not to pay principal or to prepay a mortgage)
Rent (including rent under a lease agreement)
Utilities
Interest on any other debt obligations that were incurred before the covered period
Refinancing an SBA EIDL loan made between January 31, 2020 and April 3, 2020

How Fast Can I Get a Loan?
This legislation was specifically designed to make these loans faster and easier for lenders to approve and fund. (Traditionally SBA 7(a) loans can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months.) The relaxed standards are designed for fast approval, but keep in mind there will be unprecedented demand and lenders must implement the new rules.
How Fast Will I Have to Repay It?
These loans have a maximum term of two years. You can prepay at any time without penalty.
What Is the Interest Rate and Fees?
The interest rate for these loans will be 1% for all lenders that make them. Normal 7(a) loan fees are waived.
Is there a Personal or Business Credit Check?
None is required.
Is There a Personal Guarantee?
No. There is no personal guarantee required. In addition, these will be non-recourse loans as long as proceeds are used for covered purposes. (Non-resource means the government won’t be able to collect if you default.)
Is Collateral Required?
No. Normally SBA loans for more than $25,000 require collateral. That requirement is waived for these loans.
How Soon Do I Have to Start Making Payments?
Payments will be deferred for six months (though interest will accrue).
Do I Have to Prove I Can’t Get Credit Elsewhere?
No. Normally SBA loans require a “credit elsewhere” test to determine whether the borrower can get similar credit at another financial institution. This is waived here.
How Do I Get Loan Forgiveness?
If you get one of these loans, you can request forgiveness of the principal portion of the loan for the eight week period after you get the loan that covers:

Payroll costs
Interest on a mortgage
Rent
Utilities

However, no more than 25% of the forgiven amount can be attributed to non-payroll costs.
Your loan forgiveness will be reduced if you decrease your full-time employee headcount. It will also be reduced if you decrease salaries and wages by more than 25% for any employee that made less than $100,000 annually in 2019. You may also receive forgiveness for additional wages paid to tipped workers.
In addition:

Payroll includes the costs listed under the section “What Does Payroll Include?” below.
Forgiven debt will not be taxable.
The mortgage, rent and utilities covered in this section must be in place before February 15, 2020.

Please note: there are specific and technical calculations included in this section of the law, and you should not rely on this description to determine whether to keep employees, reduce employee wages or to determine your eligibility for loan forgiveness.
Do Independent Contractors Count as Employees?
No. Independent contractors can apply for a PPP loan on their own so they do not qualify for purposes of a borrower’s PPP loan forgiveness.
Can I Apply for More Than One PPP Loan?
No.
What Happens if PPP Loan Funds are Misused?
If you use PPP funds for unauthorized purposes, SBA will direct you to repay those amounts. If you knowingly use the funds for unauthorized purposes, you will be subject to additional liability such as charges for fraud. If one of your shareholders, members, or partners uses PPP funds for unauthorized purposes, SBA will have recourse against the shareholder, member, or partner for the unauthorized use.
Keep good records of how you use these funds. Sloppy record keeping may prove costly!
What If I Have Already Laid Off Employees or Cut Pay?
If you have already laid off workers, you have until June 30, 2020 to restore full-time employment and salary levels for any changes made between February 15, 2020 and April 26, 2020.
Again, you should not rely on this description to determine whether to lay off or hire employees.
What Does Payroll Include?
The CARES Act states that payroll includes:

Salary, wages, commissions or similar compensation
Payment of cash tips or equivalent  (based on employer records of past tips or, in the absence of such records, a reasonable, good-faith employer estimate of such tips)
Payment for vacation, parental, family, medical, or sick leave
Allowance for dismissal or separation
Payment required for the provisions of employee benefits including insurance premiums
Payment of any retirement benefit
Payment of State or local tax assessed on the compensation of employees
For sole proprietors or independent contractors: wages, commission, income, or income from net earnings from self-employment, or similar compensation

It does not include:

The compensation of an individual employee in excess of an annual salary of $100,000, as prorated for the covered period*
Federal employment taxes imposed or withheld between February 15, 2020 and June 30, 2020, including the employee’s and employer’s share of FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) and Railroad Retirement Act taxes, and income taxes required to be withheld from employees
Any compensation of an employee whose principal place of residence is outside the United States
Qualified sick and family leave wages for which a credit is allowed under sections 7001 and 7003 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act

*For annual salaries above $100,000, use $100,000 for the salary of that individual when calculating payroll.
What Do Utilities Include?
Utilities include electricity, gas, water, transportation, telephone, or internet access for which service began before February 15, 2020.
Do Independent Contractors Count as Employees?
No, independent contractors have the ability to apply for a PPP loan on their own so they do not count for purposes of a borrower’s PPP loan calculation.
How Do I Document Payroll?
You must submit such documentation such as payroll processor records, payroll tax filings, or Form 1099- MISC, or income and expenses from a sole proprietorship. For borrowers that do not have any such documentation, the borrower must provide other supporting documentation, such as bank records, sufficient to demonstrate the qualifying payroll amount.
Are There Disqualifiers?
Yes. You are ineligible for a PPP loan if, for example:

You are engaged in any activity that is illegal under federal, state, or local law;
You are a household employer (individuals who employ household employees such as nannies or housekeepers);
An owner of 20 percent or more of the equity of the applicant is incarcerated, on probation, on parole; presently subject to an indictment, criminal information, arraignment, or other means by which formal criminal charges are brought in any jurisdiction; or has been convicted of a felony within the last five years; or
You, or any business owned or controlled by you or any of your owners, has ever obtained a direct or guaranteed loan from SBA or any other Federal agency that is currently delinquent or has defaulted within the last seven years and caused a loss to the government.

What’s the Difference Between the Payroll Protection Act and Disaster Assistance loans?
The CARES Act includes a number of relief programs for small businesses. The one we are focusing on in this article is the Paycheck Protection Program Loans. As part of the new law, businesses will be able to more easily get certain SBA guaranteed 7(a) loans. Borrowers will then be able to apply for forgiveness of certain portions of the loan if they meet requirements by keeping employees on payroll.
The Economic Injury Disaster Loan is a separate loan altogether and you apply directly to the SBA, not to individual lenders.
Can I Apply For This Loan and Disaster Assistance?
Yes, but you cannot “double dip” and get funds from both loan programs for the same purpose. Furthermore, according to the Interim Rules, “If you received an SBA EIDL loan from January 31, 2020 16 through April 3, 2020, you can apply for a PPP loan. If your EIDL loan was not used for payroll costs, it does not affect your eligibility for a PPP loan. If your EIDL loan was used for payroll costs, your PPP loan must be used to refinance your EIDL loan. Proceeds from any advance up to $10,000 on the EIDL loan will be deducted from the loan forgiveness amount on the PPP loan.”
This guidance does not address what happens if you applied for an EIDL before April 3, 2020 but received one after that date.
Can I Apply For This Loan and the Payroll Tax Credit?
There is a payroll tax credit of up to 50% of qualified wages for certain businesses whose operations have been fully or partially suspended by a government order or whose gross receipts in a quarter have fallen by at least half compared to a similar quarter the year before.
Your business cannot receive both the Employee Retention Payroll Tax Credit and a Paycheck Protection Program Loan, so if you are considering both make sure you consult with your legal or financial advisor.
What Can I Do Right Now?
While you wait for these loans to become available there are several things you can do right now:

Gather payroll documentation. You’ll need documents such as payroll tax filings verifying the number of full-time employees on payroll and how much they were paid during the applicable time period. (See “How Much Can I Borrow” above.) If necessary, contact your accountant, bookkeeper or payroll processing firm to make sure you have the documents you need. If you are self-employed, see “I Don’t Have Employees.”
Check your credit. These loans may still require a credit check even if the SBA doesn’t require it to qualify. If you don’t know where you stand, it’s a good idea to check your personal and business credit. You can check your business credit through the Nav app and we will also alert you when our lending partners begin to make these loans and help match you to lenders.
Get clear on your finances. If you have let your bookkeeping fall behind, catch up. You need a clear picture of your income and expenses to make decisions about how your business will weather the crisis. If you hope to apply for loan forgiveness you’ll also need documentation of the expenses you will pay during the eight weeks after you get the loan, including mortgage interest and/or rent and utilities.

Paycheck Protection Program Loans may prove to be a crucial tool helping some small businesses survive this crisis. Although this may seem overwhelming, it’s worth taking the time to find out how they may help your business.

Restaurant owners are getting creative with curbside pickup, themed meal kits, and ways to tip your bartender from home. Here’s how to redesign your menu, stay in touch with guests, and get relief.…",07-04-2020,https://blog.clover.com/crisis-support/covid-19-restaurant-survival-guide/,"Restaurants are among the many small businesses struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guests are staying home and meals are mostly takeout: 92% of restaurant traffic is now outside the dining room, with most states banning in-restaurant dining altogether. We’re facing a long road back “to business as usual,” but there are things your restaurant can do to support your community, care for your employees, and keep the lights on.
Shift your mindset
Before you try to rethink your restaurant workflow, you may need to redesign your mental model. We explored this topic in a recent blog article, but the basic idea is to examine your priorities and set clear intentions rather than functioning only in response to emerging problems or concerns. Running a small business is tough even in ordinary times. Find that conviction, resilience, and strength that brought you to this point. Small business owners are the bedrock of our communities: your family, your employees, and your neighbors will look to you for leadership.
 
Rethink your menu and service offerings
The next step is to find creative ways to use what you have. How can you reimagine your offerings to sustain income while serving your community? Here are some ideas to get you started.

Offer family-style menus…
Modify your menu to offer dishes that travel well, are full of long-lasting ingredients reliably available from your suppliers, and feed a full family. Some restaurants publish a new daily menu each morning to provide options based on ingredient availability. Others are creating freezer-friendly packaging for dishes that are able to be enjoyed later. It’s also helpful to include enough food for leftovers—with reheating instructions of course—as many people are working from home and will need lunch the next day. Specify how many portions come with each dish to help customers assess how much to order.
…and group-sized drinks
Many states are relaxing their alcohol laws during the COVID-19 crisis. New York, New Hampshire, Maryland, Illinois, California, and Texas are just a few places that have all temporarily changed their regulations to allow alcohol delivery, giving restaurants a way to replace lost revenue. Partner with a brewery or alcohol vendor to offer growlers of beer to go. Pair bottles of wine with meals, or pre-mixed margaritas or sangrias with tacos. Alcohol is a great way to increase your restaurant margins and complete a meal for guests.
Offer specialty pricing for certain groups
Some restaurants are earning goodwill by offering discounts or special menus to laid-off industry workers, medical personnel, and elderly people. Specialty pricing gives you an opportunity to use up perishables or ingredients that don’t fit into a newly modified menu. Clear your fridge responsibly by finding ways to help those in need within your community.
Create make-at-home meal kits
Obviously, you don’t want to give away the secret to your special sauce, or your grandmother’s cookie recipe that keeps customers coming back for more. But restaurants can create build-your-own meal kits that still make it easy for guests to enjoy your signature foods. Help families out by creating an ingredient kit for pizza or cookies complete with toppings or other decorating components—not only are you offering a meal service, but also entertainment for kids cooped up in the house. Try a themed kit: brunch party packs, make your own smoothie kits, or an at-home taco bar.
Sell groceries and pantry staples
For those who want a less crowded shopping experience, restaurants can be a lifeline. Sell groceries, unique gourmet items, and pantry staples that you can source directly from your suppliers to offer an alternative way to get food in the house. Groceries also encourage customers to come back frequently, helping your cash flow.

 
Pivot to delivery
Official guidelines for staying at home can change by the day. As foot traffic dries up, here are some tactics to continue serving your guests at their homes.

Switch to online orders or ordering ahead
Pivot to take-out and delivery services to continue serving meals when diners aren’t able to make it to your restaurant. You can ask diners to order meals—especially family-sized portions—at least 24 hours in advance to ensure you’ll have the necessary staff on hand to prepare them. The Clover App Market has many options to get you set up for online delivery and take-out meals: try Chowly, Menufy, or any of the other services. Just enter “delivery” or “food delivery” in the search bar in the upper right. Also, see our recent blog post on how to set up online ordering fast.
Curbside pickup
Curbside pickup is another great option for restaurant guests no longer able to, or choosing not to, dine out. Curbside pickup refers to order pickup by the customer, at the restaurant. Typically the customer will park outside, often in a designated space, while a runner brings the order out to the car. This is where mobile, handheld POS devices—like the Clover Flex—come in very handy.Redesign your take-out protocols to account for customers who won’t be entering your establishment. Encourage repeat visits by adding a “bounce back” card with the take-out meal, offering something special on the customer’s next visit (with a tight expiration date).
Contactless payment
Exchanging payment physically is one of the easiest ways to transmit germs. In the Clover POS ecosystem, all of our devices, including Flex, our mobile POS, have contactless payment built in. Contactless payments are a fast, secure, and hygienic way for your guests to close their tab with a debit card, credit card, or mobile device. Simply tap and go—a great option for curbside or in-restaurant pickup.
Set up an e-commerce site
Set up an e-commerce page or an entire website to give customers a way to order and pay remotely. If you have them, include non-perishable grocery items, like your restaurant’s special sauce, grocery items, or pantry staples, as additional items for sale. Here’s how to set up an e-commerce site that can provide an additional revenue stream for your restaurant.

 
Financial relief
The COVID-19 crisis has forced numerous restaurants and bars across the country to close or downsize. Below is a list of resources you can explore to help stem the cash-flow drain your business might be experiencing.

More ways to stay connected
Just as chefs try to make the most of every ingredient at their disposal, so you can see what other aspects of your business might help you weather this crisis. There are numerous ways to connect with your guests. With a little creativity, you can build or strengthen your connection with your community, and in some cases even lower your costs .

Streamline your hours. Keep costs down by opening only during peak times. We’re seeing some restaurants reducing their hours to 4:30 – 8 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.
Host a cooking class. Have your chef create a video, webinar, or live Instagram video showing at-home cooks how to make some of your favorite dishes.
Do away with extras. Plastic utensils not only present an additional cost, but they’re also bad for the environment. Skip adding disposable utensils to your take-out orders unless a customer specifically requests them.
Throw a virtual dinner party. For those who are in solo quarantine, host a virtual hangout so diners don’t have to eat alone. Be sure, however, that the video conferencing platform you’re using has the proper security protocols in place.
Offer activities for kids. Post fun things for kids to enjoy. For instance, if you’re a seafood restaurant you might think about ocean-themed arts and crafts activities parents can download to keep their kids busy during the lockdown.

Make use of your restaurant’s social media channels and email to stay in touch with customers while your dining room is closed.
Communicate, communicate, communicate
Restaurants thrive first and foremost because of their people. Your team is integral to your success: from your chef and kitchen staff to your hostess and servers, your people make your business. Don’t be afraid to touch on the very real and human side of the COVID-19 crisis when you talk to your staff, suppliers, customers, and the larger community.
Communicate the things you are doing to stay open to your customers and your employees. Transparency is key here: make sure everyone is aware of the steps you are taking to keep everyone safe, from hygiene and sanitation to relief and flexible approaches to work.
Finally, don’t forget that marketing—with an eye toward sensitivity—is still important. Hard sells won’t go over well: many people are struggling economically with the current waves of layoffs. Instead, let your customers know whether or not you’re open, how you’re physically providing meals (through curbside pickup or delivery) and how they can order or support you. This is a time to communicate more, not less.
This is a crisis, but it’s also a challenge, and small business owners are often the first to step up to the plate in times of need. Strategize how you can redesign your menu to make the most of your ingredients, cut down on waste, and support customers stuck at home. Revamp the dining experience. Use your social media channels to create a virtual experience, keep customers connected, and stay in touch as the situation evolves. And don’t forget there are financial relief options out there to support your employees and hold you over until the situation improves.

In our first installment, we talked to cultural sensation Ludwig’s German Table. Just a few short months later, a tiny little virus would turn the world upside down, forcing the temporary—and sometimes, sadly, permanent—closures of countless small businesses. 
We sit down—virtually of course—with Becky Sunseri, the founder of Tin Pot Creamery. Join us as Becky recounts the story of Tin Pot, from its humble beginnings in her living room to a thriving, multi-location ice cream powerhouse, and pulls back the curtain on the series of steps she and her team took to keep their shops open when the COVID-19 crisis hit. Tin Pot is one of the many small businesses impacted by the coronavirus, but their resilience and determination to stay in business embodies the spirit that’s powering local economies all over the United States right now. 
This installment of the Meet the Merchant series is a COVID-19 Small Business special edition.
  
Clover: Where does the name Tin Pot Creamery come from?
Becky Sunseri: The name comes from a really old ice cream recipe. It says to freeze the ice cream in six tin pots… and I like the idea of the tin pot representing something homemade. So we’re going back to the basics of homemade ice cream, with a little spin on it.
Clover: What sparked the idea for Tin Pot Creamery?
Sunseri: It all started when I was a little girl in central Illinois. My mom is a wonderful baker; she would make everything from scratch. She would make home-made bread; instead of cereal we’d have home-made granola. My dad is a composer. Every Sunday morning he’d be in his office (aka bedroom) I wouldn’t be able to interrupt until I stopped hearing music coming out of the room.
So that’s the atmosphere I grew up in. I realized the value of creativity from my Dad, and from my Mom I learned how much better homemade food tastes. I got really interested in the creative side, in flavor pairings. I wanted to create something that combined the joy of food and great ingredients you can feel good about.
After university, I moved out to the Bay Area, and went to pastry school in San Francisco. I worked in bakeries and restaurants and ultimately ended up at the Facebook kitchen. I started there when it was still small; there was only one other pastry person there. I learned so much—how to produce great products at scale, many trials and errors with different foods. If I hadn’t spent time at Facebook, there’s no way I’d be able to open Tin Pot.
Clover: What did Facebook employees think of your ice cream?
Sunseri: It’s ironic because the one thing I never made [at Facebook] was ice cream. I’d bring home the baked goods from work, and put them together with ice cream I made at home, and that’s really how I started to develop the flavors for Tin Pot. I had no idea where to start. I didn’t have any money and I didn’t have a shop location. So I started an ice cream of the month club. [laughs] I sold my first membership to someone at my gym class. And that’s how it started.
Clover: An ice cream of the month club—very innovative! How did you go about growing the business?
Sunseri: I said to myself, this is great but now I have to figure this out! This was in the days before we had all this great navigation on our phones. I would print out all the [customer] addresses, spread them out on my carpet, and move them around to try and figure out how to get to all these places. I would give them a delivery window of three hours on a specific day of the month. Things like that. Long story short, it was a lot of work, but I ended up getting a fair number of customers, from San Francisco to San Jose. I was struck by the fact that people in San Francisco can get great ice cream and they were still buying mine. So I knew I had something extra special.
That was how we were able to get our first location in Palo Alto. The shopping center we’re a part of [now] did a whole beauty contest, if you will, [when they were looking for shops]. When they decided to go with us, they said “We’re taking a leap of faith, but your ice cream is so good, you have a lot of followers who love your product, and we love the idea that you’re from this area.”
So that’s how it all started.
It’s been a really fun journey. We’ve got five scoop shop locations—Palo Alto, Los Altos, Campbell, San Mateo, and our most recent one opened in the Chase Center in San Francisco, where the Warriors play. It was doing really great until all events got cancelled everywhere.

Clover: With your multiple locations, are you doing things differently than you would with a single location?
Sunseri: The more locations you have, the more difficult it is because you have more overhead, things like rent and payroll. We’re lucky because we’re in that sweet spot of not having so many [locations] that it’s unmanageable but having more than one allows us to get more revenue.
We have a kitchen where we make everything and because it’s not far [from our locations] we can distribute our products to our stores on our own—and just once a week if we need to, since ice cream has a longer shelf life than other food products. Some of the stores bake their own cookies so we sell cookies at those locations.
Clover: COVID-19 is on everyone’s minds right now. What was your initial reaction as a small biz owner, in the early stages?
Sunseri: It happened in phases, as I realized the severity of it all. We’re lucky in that we have a small enough team that we can talk often and make fast decisions. There was a meeting where we discussed it, well before any of the shelter-in-place orders. We could see what had happened in other countries, so in that first meeting, we said we should implement extra safety measures and educate our staff. We knew it might come down to store closures but hopefully not… it was still a “just in case” kind of thing. We knew it was possible, but I honestly didn’t think it would come to that. Then we started walking closer and closer to stores being closed, and I started to see it on the horizon.
And as it evolved, day by day, we would communicate to our staff and adjust our business according to [the latest] regulations.
Clover: Walk us through those early steps to weather the crisis.
Sunseri: Before COVID-19, 97% of our revenue came from our stores, and we knew we had to do something else to keep revenue coming in. We had to find a new way to operate. It was obvious from the very beginning that we had to flesh out delivery. We already had one channel set up, DoorDash… so we changed to 100% delivery and pickup. Now we’re on all the delivery platforms: DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub. We’ve also got store pickup so people can call ahead. But these delivery services have a limited delivery radius for frozen products, so having more locations in the Bay Area is helpful for us because we can reach more people.
We also started leaning more into our social, promoting what we’re doing, letting people know we’re open, posting updates every day as opposed to a few times a week. We had to increase our marketing, because it’s different now.
It reminds me of the very beginning of Tin Pot. Back then I didn’t know anything, about managing people or payroll. I had to learn everything. [Starting a business] is chaotic and it means you don’t sleep that much for a while, but you also learn a lot. So I put on that hat again. This is a new business all over again. We’re selling products we’ve always been selling but through a totally different channel.
Clover: Sadly, many shops are closing their doors. Was that ever a consideration for Tin Pot?
Sunseri: Foot traffic has been the main driver for us. 80% of the purchases are [by] people who walk by and say, “Oh, I want ice cream!” or they’re going to dinner, they spot us, and they say, “Let’s go there afterwards.” So it’s not as much of a planned purchase, and that’s making things really hard right now.
At this point, keeping our doors open is better than not. We looked at the numbers to see how much we’d lose if we closed, and determined if we can make a certain amount, then we can at least keep our doors open. So that’s how we’re operating right now.
The crisis is changing people’s behavior in every way. It’s changing how we can sell, but it’s also changing how people can buy. [Business] is always evolving but now it’s really sped up. There is this intense need to embrace technology and figure out how to sell a product like this, at a time like this.
Clover: Let’s unpack the tech angle.
Sunseri: [laughs] You know, it’s interesting, because I’ve been wanting to redo our website for a long time but don’t have much experience with that type of thing. We had this really old site that’s been around since 2012, and we could sell from it but hadn’t been driving people there. It was never a top priority and we thought it would cost too much [to upgrade]. But then [the crisis] happened and I realized we cannot wait. This is the only way we could grow beyond the delivery model.
So I called up my cousin, who is amazing, and we had it up in 4 days. I learned so much and it was fueled by this mentality of we HAVE to make this work. There’s no way I would have been able to do this without that mentality.
Clover: What platform did you use?
Sunseri: It was either BigCommerce, Shopify, or WooCommerce. We pulled up some old notes comparing [these platforms], and the decision was pretty quick: with BigCommerce, there are no transaction fees if you have multiple payment methods. And it integrates with Clover, which was important if we wanted to ramp up e-commerce on our Clover systems. So BigCommerce it was!
BigCommerce has a plugin for Clover that’s super easy to set up. There were just a couple things I had to do, and all of a sudden the payments showed up on Clover. It’s all tied in, so now all of our system is together, so I can look at all the stores and also the e-com in the same dashboard. That’s huge because it’s really hard to find everything and be able to look at it together. Knowing that e-com is coming through Clover as well, makes it so much simpler.
So now, the new site has been up a little over a week. It’s making it much easier for customers to navigate, and the checkout process is really easy… we shipped out more boxes in the last four days than we had in the past 3 months before the new site! And now we are working on making it as gift-friendly as possible, since the majority of the orders are gifts.
Clover: Some businesses are exploring ways to partner with each other. You mentioned you’re working with a few other merchants?
Sunseri: Yes! We partner with Fleet Street Café in Menlo Park. They’ll start offering Tin Pot on their menu for delivery, since we’ve been working with them to supply them with ice cream. We’re doing promotions for Fleet Street as well on our channels. We’re also reaching out to our suppliers, like Verve Coffee to see if we can do something together, promote each other.
So much is happening so fast, so we’re trying to move as fast as possible.
Clover: The hardest part about a crisis is often not the revenue but taking care of the people.
Sunseri: Yeah. It’s been really hard. The most important thing is keeping people safe. I want to do my part and do everything I can to take care of the people who work for Tin Pot. We’ve been able to maintain our full-time staff: all the store managers, the district manager, our production manager, our finance person, the CEO. I’m very grateful for that. But we don’t have hours for [the other] 80% of our staff. We started a relief fund for them, like a lot of business are doing. We’re trying to help in any way we can and we’re planning on welcoming everybody back with open arms as soon as we can.
Clover: How is the community responding?
Sunseri: I’m finding that people want to help, which is really nice. I definitely feel the support from not just my friends and family but our customers. People want to know if we’re open because a lot of places aren’t. We’re seeing an uptick in our delivery services, that’s been continually going up, so I’m happy to see that.
And people are asking, what can I do how to support Tin Pot, how do I help? That’s been really, really nice.
Honestly, out of all of this, the silver lining is people coming together and wanting to support each other. There’s been this realization, like a curtain pulled back, that… wait a minute, small businesses are people. It’s ironic because we’re all separated in our own homes and we can’t be together. And that’s bringing out this innate need in humans to connect. If we can’t physically connect and see each other face to face, we have to be proactive in figuring out how to do it in other ways—and helping people is one way to connect. I think a lot of people are starting to realize, for example, I can buy a gift card from one of our favorite restaurants.

Clover: What advice would you give other small business owners struggling to maintain their operations?
Sunseri: Talk to people and be honest, make sure you have a place to feel supported, it’s easy to feel alone. Try to find people you can talk to who are going through something similar, because it can be really lonely. Also, throw the rule book completely out the window and just do stuff. If something feels right just try it—you can always pivot later. We don’t have time to do the vetting we normally would.
It’s also important to have your products in more places. We’re in a few specialty grocery stores already, and this week we launched in Whole Foods—45 locations in Northern California.
Clover: And how would you compare the challenges of running a business during non-crisis times versus a global health emergency like this one?
Sunseri: Running a business is hard. In a great economy, it’s a lot harder to talk about how scared you are, how you’re trying something you don’t know, or the things that don’t go well. I learned so much from so many mistakes. I felt I couldn’t share that stuff before, but now, when there is thing that’s affecting everybody, now that we’re all struggling, people are openly talking about struggling: I have to let employees go because I don’t have the hours. How do I support them? How am I gonna pay my bills? How am I going to have enough cash reserves? Everyone is sharing information.
Another thing—and I can only speak for myself—is that I don’t look at businesses that are similar to mine as competitors right now. Instead, I think, we’re in this together, we’re like a family. I’m trying to figure out some way to reach out to them and put my arm around them. Because those are the people who know exactly what I’m going through. I don’t look at business any more as a separate thing from people. It has always felt like people are number one, but it’s true now more than ever.
Clover: What has been the most inspiring moment during this crisis so far?
Sunseri: It all comes back to people wanting to help people. It’s the whole cumulative outreach, everybody wants to help each other—and support [our] health care workers. We want to help too, so we’ve been talking internally… one idea we’re considering is dropping off some ice cream to the medical workers at local hospitals.
Clover has a unique opportunity and ability to help people because right now we need help from services that are about helping small businesses, connecting people, simplifying processes that support small business. That’s now more important than ever. And that means a lot, so thank you.

Here in Part 2, we present a list of the mainstream social media platforms with tips and best practices, and a brief overview of three tools you can use to optimize your social media presence.
 
Strategy comes before content
This might sound like blasphemy, but no, content isn’t king. Marketing strategy really rules the kingdom, and content is its fortress. It’s tempting to just dive right into content creation—and certainly much more fun. All those photo shoots on the beach… Equally mesmerizing are all those likes and followers. But these are just vanity metrics. They don’t guarantee action, sales, or, for that matter, a return on investment of your time or resources.
Marketing strategy requires a much deeper dive than any blog post could possibly offer; entire books—libraries—have been written about it, and about subsets of it (email marketing, content marketing, social media marketing…). Let it suffice to say that your first step, before you dive into the social media pool, is to arm yourself with strategic goals & objectives, and the metrics you’ll use to track those goals and objectives.
In other words, rather than worry about how many people are liking or following your content, we recommend making your business goals very clear. This will help drive your social media marketing strategy. For example, do you want your social media accounts to:

Generate leads
Drive conversion on your website
Improve customer engagement

Next, define your target audience. Who are the people you feel would engage with your business the most? If you’re an established business, you no doubt already have a good sense of your customers. If you’re just starting out, you might need to do a little research—and here’s where social analytics, competitive analysis, and a little social listening can give you gold.
Another area that needs your attention is establishing the metrics that matter to you. Forget likes and yes, even followers. Look at reach—how many unique users are seeing your content? Are they sharing it? Clicks—how many people are interacting with your content, your brand? Hashtags—are people using following or using your hashtags? Which ones? Most critically, how does all this engagement translate for your bottom line?
Having considered all of the above, what kind of stories, narratives, or perspectives are likely to interest your audiences? Perhaps your content is already engaging them, but you want to take it to the next level.
You won’t be able to answer all of these questions straight away; a good marketing strategy is one that evolves over time, and is kept fresh as new data and observations come in. There is much more to a good strategy—so rather than reinvent the wheel, here are links to two organizations that have done the legwork for you:

Hootsuite’s How to Create a Social Media Marketing Strategy in 8 Easy Steps 
Sprout’s How to build your social media marketing strategy for 2020

Now let’s take a look at six of the mainstream social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube.
FACEBOOK
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 2.5 billion
Daily active users (mobile): 1.59 billion
Almost 70% of U.S. adults use Facebook

Facebook is the largest social network on the planet and needs no introduction. Despite all the recent controversy, small businesses can still leverage the power of this platform. A business can have a “page” or a “group”—or both. A page is simply your organization’s or company’s profile, complete with a description, web site, contact info and hours. According to Facebook, two thirds of users it surveyed say they visit the Facebook page of a business at least once a week.
A Facebook group, simply put, is a community. The nice thing about groups is that they notify users of new posts by default; on the other hand, they typically take more effort. Like any other online community, they’ll require your ongoing TLC and non marketing content and interaction. But the potential ROI is significant. Remember the power of relationships we covered in Part 1? A Facebook group can become your virtual village.
Pro tip: Consider using Facebook Live and Facebook Stories. Facebook Live is—you guessed it—a video broadcast live on Facebook. Great format to share your news or announcements in real time. You can even take people on a virtual tour of your restaurant, retail shop, or studio space. Facebook Stories are vertically formatted images or short videos that disappear after 24 hours. They’re seen by half a billion people daily and live at the top of the News Feed, which means they’re not affected by the infamous Facebook algorithm (which can kill your well-intentioned Facebook post). More on Facebook Stories here.
 
INSTAGRAM
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 1 billion+
Daily active users: 500 million
Business accounts: 25 million+

Some social media channels lend themselves more naturally to visuals, and Instagram is certainly one of the most elegant. You might have read articles that wax poetic about Instagram’s soulmate-like connection to the creatives (artists, musicians, actors, and photographers) and their corporate counterparts (fashion and travel brands, restaurants, florists, beauty salons). So if you have a business that doesn’t sell gorgeous product, you should forget about Instagram, right?
Wrong.
Any business can find a way to present itself in a visually appealing way, and use Instagram to its advantage. Just as an image is worth a thousand words, so a story is worth a thousand likes. If you have a story to tell, you can use Instagram. Whether it’s your product, your space, your people, or your customers, you can tell many different kinds of stories. You can post a single image with or without text. A series of images up to 10. A grid of 3, 6, or 9 images that create a visually striking display. Videos (up to 1 minute). You can run an Instagram Story—that tells yours with images.
Pro tip: Make sure you set up—or switch to—a business profile. That makes it easy for your followers to contact you right from your Instagram page. You also gain the ability to run Instagram ads without relying on Facebook, and access Instagram’s analytics, called Insights. You can decide where to drive visitors, and determine the target audience—either a look-alike audience or a new one that you define.
 
LINKEDIN
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 310 million
90 million LinkedIn users are senior-level influencers
Drives over 50% of all social traffic to B2B websites & blogs

LinkedIn is the platform par excellence for professionals and business-to-business (B2B) interaction. As most social media networks, it’s free but also has a paid Premium version that allows you to connect with more people and send messages to people you’re not connected to. It’s a great tool if you’re looking to hire, or be hired. And for B2B marketers, LinkedIn is the absolute heavyweight.
That’s all great, you might be thinking. But should you use LinkedIn if you’re B2C? Say, a restaurant, bookshop, or clothing store. Certainly not the same way or for the same reasons you’d use Facebook or Twitter. Think of LinkedIn as your personal professional network—a great place to connect with other business owners, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders. Think of it as your online village of expertise and knowledge.
Pro tip: If you’re in sales or a small business owner who wants to increase or change their sales funnel, LinkedIn has another paid feature called Sales Navigator. It’s a sales prospecting tool that takes social selling to a new level with the power of LinkedIn’s database. What’s social selling? If you’ve ever posted a picture of your product or a message about your service on social media, you’ve done it. Social selling is leveraging social channels to sell products and services. Here’s more about Sales Navigator from the people who write the “For Dummies” series.
 
PINTEREST
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 335 million
28% of marketers use Pinterest
71% users are female

Pinterest is best for businesses who thrive on visual media. Like YouTube, it’s a visual search engine, but instead of videos it uses “pins.” People who share their visual content are affectionately called “pinners.” Even the company’s stock symbol is “PINS.”
Pinterest is particularly popular with the art, design, and crafting communities, as well as food, furniture, and books. Your business not in any of these areas? Before you write Pinterest off, think about what story your product or service could tell visually. Pins don’t have to be professionally produced magazine-cover photography. You can pin photos of your lattes if you’re a coffee shop. Spa gift sets if you’re a beauty salon. Baskets of bread or pastries if you’re a bakery. You can create infographics that present data, facts, or stats about your industry in an engaging way. Try a series of inspirational quotes against a background, maybe even a wall or window at your store location.
People use Pinterest to shop, get inspired, and share ideas with their friends. So even if one pinner doesn’t click all the way through to your site, she might repin your content and share with her networks. Plus, Pinterest is the fourth most popular social media network in the United States. You heard that right. It ranks ahead of Twitter and LinkedIn, according to Hootsuite (and they should know). It’s also the only social platform that offers visual search—and 62% of millennials and Gen Zers say they want to be able to search by image (see this guide on marketing for Pinterest by Hootsuite).
Pro tip: Just like you can repost in Instagram and retweet in Twitter, you can repin in Pinterest—which helps enhance your boards (collections of pins) without the added effort of creating new content. And did you know about Promoted Pins, available only to businesses? Check out these and many other marketing tips in Buffer’s How to Use Pinterest: Insider Guide for Businesses, informed by Pinterest’s own inhouse team.
 
TWITTER
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 330 million
Daily active users: 152 million
% of users on mobile: 80%

In the words of our own social media expert, Twitter is “the closest social platform to a real-time conversation.” Twitter itself stresses that point—it’s not about the selfie or even the original post, but rather the thread, the exchange, the conversation that the original post galvanizes.
On this platform, visuals are not as critical; text-only tweets are perfectly fine. Twitter is great for news and announcements. For years, the maximum length of a tweet was 140 characters, which the company has now doubled. If that’s still not long enough, you can craft a series of tweets that roll up into a thread—just be sure to annotate each tweet appropriately. If you’ve got a series of five tweets, for example, you’d append “1/5” at the end of the first tweet, “2/5” at the end of the second, and so on.
You can also host Twitter Chats and organize your own collection of Twitter Moments. What are chats and moments? A Twitter chat is an online conversation hosted by a Twitter user (for our purposes, you). You choose a topic for the chat, set the time and date, and create a hashtag that users can use to participate in or simply follow the chat. Twitter Moments are collections of tweets on a theme (access them through the “More” menu just below “Profile.” Twitter has pre-set categories of moments that you can browse through, but you can put together your own and post those on your business profile. For example, you can organize your tweets according to topic: product announcements, events, customer stories, and the like.
And of course, what mature social platform wouldn’t allow its business users to advertise? On Twitter, you can do ads or promoted tweets.
Pro tip: Take advantage of Twitter’s search engine to uncover trending topics, research keywords, or check out how businesses similar to yours are using the platform.
Bonus pro tip: Twitter publishes an annual marketing calendar listing popular events and dates that you can download. The calendar includes tips for tweeting about these events, so don’t miss out on this resource.
 
YOUTUBE
In brief (source)

Monthly active users: 2 billion
Daily active users: 30 million
Average viewing session: 40 minutes

You might think of YouTube as the haven for silly animal vines, fail compilations, and alternate universes of teenage gamers, but that’s just one (ok, three) side of this quietly powerful platform. Not only is YouTube the third largest search engine in the world—not second, as marketing mythology would have it, and here’s more on that if you really want to get into it—nearly half of all marketers are thinking about adding YouTube to their mix, according to Hubspot.
You might also think, well that’s all good but my audience isn’t on YouTube. But consider this: according to HubSpot’s research, people spend a third of their online time watching videos, YouTube reaches more people in the 18-49 age range than any broadcast or cable network, and almost 60% of executives prefer video to text.
But we get it. Creating videos isn’t as easy or fast as typing up a tweet or snapping a photo. If you’re not on YouTube yet, it’s not the end of the world, but if you’ve got stories to tell that might really capture people’s hearts (and eyes and minds) better in video, you might want to consider brushing off that camcorder. The good news is, especially these days, that you don’t need a multi-million dollar production to tell a good story on video. As long as you’re clear on strategy, business goals, and what stories will help you achieve those goals, you can harness video more easily than you think. And yes, of course you can promote your videos.
Here’s more on marketing for YouTube from Neil Patel.
Pro tip: When you upload your videos, make sure to select the right thumbnail (the reduced-size image that represents your video in search results, suggestions, and other lists), and to add your logo to it. Thumbnails are what people see when they’re browsing through videos to watch—and the last thing you want representing you in an ocean of videos is a random frame from yours. And why the logo? Even if people don’t click on your video to watch it, they’ll have seen your brand. The next time they see your video, they might just remember that logo, and click on your video as opposed to someone else’s.
 
Get a little help from the pros
Now that you’ve gotten this far, how does it feel? It’s a lot to take in, especially if you’re just starting out on social, or if you’ve been active on some platforms but want to expand. Or maybe you’ve got all your accounts set up, just no time to produce content, engage, respond to people… whatever your specific situation, there are ways you can streamline social.
This is where applications like Hootsuite, Sprout, and Buffer can help. They’re called social media management tools, and they can turn your social media headaches into an enjoyable part of marketing your business. They enable you to set up and schedule posts on multiple platforms, determine optimal times for posting, and let you see how your posts are performing. Let’s dive right in, shall we?
BUFFER
Basic cost: $15 per month, billed monthly (single user)
Buffer is an easy-to-use social media management tool that helps you manage multiple social media accounts, schedule posts across multiple social accounts, and drill down into analytics. Its calendar view feature gives you a good overview of your posting schedule, and it has intuitive, efficient drag-and-drop publishing capabilities.
Buffer can get expensive as you add user accounts, and its scheduling, reporting, and analytics functions cannot, in the words of one review, “compare to those of Hootsuite.” But if you’re looking for a reasonably priced, clean, easy-to-use centralized interface for social media publishing, Buffer is a great option.
 
HOOTSUITE
Basic cost: $29 per month, billed annually
One of the most recognizable names in the social media management space, Hootsuite is a powerful, highly customizable dashboard that allows multiple users (teams) to monitor social analytics, post, schedule future posts, and even manage social advertising.
On the down side (for some), Hootsuite’s most powerful features are available only in the higher-tier enterprise plans, and more advanced users may find the analytics not deep enough.
Overall however, Hootsuite is one of the most open, comprehensive, and integrated social media management tools on the market. It has a wide range of solutions for SMBs (small to midsize businesses), ranging from curation and posting to collaboration and scheduling. It works with over 250 apps and platforms (such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft business apps, and others). PC Mag calls Hootsuite “the Swiss-knife of social media management solutions.”
For more, check out this comparison of Hootsuite vs Buffer.
 
SPROUT
Basic cost: $99 per user, billed monthly
Moving on to Sprout. Sprout Social is Sprout’s social media management tool, a full-service mix of publishing, scheduling, and analytics. It offers strong CRM (customer relationship management, oriented specifically to social media) and reporting functionality, help desk features, as well as social listening and influencer identification.
As one of the first social media management solutions, Sprout has accumulated a deep well of data points and insights from over 25,000 clients, which in turn helps you as a small business user. The only drawback is that the social listening and keyword monitoring options are fairly limited in the Basic tier, which is already the most expensive of the three tools listed here.
 
Note that these are just three of the tools available to you. PC Mag has done an extensive comparison of social media management tools that you might want to check out.

It is no longer an option not to use social media for business. But that’s old news… most business owners, small, medium, or large, already know the power of social networks, and the downsides of thumbing your organization’s nose at them. The questions today’s businesses are really asking: which platforms should I use, how, and when? And for those who dare ask, why?
A bigger gorilla has just entered the room, however. COVID-19 has upended communities across the country and throughout the world; many small merchants are facing uncertainty, downsizing, and sometimes closure. And yet, many are also rediscovering the heart and soul of their business, and adapting to the new reality with impressive speed. The kind of creative, strategic thinking usually driving startups is now blossoming in (home) offices nationwide, and more than ever it’s pulling on the power of relationships: the connections among business owners, employees, customers and clients, suppliers and vendors, and their larger communities.
Never have we needed the “social” of “social media” more than we do now. 
 
This is a two-part series on social media for small businesses in the age of COVID-19.  Here in Part 1, we look at the role social media is playing during the COVID-19 crisis, what that means for small businesses, and how you, as a merchant, can best approach your social media strategy.
In Part 2, we present a list of the main social media platforms with tips and best practices, and a brief overview of three tools you can use to optimize your social media presence.
 
Social distancing means more connection. Wait, what?
It seems contradictory and perhaps counterintuitive, but the more we are forced to socially distance to protect our physical health, the more we crave human connection to protect our mental and psychological health. Articles are beginning to pile up about that here, here, and here.
It doesn’t help that rates of loneliness have doubled in the U.S. in the past 50 years. Or that a former U.S. surgeon general declared loneliness and emotional well-being to be serious public health concerns.
We humans are deeply social animals. Always have been.
For small businesses, especially those that have historically thrived on person-to-person connections in their communities (read: coffee shops, restaurants, small grocery stores, beauty salons, daycares, auto mechanics), an order to shelter-in-place can sound like a death sentence. But here is where the power of virtual social connections can shine, and prove a life-saver, for merchant, employee, and customer alike.
If you already have a social media presence, fantastic. Your job now is to rev it up about a thousandfold. If you don’t, or your presence is small, or you haven’t seen the lift you were hoping for, there’s no time like the present to dive in—and this time with a little extra insight.
 
Before you post, listen
You might be raring to go and set up an entire week’s worth of posts. But remember what your elders always said… listen before you speak. This is particularly true—and relevant—now. Sensitivities and emotions are high; the isolation we’re feeling during this forced quarantine is driving many people to share more of their thoughts and sentiments than has historically been typical, even for a tech-connected society like ours.
Let’s unpack that.
This means the sharing index, if there’s such a thing (well, there is now that we coined the term…) or the volume of messaging, memes, images, likes, comments, and various other ways people can interact through social media, has gone through the roof.
This also means people are spending way more time on their little screens than probably ever before in the history of Homo sapiens. 
This also means the rate of transmission of misinformation is higher than ever before (that “email from a doctor” about holding your breath to see if you have the virus? Myth.).
So what does all this really mean, for the small business owner?
Put simply, it means it’s a much redder ocean now. (Haven’t heard of the red ocean/blue ocean comparison? Nothing like the red pill/blue pill trope, we promise.) Your critically important COVID-19 related news, new store hours, or pop-up special promos, might just drown in a sea of Instagram challenges (push-ups anyone?). 
But it also means more people than ever before are hungry to make that connection, and if your business doesn’t give it to them, an eggdog video will. We respectfully believe your business has a lot more value than eggdog videos (and that’s why we’re not linking to one in this article).
Bottom line is—and here is the key to it all—that if you know how to listen, if you’re willing to listen, you’ll begin to see what your customers, suppliers, and communities need—and what they want. What makes them anxious and what gives them hope. What they’re missing vs what they lack. One of our own merchants, Becky Sunseri of Tin Pot Creamery, says it best: “Small businesses are people.” 
So spend some time scrolling through the social media posts of your followers as well as those you follow, organizations in your community, news outlets, even your local government agencies. Read the comments. Check out Facebook groups, Instagram stories, LinkedIn posts. Email newsletters. TikToks. Get a sense of the ocean you’re swimming in, so you can feel its every ebb and flow. This is the ocean you’ll need to navigate.  
Understanding the what gives you insight into the why, and you can then translate that into the how.
 
To create or to curate
There’s a golden rule that has cast its benevolent glow on many an entrepreneurial effort. It’s the 80/20 rule, aka the Pareto principle. 
Fun fact: the Pareto principle is named after 19th century Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who made important contributions to the study of income distribution and the analysis of individual choice, and who discovered that in many countries, 80% of the wealth was owned by 20% of the population.
The Pareto principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. In business, they say 80% of sales come from 20% of customers. For social media, experts recommend that 80% of your posts be engaging, creative, inspirational, informational. In other words, not intended to sell. The other 20% is where you can dedicate your content and messaging to drive sales. Because, after all, yours is a business.
Let’s drill down into that a bit.
You might have heard an alternate version of this 80/20 rule for social media: 80% should be third-party content, and 20% yours. This misses the point of engaging your audience. It’s not about where the content comes from, it’s about what story it tells, and how it helps you deepen, enhance, or enrich your relationship to, or connection with, the people and businesses in your social spheres. Whether or not the “80%” content is yours or curated from other sources is not critical. What’s important is that you’re the one sharing it, perhaps even offering your own take on it, and that it’s relevant for and speaks to your audiences.
Think of it this way: 80% of your social posts should enrich your network of relationships, and 20% should support your business. Makes sense doesn’t it? Imagine how you’d feel if your favorite coffee shop spent 80% of their time tweeting and posting about their amazing coffee. Sure, you love their coffee. But do you really want to hear about their coffee that often? After a while you’d stop paying attention to their feed—or worse yet, move on to a competitor’s social channel where they share fun videos of their baristas making their favorite latte art designs. And before you know it, you’re in the OTHER coffee shop every morning. Er, picking up curbside of course.
Then there’s the indisputable factor of how our brains work. Yes, at a fundamental level, we crave the familiar. It makes us feel safe and comfortable. But when we see or read something new, our neurons perk up and say, hey, pay attention, we haven’t seen this before. 
All that to say… see why it’s a good idea to put your promotional posts in that 20% bucket?
As we said above, humans are social animals. Our actions are driven by decisions that are in turn motivated by our sentiments. And those sentiments—how we feel about a person or event, or a product, service, or brand—are shaped by our relationships and experiences.
Oh, one more thing. As you work on your own content, don’t worry too much about how professional it looks. Beautiful product images are great, but when it comes to the grittier stuff—the stories of your workers, the challenges you’re facing, or what you’re doing to stand up a new e-commerce website—it’s perfectly fine, and in fact often better, to simply be real. People are increasingly wary of over-produced content, especially video. Many are living a reality that is much harder and more raw than it was just a few months ago, and the media content that denies that reality can easily fall flat—or feel inauthentic or disingenuous. Not to mention that video or images that clearly suggest a large production budget was spent, might call into question how else those funds might have been (better) spent within the community.

He shares the innovative ways in which Onyx is adapting to the COVID-19 crisis, supporting its employees, its customers, and the hundreds of cafes that use Onyx beans. …",28-04-2020,https://blog.clover.com/meet-the-merchant/meet-the-merchant-onyx-coffee-lab/,"Earlier this year, we launched a new series called Meet the Merchant, Q&As with real-world Clover merchants. In our first two installments, we talked to Ludwig’s German Table and Tin Pot Creamery.
Join us as we chat with Jon Allen, the co-founder of Onyx Coffee Lab. He shares the innovative ways in which Onyx is adapting to the COVID-19 crisis, supporting its employees, its customers, and the hundreds of cafes that use Onyx beans.
This installment of the Meet the Merchant series is a COVID-19 Small Business special edition.
Clover: Onyx Coffee Lab seems to be more than just your average cafe. Can you tell us a bit about your business model?
Jon Allen: Sure! Onyx as a whole is different because our main business is roasting for other cafes. I didn’t feel that there was a roaster in our demographic (high-end specialty cafes) that was aimed at the coffee industry itself. We wanted to market to baristas and owners, but it turns out the public really likes our beans too. In addition to supplying between 500-600 cafes with our beans, we run three stand-alone coffee shops, and recently opened up a fourth inside The Momentary—a contemporary art museum/performance venue.
We are running a fun experiment in the new cafe venue. Guests have the choice between two different menus: some items are made by automated machines, and others are made by hand by baristas. We hope, over time, to collect data on what people prefer, publish the results, and use them to drive our own practices and inform other cafes as well. Another fun feature at the new venue is that we’ve made oatmilk the standard for all of our drinks. Traditional dairy is available with a small carbon tax of $0.50. We are trying to change the assumption that dairy milk is the default.
Clover: You mentioned your business has changed as a result of the COVID-19 safety measures. How are you weathering the disruption?
Allen: The four cafes are the face of our company. When this struck, we pivoted immediately to takeaway to get people out of the lobby, since our baristas weren’t feeling comfortable.
We have Clover Stations tethered to Minis. We were able to separate the displays and set up walk-up windows in each location. It took us about 3 days to make that transition, and we are still running those currently. It’s allowed us to retain about 40-50% of our original business, which we feel is a great number for what’s happening in this economy.
Clover: It’s great that you prioritized the safety of your staff and your customers.
Allen: Yes, safety was a big deal for us and for our staff. We are running curbside pickup as well. The second major operation was to get our ordering system online using MunchEm. We integrated that into our website for curbside pickup and made a system for safe delivery. Customers pull into labeled parking spots (A, B, C, D) and they text us when they are here. We deliver to their car without them having to get out.
Clover: What other factors are at play for you as a manager? How are you caring for your team during this crisis?
Allen: My wife and I are the founders of Onyx. Most of our company has been with us a really long time; they are more than staff. We want to find a way to keep people in their jobs and keep the doors open, but we don’t want to force people to come to work if they don’t feel safe. It has been a hard tightrope to walk, but we’ve been working on solutions as we go.
We check in with every staffer regularly to see what they need, what feels right, get feedback, and identify who is feeling nervous and might need to take some time off. It helps us stay on top of any issues or concerns, and identify where any dangerous points of contact with others are happening. It’s a daily dialogue to understand who really needs the work. That’s been an important thing. It’s strange as an employer, but we have been asking people to let us know about their financial situation, and if they feel comfortable giving up a few shifts to help someone else. We want to be sensitive to everyone’s needs, which means asking more questions than we normally would.
Clover: How have your customers responded?
Allen: People will do anything for coffee. It can be the apocalypse and we will have a line out the door. Truthfully, the walk-up window is kinda fun. We’ve talked about having something like that even when things go back to normal.
Clover: What about your larger community?
Allen: We know that not every cafe has been able to adapt the way we have. To help others out, we started a campaign called Rising Tides. We are using our existing e-commerce platform and giving each cafe an individual code to promote online purchase of coffee products. When their customers shop in our online store using their cafe’s code, the cafe gets 15% of the entire sale. That’s been going extremely well. We have 60 cafes across the country participating in Rising Tides right now. It helps us support the cafes we supply and the customers who want quality coffee at home!
Clover: Was e-commerce a big part of the formula before this crisis?
Allen: We realized we didn’t stress e-commerce enough before [the crisis]. Thank goodness we are doing it now because it’s keeping us afloat. Now we’re realizing how much it can help us even beyond this crisis if we put more effort into it.
Clover: Anything else you would change?
Allen: We are using this time as a big business edit. It’s nice to examine change when there’s such a community of vulnerable empathy and grace. We are closing at 6pm now instead of 9pm. That might stay even after restrictions are lifted. It allows us to clean and do better work, and 6-9pm aren’t traditionally profitable hours. So, we can use this period as a catalyst for making changes that are better for the business, like cutting menu items that we don’t believe in or aren’t economical.
Clover: Anything else you’d like to share?
Allen: Clover has been key in helping us navigate unknown territory. We traditionally haven’t done call-in orders, and really encouraged our customers to consume our coffees in-house as it creates the best possible experience. Having to launch take away and mobile ordering was really intimidating. Clover connected us with programs and people to help us understand how to adjust. They’ve been really responsive to our questions and requests for changes as we figure out what works and what doesn’t. It has helped us continue to support our community and staff in a very difficult time by still serving customers in the best and safest way we know how.

One investment firm estimated that total foot traffic to US retailers was down 97.6% for the week through March 27 as compared to 2019. The lockdowns are expected to continue over the next 6 to 12 months; as a result, many merchants are focusing on their online stores to continue serving customers stuck at home. If you’re new to e-commerce, we suggest starting with this post on how to take your business online quickly.
It’s one thing to create an e-commerce site. Creating a dynamic, elegant, and inviting online presence is quite another. Once you’re up and selling online, how can you make that the best and most profitable experience possible? This brief guide offers tips and advice to help you adapt your business model and put e-commerce front-and-center.
Logistics and delivery
If you’re new to e-commerce, you may be learning the ins and outs of order fulfillment on the fly. Not only will you face the challenge of establishing a delivery operation, you’ll be doing so in extenuating circumstances: customers now expect to see policies and processes in place that prevent the spread of coronavirus through safe shipping and handling. Here are some things to think about as you set up your ordering and delivery operation.
Use safe packing practices. The WHO and CDC have not found any cases of transmission via packages. That being said, customers appreciate any extra effort you can take to be extra cautious. If you or your employees are packing products for shipment, wear face masks and gloves. It’s also helpful to post publicly on your website and social media accounts the steps you’re taking to make each shipment as safe as possible.
Update your returns policy. Lockdowns are preventing customers from visiting and handling your product in-person before they buy from you. “This shift will mean more returns, due to the limitations of shopping online and the way people shop, which often involves ‘bracketing,’ or buy to try, buying multiples of size, color … with the intention of keeping their favorite and returning the rest,” Happy Returns CEO David Sobie told CNBC.
You may want to update your returns policy to account for an increased number of returns. Increased returns can drive up your costs, waste packaging, and increase the health risk to delivery drivers and your employees. On the other hand, customers will remember generous policies during difficult times, which may translate into greater loyalty. Some retailers are lengthening their return window to allow shoppers more time to get to the post office or to visit the store once you are able to re-open. Try to find a balance between being generous to homebound customers while factoring in your ROI and labor costs.
Set up order fulfillment and labor. It may make sense to partner with a fulfillment center to help manage your shipping and delivery. Fulfillment centers bring expertise, larger space for storing inventory, and quicker delivery times. Whiplash, Fulfillify, and ShipBob are all e-commerce fulfillment centers worth exploring.
Understandably, fulfillment partners are usually more expensive than shipping and packing products yourself. If your volume of e-commerce orders is manageable, you might do just fine with having your staff fulfill them. Or, take inspiration from New York City—where the local government offered delivery jobs to out-of-work freelancers—and see if there’s an opportunity to support other businesses in your community.
One note on fulfillment: because nothing is easy in a pandemic, there are particular challenges to doing fulfillment safely. Distancing requirements, logistics of delivering packing supplies to your team members, and inventory management are all a little more complicated during this time. The Clover App Market contains a wealth of apps you may find helpful in keeping your logistics organized. Try apps like Better Delivery, Drop Ship Manager, and Address Labels to get started.
Calculate your shipping costs. You will also need to factor in costs for packaging and delivery and decide which delivery carrier to use. Some carriers are offering free packaging during this time. Many are also offering scheduled pickups from your location. You can review the policies of the main carriers here:

USPS
UPS
DHL Express
Fedex

You can always get a printer and labels that will work for your packaging and shipping process. If you want to streamline that process, however, there are a few tools that can help you. Check out ShipStation as an option to automate the shipping cost calculation and label printing process. Aftership is another popular free tracking solution worth looking into.
Make sure to communicate with your customers as your delivery operation evolves. Manage expectations around shipping delays and arrival times. Consider encouraging customers to purchase more than your average ticket value by offering free shipping for orders above that threshold.
Marketing your online store
As lockdowns continue, you may need to broaden your focus from meeting the needs of your existing customers to include growing new e-commerce sales. If you’re just starting to market your e-commerce site, experts recommend spending time on two things: identifying your audience and positioning your product.
“The more you know about your audience, the easier it becomes for you to create compelling marketing materials,” says The Blueprint, a publication by The Motley Fool. “This is why creating a buyer persona is an important step before you even start marketing your products. With it, you have a solid grasp of who your audiences are and what makes them tick.” Once you have identified a buyer persona, you can learn more about how to best position your product online. How can you talk about your product on social media, on your website, and in online ads in a way that appeals to your target customer?
If there’s a silver lining in this lockdown, it’s that there’s a newly captive audience on the internet. People are shopping from home for many more items than ever before. There’s an opportunity to grow sales through your e-commerce site—and here are some ways to get started.
Make it easy to find your e-commerce shop. If you’re adding e-commerce to your existing website, as Tin Pot did, have you made your new channel prominent and easy to find from your homepage? Are you linking to it from your social media channels, in your email newsletter, and on sites like Yelp, Google Business, and Pointy? Signal from as many places as possible that you’re still open for online business.
Optimize your site for higher traffic. If your site feels clunky and hard to navigate, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to maintain sales during this time. It’s important to make sure that customers can find your site, and also that it’s organized and easy to navigate. Search engine optimization can certainly get complicated, but there are simple changes you can make to help your store appear in more relevant online searches. Check out our quick and dirty SEO guide for more details. As for site navigation, think carefully about the user experience, organize your stock listings in an intuitive way, and consult with your friends, families, staff, and customers for more perspectives on how to streamline your e-commerce site.
Include high-quality images. As you work to optimize your site, we recommend that you use excellent product images. Professional photography across your site can make a huge difference in the shopper experience. For a little inspiration, check out Tin Pot Creamery’s beautiful online store. The images shown on your site should not only be enticing, but they should be consistent with your overall store design. If your shop is stark and industrial, use dramatic lighting; If your aesthetic is more approachable, make sure the lighting is warm and inviting.
Get creative with your content. With less or non-existent foot traffic, how can you keep your employees busy? Some retailers have started offering curated subscription boxes with customer favorites and complementary products that they’re hoping will become more popular. Create a video preview of what’s going into each subscription box on your social pages, and have your team get creative with your content. Skincare brand Glossier, for example, launched Glossier Live Edit, a video chat program where Glossier team members hosted 1:1 chats with customers about skincare, beauty routines, and products.
Customer loyalty and sustaining your business
Your e-commerce site is now your primary tool for selling to existing customers. And, since existing customers are the core of any business, how can you make sure they’re still being served by your e-commerce site?
Encourage repeat purchases with subscriptions. If your customer is likely to buy your product on a repeat basis, make automatic reorders easy. Give a small discount for subscribing to regular refills, and ideally let the customer set their preferred refill cadence.
Lower shopping cart abandonment (the “almost sale”). The average global rate of cart abandonment—when customers add items to their online cart but never click purchase—is just over 75%. That’s a huge missed opportunity for many retailers.
Some simple changes to the shopping and checkout process can help you lower cart abandonment rates. Create urgency by showing stock availability: when an item is running low, a casual browser may become a buyer much faster. Set up an automatic email that is triggered when a customer leaves something in their cart—Mailchimp provides an easy way to do this. One report found that of the 45% of “cart abandoned” emails that are opened, 50% of them receive click-throughs, and 50% of those click-throughs result in completed purchases.
Other tactics for smarter e-commerce
There are many ways to encourage customers to shop at your e-commerce site. Some retailers offer a free gift with purchases over a certain amount. Whether or not you’re able to give discounts during this time is unique to each retailer; we know times are tough, and so do customers.
Another great way to build customer loyalty is to motivate customer account creation with a loyalty program that encourages repeat buying. Give a small discount off a customer’s first order if they create an account. Alternately, you could offer a first-time-buyer discount code in a pop-up that invites new visitors to sign up for your email list. Everyone wins: you get a customer’s email (and hopefully, a first purchase) while the customer gets a discount.

One analyst estimates that coronavirus could lead to 15,000 permanent retail store closures in 2020. Most customers are simply not shopping due to concerns over health and safety as well as the economy.
We know how hard it is for retailers trying to stay in business. Many smaller merchants are learning the ropes of e-commerce for the first time. We’re here to help: this guide will take you through both short- and long-term steps to build your e-commerce site, stay in touch with consumers, and manage your expenses.
Take time to strategize
In this crisis, the news changes minute to minute. It’s tempting to constantly refresh your Twitter feed or watch for Google Alerts, but try to resist letting time-consuming distractions fill up your precious time. Analysts predict that it will take the US economy between one and ten years to recover completely, and at least three months for businesses to start opening to customers again, depending on which state you’re in.
What’s needed to get through this is to shift your mindset. People need to change the way they think on a dime when faced with a sudden conflict or survival situation. In this crisis, however, we have time to adjust and adapt. Make sure you take the time to think about your long-term plan. Many of us feel the urge to respond to the crisis quickly, but thinking more strategically about survival over the next six months can serve you better in the long run.
Rethink your inventory
In the short term, customers are prioritizing the essentials: toilet paper has suddenly gone virally important, as have bottled water, pantry staples like rice, flour, and legumes, and cleaning supplies. Identify what products from your supply are considered essential, and make it easy for customers to get them. Communicate proactively when you run out of stock on a particular item. And when that happens, set up an email list to let a customer know when something is back in store or on its way. Alternately, you can upsell a similar product that’s still available: for instance, salon-caliber haircare supplies instead of a cheaper brand.
In addition, you may need to adjust your inventory ordering schedule. Plan to reevaluate your demand forecast based on these four factors identified by Retail Touchpoints:

Timing: as a global pandemic, COVID-19 is impacting shipping and warehouse operations around the world. You may face some delays in your supply chain.
Magnitude: this is a measure of worst-case and best-case scenarios. Can you add some flexibility into your ordering schedule for an unexpectedly early or late lift of the lockdown period?
Channels: how will the way you sell your product—e.g., through e-commerce rather than at a brick-and-mortar location—impact demand and delivery?
Product mix: What goods do you predict will become more valuable as lockdowns continue? What will consumers rush to order when the lockdowns are lifted? For the products that are deemed “essential,” what do you expect the reorder frequency to be?

It might be helpful to use data from your website traffic, historic sales, and market trend reports to inform your schedule for restocking your inventory. Try a site like Mintel or Nielsen for research-based market analysis.
Double-down on e-commerce
Most shopping is taking place virtually for the near future. As one analyst put it, “There’s no reason to be opening stores that people can’t go to.” Of course, different states are enacting and relaxing safety measures at different times and in different ways. Take time to do the math to see when it’s more profitable to save on overhead expenses and keep your store closed as restrictions begin to ease.
Many retailers already have an e-commerce presence, but now is a good time to take your landing page beyond a basic storefront. What can you add to your site that contributes to the overall customer experience? Consider how you can replicate your in-store experience virtually.
Try adding elements such as:

A way to review a product within your page: for instance, customers who purchased a sweater can provide feedback that it fits “true to size” or “runs large” to help customers find the right fit and cut down on returned items.
A widget that suggests other “products you may like” based on a customer’s browsing history.
A tick box for automatic refills at checkout to encourage regular repeat purchases.
An option customers can select for curbside pickup, if allowed in your area.

We also recommend building out an FAQ page with customer support contact information. Include things like your store availability (are you online only or still open at your brick-and-mortar location?), safety and health measures, and shipping & return policies. Make it easy for customers to get in touch with you via email or through your website.
Find ways to engage your customers
Marketing during a global disaster is tricky. “Marketing is all about enticing us to buy things, and right now that’s inappropriate. First of all, we’re not in the mood for it; second, it’s hard because everything’s closed; and third, it’s not the time because it’s a hard time,” said Neil Saunders, GlobalData Retail Managing Director, told RetailDive.
Instead of selling, focus on engaging. Get creative with your content to keep customers quarantined at home entertained. Launch a blog or video series on Instagram Live, Facebook Live, or YouTube. Post educational but fun videos that feature your products: salons can show customers how to do a smokey eye at home, hardware stores can provide tutorials on how to fix a leaky toilet, while garden centers can share tips for starting an at-home vegetable garden.
Another option is to host giveaways on your social media pages to drive sharing and raise brand awareness. Glossier, for instance, decided to proceed with the launch of their new hand cream by giving it to 10,000 healthcare workers first. Tools such as Gleam or Woobox allow you to embed giveaways on a landing page or blog post.
Along with adjusting your marketing strategy, look for ways to make your products feel fresh and exciting. Here are some ideas to get you inspired:

Offer subscriptions of curated boxes. Many consumers are holed up at home and craving some curated fun and inspiration. What items can you package and offer to customers on a subscription basis to bring your store into their living room? Can you partner with other small businesses to curate boxes of complementary ingredients? Subscription boxes are a great way to help customers discover new products. Look to brands like Birchbox, KiwiCo, and Rent the Runway for inspiration. Learn how to get started building a subscription box with this guide.
Sell gift cards. A study by First Data* found that 72% of gift card shoppers spend more than the value of the gift card when they redeem their purchase. Run a marketing campaign that encourages friends and family to send gift cards to each other as a way to connect from afar. Gift cards can then be redeemed at your online store or in person when stores re-open. Here’s how to get started with gift cards from Clover.
Offer bulk sales or donate slow-moving inventory/deadstock to hospitals, teachers, care centers, and other places that need extra assistance during this time. You may be able to write off a large donation on your taxes.

Communication is key
Customers are wary of any shopping activities that might be causing unnecessary exposure to COVID-19. To manage risk, explore some of these ways to keep your sales safe and sanitary. Put your customers’ minds at ease with special sanitation stations at store entrances and employees who hand out wipes and clean carts and baskets for customers.
Contactless payment is another easy way to lower the risk of spreading the virus while shopping. All of Clover’s POS devices, including Flex, our mobile POS, have contactless payment built in. Contactless payments offer a fast, secure, and hygienic way for your customers to pay with a debit card, credit card, or mobile device. Simply tap and go—a great option for curbside pickup.
Beyond letting customers know the logistics of your approach, give them a way to stay connected. Providing good customer service is still a critical business priority during a pandemic. Small businesses are the backbone of our communities, so let people know how they can support you, ways you’re giving back, and when you need a little extra help.
Payment systems
More than likely, your business is already accepting credit and debit cards for customer orders, and possibly even contactless payments. But what about your payroll, hourly contractors, and vendors? If you’re still using paper checks to pay your people, consider this:

Paper checks use up natural resources (i.e., trees)
Paper checks run the risk of loss, delay, or identity theft
The time & labor of sending paper checks cost you over $7 per check (according to the Aberdeen Group)
The jury’s still out on the risk of the virus surviving on paper surfaces. Better play it safe.

Just as you appreciate receiving prompt payment for an order, so too do your people and your suppliers. Consider going completely paperless for payroll and all your accounts payable. Options include Gusto for payroll, Payable for contractors, and for electronic payments, check out Bill.com, Zelle, and ACH transfers or direct deposits through your bank.
Get some relief
Everyone needs a boost right now. As you cut costs and seek out new avenues to support your sales, get some assistance from federal and private funding resources available for retailers. Here are some places to start:

Visit Clover’s own financial resources page, updated regularly.
Hello Alice is partnering with Verizon to offer emergency grants of up to $10,000.

This is even more true during the coronavirus pandemic. The cash-flow gap is real, and many owners haven’t found success in accessing government loans and grants to stay afloat.
We at Clover want to help support our merchants in every way we can, so we’ve waived the fees associated with Clover Rapid Deposit through the end of May. Read on to learn more about Clover Rapid Deposit and see if it might help you navigate these difficult waters.
Clover Rapid Deposit lets you access your money faster
Clover Rapid Deposit is a service that provides faster access to the funds generated by your sales transactions. Usually it takes days for those funds to appear in your bank account, but with Rapid Deposit, you can access your money in minutes.
We’d like to emphasize that Rapid Deposit is not a loan. There is nothing to pay back or worry about. It’s your money, and Rapid Deposit simply lets you use it faster.
Clover Rapid Deposit is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so you can access your money on weekends and even holidays. You can’t always control when your bills come due or when you need to buy more supplies.
How does it work?
You can access Clover Rapid Deposit on any of your Clover devices or through your Dashboard. Setup is a breeze. When you first launch Rapid Deposit, you’ll be asked to link a Visa or Mastercard business debit card to your Clover account.
Once your card is linked to your Clover account, you’ll be able to see how much of your funds are available for Rapid Deposit. Then, you can choose the amount you’d like to access immediately. For your security, the system will send you a one-time confirmation code. Once the security check is complete, your funds will be ready for you in your linked account!
We’re also introducing a new feature—scheduling. Now you can set up a Rapid Deposit schedule on the date and time that works for you. You can even set up recurring deposits if you like, which helps you bridge the gap in these difficult times. Consider maximizing your funds by scheduling your Clover Rapid Deposit daily, just prior to your close of business.
There are a few limitations to this service. If you’re using Clover Capital, you won’t be eligible for Rapid Deposit until your loan is repaid. Pass-through transactions (like American Express or Discover) aren’t eligible either.
No fees in May*
Now is the perfect time to try Clover Rapid Deposit. Usually, Rapid Deposit transactions carry a 1% fee. For example, if you transferred $1,000, you’d get $990.
For the month of May, however, we are waiving this fee for all merchants. If you transfer $1,000, you get $1,000. It’s as simple as that.
We recognize that waiving this fee doesn’t solve all of your problems right now. Your challenges are real, and we want to support you as best as we can. So every little step we can take to help you, we are more than happy to do so. We encourage you to take advantage of this offer, since there’s no risk to you or your business.
For more information on how to navigate the COVID-19 crisis, check out these web pages on financial relief, business preparedness, and our general merchant resources.
 
 
* The Clover Rapid Deposit fee waiver is valid through May 31, 2020. No fees will be charged and no references to Clover Rapid Deposit will appear on your statement for any Clover Rapid Deposit usage or activity through May 31, 2020. Normal processing fees continue to apply subject to other applicable waivers. Clover Rapid Deposit fees will resume on June 1, 2020.

news_588,news,Meet the Merchant: Magnolia Emporium,"Join us as we chat with Randolph James, the owner of Magnolia Emporium in Charlotte, North Carolina. He shares how Magnolia built its business, supports its community, and is weathering the storm of the COVID-19 shutdown. …",14-05-2020,https://blog.clover.com/meet-the-merchant/meet-the-merchant-magnolia-emporium/,"Our Meet the Merchant series features Q&As with real-world Clover merchants. In our first three articles, we talked to Ludwig’s German Table, Tin Pot Creamery, and Onyx Coffee Lab.
In this installment, we chat with Randolph James, the owner of Magnolia Emporium in Charlotte, North Carolina. He shares how Magnolia built its business, supports its community, and is weathering the storm of the COVID-19 shutdown.
Clover: How did Magnolia Emporium come to life?
Randolph James: Magnolia Emporium was created from a bit of a dream—probably more passion than anything. In 2008, I was taking a break from modeling in the Philippines and was at a family haunt called San Miguel de Allende [in Mexico]. I was at a frustrating point in my career, and I picked up the phone and called my mom, Thelma, to ask for some advice. I needed to get back to work, but the market had tanked. She said “Well, what’s your passion?” I answered that design has always been my passion. She said, “That’s your answer.”
I’ve built and sold a lot of businesses over the years, but the common theme has always been high-end design. I needed a name and I needed a brand. I needed something that would work in Mexico, the United States, and in the Philippines. I brainstormed extensively with my mother and my godmother Louise as we developed a vision for the brand and its logo. The common thread was that they all have magnolia trees, so that’s how we came up with the name. Because what we were building was more of an emporium—a collection of curated odds and ends—we called it Magnolia Emporium. Louise has been a fashion model for over 60 years, and our collective aesthetic led us to what is now our iconic logo design.

Clover: And how did your portfolio of products evolve?
James: I wanted to curate products that would bring people in. I was planning it to be by appointment, but I wanted to see if I could bring in foot traffic. A bar was going to open up behind us so I added cocktail mixers. There were a lot of people walking their dogs in the neighborhood, and I had designed a pet boutique in South Florida. So, I thought to add pet toys as well.
I continued drawing from all the businesses in my past, and wanted to be broad in my offerings. Instead of building just one idea out, I spent a few thousand dollars filling shelves and containers with various types of products to see what moved. It would save me from shelling out too much up front and minimize my risk as I found my clientele. But to my surprise, everything worked! I couldn’t believe it. So we have a really eclectic mix of art, home goods, and pet accessories. Part of what we do is help support those who come into our lives, whether it’s the small business owners we buy from or the artists who come into our store who want to show with us. We have 45 artists that we help support.
Clover: That’s great that you were thinking about your community as you planned your inventory. What can you tell us about the neighborhood surrounding Magnolia Emporium?
James: Well, we looked around for some offices. After about a year scouring Charlotte, North Carolina, I settled on the place we are located right now. It was very industrial. I was feeling the potential in the neighborhood. I was introduced to some wonderfully influential people for the community and within the city: Caren Wingate [Chairwoman of the Gold District and real estate broker] and Steven Overcash [architect]. They were very passionate about this community, which is called the Gold District. They showed immediate enthusiasm for my business plan, and helped me become more involved in the community.
I had a community mural put up on the side of our building which has become synonymous with the Gold District. It is one of the most photographed murals in Charlotte now. We allowed local businesses to add logos for a nominal fee, and that fee goes directly to the artist. It allows me to give the artist a continual stipend from the work she created for me, even now. I think we have five more logos that are getting ready to be added. For me, it is just all about community. Without it you don’t have the support of the people who live there and work there. They are our customers, and we are also customers of theirs, going to the bars and restaurants. We want to support them as much as they support us.
Clover: How did you end up deciding to go with Clover as your point of sale?
James: I’m very big on research. I went through every merchant services provider in great detail. Consistently everything that I found pointed me back to Clover. And frankly, the aesthetics of the system were appealing to me, too. I’m very big on overall design. I didn’t want a place that was an obvious register in my shop. So Clover really fit the design aesthetic that we needed. It also allowed for a large amount of inventory. Robert Naylor, Magnolia’s co-owner and CFO, says “no” to financial decisions that may adversely affect our bottom line. But with Clover, he said “absolutely yes!” Only once in our time with you have we run into an issue, and it was just something technical. We had a need for replacement and it was barely 24 hours and a new system was there. I knew from that point on that I made the right decision with Clover. Whenever we call with questions, Clover’s there.
As we progressed, our notoriety increased. We started getting more businesses in the area. So I joined the board of the Gold District, going to city council meetings and helping develop the plans. One of the things I recommended as new businesses were opening up in the district was Clover. And now about 70 or 80 percent of our [business] community uses Clover.

Clover: We know that the COVID-19 crisis is impacting nearly every business out there. How are you faring?
James: Our store has been shut down for two and a half months already. I noticed a downturn immediately after Christmas, actually. We started closing some days beginning in January and February as a health precaution. My CFO is diabetic and I have had a compromised immune system since I was a child, so it’s a dangerous situation for me and my team.
[Right now] we’re focusing on keeping a presence in the community and maintaining our social media, trying to keep our face out there. We’re trying to support other businesses by sharing their information through our channels—businesses that are offering drive-by pickup for food and take-out cocktails, for example.
Businesses around us are starting to open up on a very limited basis. But, it’s not quite safe enough for me to be at the store yet. So we have to, for my own health and safety, continue to maintain closure at the store. We don’t have a choice. It’s not worth it to risk health and safety.
Clover: We’re really sorry to hear that, but we know your loyal customer base will support you when you’re able to reopen. Do you have advice for other businesses as they navigate this crisis?
James: Just hold on. Do whatever you can. Make calls—to the mortgage company, to the auto company, to the insurance company—and get abatements. Get the delays that you need. Do what you can to try and stay in business because you’ve put your blood, sweat, and tears into it, as most small business owners do.
You also need to reinvent. If you can offer drive-by pickup, do it. The most exquisite, Michelin-starred restaurant nearby usually offers creations that blow your mind. But now they are making roasted chicken and mashed potatoes and things like that for pickup, because it helps keep their employees paid and their “doors open” on a limited basis. If you can set up a tent and sell outside, do it. If you need to do a fundraising campaign, do it. If you need to go after grants, do it. One bad season can shut a business down. Do whatever you have to do to keep that dream alive.
However, it is okay if it fails. If you still have your health, that’s all that matters. That’s more important than anything else. You can always start anew if you have to.

This guide focuses on ideas for beauty and health providers, legal and accounting firms, and maintenance and mechanical services to manage the global pandemic.  
…",20-05-2020,https://blog.clover.com/crisis-support/covid-19-service-businesses-survival-guide/,"Like many other sectors, small businesses in the service industry have been hit hard by the outbreak of COVID-19. According to one report, one million service workers in the beauty industry are being impacted by the coronavirus. That doesn’t even begin to account for the personal trainers, maintenance workers, and dozens of other professions that are seeing customer interactions dry up.
When your business model depends on some level of human contact, you may be at a loss for how to shift your focus to stay afloat. This guide focuses on ideas for beauty and health providers, legal and accounting firms, and maintenance and mechanical services to manage the global pandemic.
Shift your mindset
To many of us, the world feels like a scary place right now. Everyone navigates this differently, but some are able to shift their mindset and approach this pandemic as a challenge rather than a source of stress. To be sure, changing the way you approach this crisis can be a different experience than taking on a growth mindset for the sake of personal improvement when your survival isn’t at stake. Shifting to a “can-do” attitude and tapping into internal determination is the first step to building your business back up again.
For service industries in particular, human contact is assumed as the baseline of business. Health and beauty professionals, for instance, thrive on in-person appointments, make-up consultations, group yoga classes, and in-person therapy sessions. Lawyers and accountants need to consult with clients in private, and attorneys may need to make court appearances. And other service professionals are in and out of homes making repairs, consulting on renovations, dropping off materials, or providing landscaping maintenance.
But there are multiple ways to establish contact. Identifying the most strategic ways to do so while preserving distance is key. As you start rethinking your service model, look to other sectors experiencing the similar challenges: schools, musicians, artists, and restaurants are all asking these very same questions. Creativity is the name of the game here. What can your business still offer that honors social distancing and keeps your customers safe?
Rethinking health and beauty services
Salons, spas, gyms, yoga studios, and other health & fitness service providers are struggling right now; many have had to completely shutter in light of shelter-in-place orders. Much of what they can offer now depends on each state’s particular regulations. As much as possible, these businesses should consider going digital. Here are some ideas to get started:

Offer one-on-one virtual consultations. If your business thrives on personal connection, set up appointments for 1:1 video consultations with your stylists, personal trainers, or therapists. One makeup brand, for instance, provided 15-minute virtual consultations with stylists to address customers’ specific beauty needs.
Post your classes online. Live-streamed or pre-recorded video isn’t just for workout studios. Offer a workshop on at-home grooming and self-care, like “how to touch up your roots,” or “how to shape your brows at home,” for example. This is a great opportunity to provide a makeup workshop or guided workout—and you can make additional income by selling products a customer might need for the workshop.
Focus on community. One gym decided that to keep its trainers and coaches employed, it would continue to offer online fitness classes to existing members while donating a portion of membership revenue to local charities. The community rallied around the gym; no memberships were canceled and workouts continued online.
Sell your products. Customers are craving comfort right now. If you have enough stock of familiar products—massage oil, shampoo, or essential oils—offer to deliver or provide curbside pickup for customers who want to bring your good vibes home.
Develop a cleaning protocol. If your studio is able to open—or if you’re anticipating re-opening soon—start working on a cleaning and hygiene protocol to keep your customers safe. Communicate this procedure to your clientele as soon as possible. Start by adopting and training your team on the CDC’s guide to cleaning and disinfecting.

Remember that in addition to protecting your clientele, you need to keep your employees safe as well. Prioritize online activity and communicate regularly what you’re doing to sanitize your environment. This will help your team make educated decisions about when they feel safe enough to return to work, if they haven’t already.
Rethinking legal and accounting services
Whereas some banks and other highly regulated institutions still require in-person appointments for certain services, legal and accounting businesses can be more flexible. Legal counsel and accounting services remain critical regardless of social distancing. Luckily, it’s relatively easy to transition your client consultations to audio or video calls.
Nevertheless, the COVID-19 crisis may create new hurdles for lawyers and accountants. Many individual professionals and firms might experience significant changes in their income during this period. These changes affect how your clients’ taxes must be filed and paid, or when they might launch a new venture requiring legal assistance, but they also may affect the budget they have dedicated to paying your fees. Here are some ways to be proactive with your business during COVID-19.

Be the go-to expert. Businesses and individuals will turn to you for guidance now more than ever. Communicate pertinent information that can impact your community and position your business as leaders in your field. Remind clients of any revised tax filing or payment deadlines. Stay on top of stimulus options for individuals, families, and businesses to best advise clients. Attorneys who work with financial services should anticipate helping clients access their emergency funds to offset losses during shutdown.
Stay flexible. Help your clients find relief by reviewing current engagement letters to identify necessary changes in scope, timelines, and fees—this is a service you can offer other small businesses that may be unable to pay their vendors on time, but also something you need to be aware of for your own benefit.
Invest in security. Be careful about which video conferencing tool you use. Your electronic communications with clients might include sensitive information, so carefully consider the internet security measures at your home offices, the safeguards your clients have in their home offices, and the security of any communication or conferencing software you use. Make password protected systems a priority for everyone’s safety.
Offer estate planning. The reality of COVID-19 is that planning for the future is top-of-mind for everyone. Estate planning is more of an urgent need for many. Be prepared to get many requests in this area of expertise.

Rethinking landscape, maintenance, and mechanical services
Like legal and accounting, landscape, maintenance, and mechanical services are considered essential. It’s likely that there’s some level of service you can still offer to keep cash coming in. But, many of your services will take more time because of cleaning protocols or limited staff movement. Customers will not be inclined to pay more, so how can you get creative with your services?
Here are a few steps to take to save money and build a low-contact approach to your business.

Plan transportation thoughtfully. Reduced travel and commuting may mean you have to store vehicles that aren’t being used long-term. Car mechanics will also need to plan to provide support when commuting picks back up. Many customers may have trouble starting their cars after a long break.
Post DIY videos. Like salons, there are some services you offer which customers can handle themselves (with the right tools—sold by you, of course). Show your homebound customers how to fix a leaky toilet, stain a piece of furniture, or start a vegetable garden. Spring is the perfect time to capitalize on outdoor space.
Don’t discount retail. Parts and tools for repairs will still be in demand as customers try to complete DIY projects at home. Look at your inventory and see what you can sell through delivery or curbside pickup.
Publish your cleaning protocol. Communicate the safety and cleaning protocols your team is using for site visits, delivery, and in the store. There are recommended protocols for different verticals and services:

State by State COVID Guidance from the National Association of Professional Landscapers
OSHA Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19
The CDC’s Reopening Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting Public Spaces, Workplaces, Businesses, Schools, and Homes



Payment systems
Service industry businesses are notorious for asking customers to send payment using paper checks, even now in the age of electronic payments. According to one estimate, most businesses still pay 50% of their bills using paper checks.
Early testing shows that COVID-19 can last up to 24 hours on surfaces like paper and cardboard. Not only are paper checks potentially risky during this time, they’re also inefficient. Paper checks run the risk of delayed delivery, loss, and/or theft. Even just using checks costs money: businesses lose anywhere from $4 to $20 to cut, mail, and process each paper check.
Instead, look for a system like Bill.com, Paypal, Zelle, or Venmo—or even a plain ACH transfer —to handle your billing. Many of these systems also offer invoicing tools as well. Make it safe, easy, and fast for clients and customers to pay you, as well as for yourself to pay employees and vendors.
Keep the conversation going
Even though you may not be seeing your clients in person, staying in contact with them is important. Make sure your mailing lists are current, and notify your clients via email and social media about how your services are changing. Be upfront about what safety measures you are taking to keep your team safe. Make sure that these communications are in your voice! Service industry businesses are often personality-driven, so make sure that you bring your personality to all of your emails and posts.

Lapse in Appropriations Notice: On April 16th, the SBA posted a notification on their website saying that they were unable to accept new applications at this time for the PPP or the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL)-COVID-19 related assistance program (including EIDL Advances), due to lack of available appropriations funding. This resulted in Congress passing the aforementioned bill detailed in the section above.
Please read on for additional information regarding the CARES Act, PPP and the EIDL programs.
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act
On 3/27, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

The bill approved $2 Trillion worth of funds in an attempt to offset the economic losses experienced as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Roughly $350 Billion was allocated for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was designed to help small businesses make payroll and cover other expenses. Through the PPP, individual businesses could receive up to $10M, which was tied to payroll costs and can cover employees making up to $100K per year.
Economic Injury Disaster Relief Lending Program (EIDL)
The SBA’s Coronavirus Economic Injury Disaster Relief Lending Program (EIDL) offers low-interest loans in all U.S. states and territories for small businesses financially suffering as a result of COVID-19.
Click here for additional eligibility information.
Families First Coronavirus Response Act (H.R.6201)
The Families First Coronavirus Response Act responds to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak by providing paid sick leave and free Coronavirus testing, expanding food assistance and unemployment benefits, and requiring employers to provide additional protections for health care workers. The bill was signed into law on March 18, and goes into effect on April 2, 2020.
Click here for more details on how this may impact your business.
Federal Tax Relief
The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service have announced that the federal income tax filing due date has been extended from April 15 to July 15, 2020.
Although many states have aligned their State and Local tax filings with the Federal extension it is important to check your individual State requirements with their individual tax agencies.  Website for individual tax agencies can be found here.

In this installment, we chat...",28-05-2020,https://blog.clover.com/meet-the-merchant/meet-the-merchant-el-barrio-neighborhood-tacos/,"Our Meet the Merchant series features Q&As with real-world Clover merchants. Read our full catalog for innovative ideas and real-life stories of small businesses in action.
In this installment, we chat with Joe Lin, a co-owner of El Barrio Neighborhood Tacos in Redondo Beach, California. He shares how his new restaurant venture has adapted to changing circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Clover: Let’s start at the beginning. Can you share the origin story of El Barrio Neighborhood Tacos?
Joe Lin: There’s three of us: two owners and one managing partner. The origin story is a little bit different for each of us, but for me this started a passion project. I’ve always dreamed of owning a restaurant; I have a passion for food and do a lot of cooking at home. I grew up in a restaurant environment as a kid, and my parents were involved in the restaurant business, too.
I’ve known my business partner Jesse since middle school. He’s now been in the restaurant game for a while. A while back, he mentioned that he had someone in mind (our managing partner) who wanted to open up a new venture and asked if I’d be interested in coming along for the ride. So here I am.
Clover: What’s the inspiration for the cuisine you serve?
Lin: For whatever reason, having all grown up around this area, we’ve found that the Mexican food scene around here [always] felt one dimensional. There’s a lot of influence from Tex-Mex in particular. But we wanted to create something that’s a change of pace from a Mexican food perspective, a bit more fresh and more modern to spice things up a little bit.
With the food itself, we wanted to create better, more conscientious Mexican food with exceptional flavors. We knew we wanted to create something that would fit the neighborhood, hence “El Barrio,” which means “neighborhood” in Spanish. I think people want to eat well both from a taste and a health perspective. So we focus our menu to feature better proteins: we use all-natural proteins, and we get organics or non-GMO whenever possible. We were making our tortillas in-house prior to the coronavirus—we usually use an all natural non GMO masa from Oaxaca. Right now, we’ve switched to sourced tortillas temporarily to maximize safety.
Most of our recipes and techniques are family recipes from Ulises (our managing partner and chef). His family has a slew of restaurants all across Mexico.

Clover: Why did you choose Clover as your POS system?
Lin: I think it was just the ease of setup and the cost.
Clover: Those are great reasons! We know you’re a new business, having just opened your doors six months ago. How are you adapting to this very sudden shift to take-out and delivery only?
Lin: We actually closed our dine-in option the weekend before they announced closures of restaurants and bars. We were watching everything closely and had the feeling that things were going to get messier before they got better. So, we took some early precautions.
We decided to go completely touchless and set up online ordering. Now we don’t take any sort of cash transactions. We don’t even handle cards anymore. I think we probably shut down card handling within the first week of closing dine-in.
We try to protect our staff by not allowing people to come into our space. All of the food we set on a table that is blocking the entryway of our restaurant. We write people’s names on their corresponding bags, and they just grab and go.
Clover: Do you use any apps to help with order management?
Lin: We use Postmates®, Doordash®, and Uber Eats® to manage our delivery orders. We had to get a little creative with our family meal packs. Because we can only offer a limited quantity, we ended up using Acuity Scheduling, which I think is designed for salons. It’s an appointment scheduling app, but it allows us to post how many meal packs are available for a given day and let customers reserve them in advance. It seems a little strange, but it’s been very effective.
Clover: How else have you been connecting with your community during the COVID-19 crisis?
Lin: We were running a promotion where for every family meal that we sold, we donated a meal to a front line worker nearby. And we ended up donating over 130 meals in the first week of the shutdown.
We’ve also been involved with one of the LA Galaxy players here. He’s been working with us to help donate meals to the fire department, the police department, and some of the local clinics and hospitals as well. Every meal that he purchases we match.
Very recently we got involved with World Central Kitchen. They’re an organization to help feed those in need during disaster relief. They set up shop and partner with local restaurants to make food available for anyone who needs a meal.
